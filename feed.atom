The best part of Flesh & Blood's 5th anniversary for all players is that Crimson Haze, known to many fans as a vengeful ninja who helped get them into the game, is returning as the Ira, Scarlet Revenger. This is a new version of Ira, a hero card that anyone can get by heading down to their local game store and participating in a 5th anniversary celebration event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Daily Spin has once again made its return to NBA 2K25's MyCareer mode, and it could be the source of some amazing freebies to aid you on your journey.


One of the foremost vital resources to grind in MyCareer is VCs, which is the premium currency of the game. Of course, you can buy them with the help of microtransactions, but not everyone likes to spend money after paying a premium for the game itself. The daily spin might not always drop bountiful rewards, but you get something on a daily basis. The gifts can range from VCs to essential items like skill boosts, but they all count.


NBA 2K25 Daily Spin location guide


You can try out the Daily Spin right after creating your MyPlayer.



Go through the first phase of playing in the Finals.


Once done, talk with your friend for the introductory dialog.


When you're ready, step out of MyCourt.


If you go right from MyCourt, you'll come across the Arena.


If you go left, you'll come across the "Crocs" store and find the two affiliations - Elite and Rise.


The Daily Spins are located right in front of affiliation entrances.


Step in front of one, and press the X/A button.


Wait for a bit for the rewards to show up. If you're unlucky like me, there won't be any VC. But many have found VC from their spins, and some have received large amounts as well.

Most importantly, the spin is free to draw; you just need to travel to the location and spin the draw. This is the easiest way to earn valuable resources to add to your inventory. While VCs help you grow your MyPlayer attributes, other items can help improve the finer aspects of your build.


If you're not happy with the amounts of freebies, there are microtransactions. The Season 1 pass also rewards you with lot of items that benefit your MyPlayer build.

Players have been modding Baldur's Gate 3 ever since it was initially released for PC. However, as of the launch of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7, fans have a dedicated native mod manager and toolkit built into the game. This makes the game easier to mod than ever before, and that's almost certainly why so many players downloaded so many mods as soon as this update became available and was installed on their PCs.

I believe that the campaign is the best place to start with Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. It'll teach you the basic mechanics while also giving you an epic story to experience that blew me away and continues to do so every time I replay a mission. However, it's a time commitment, and you're going to need to make sure you've got enough to get through it before you can even contemplate exploring the wider multiplayer offerings.

Mbappe didn't get a 99-rated version as part of FUTTIES, but his TOTT card is immensely meta. In my book, it ranks every other striker item (yes, even the 99-rated Pele and Eusebio). If you haven't been lucky enough to get him from packs, the card could be yours via the SBC.

The Kylian Mbappe TOTT SBC has 15 tasks, all with their own conditions.

After completing the first request for Mr. Raccoon, his wife will show up the following day, and you’ll have access to her shop. The stock of her shop expands after completing each request for Mr. Raccoon, although she starts out with a selection of seeds that are usually obtained from Seed Spots.


In some cases, it’s possible to start with one item and barter up to much more useful items, such as the following:



Cave Carrot > Mixed Seeds > Raccoon Hat


Mystery Box > Golden Mystery Box > Magic Rock Candy



Here’s everything that she eventually sells, along with which request you’ll need to complete in order to unlock each item for purchase:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of the Blue Box manga can now mark their calendars, as the much-anticipated anime adaptation is set to debut on October 3, 2024. The series' official website recently unveiled a brand-new trailer and key visual to further heighten the excitement for this upcoming sports-romance anime. 


Alongside this announcement, the trailer offers a first listen to the opening and ending theme songs. Popular Japanese band Official Hige Dandism is performing the series’ opening theme titled "Same Blue." Meanwhile, Eve will provide the ending theme song, "Teenage Blue."




In addition to its television debut, Netflix will stream the first two episodes on October 3, with subsequent episodes following each television broadcast. However, the release schedule will vary depending on the region. The anime will also be available on a number of other sites, including Hulu and Prime Video.


For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Blue Box is a mix of sports and romance, though more focused on the latter. The plot is centered on Taiki Inomata — a member of the boys' badminton team at Eimei Junior and Senior High — and his crush Chinatsu Kano — an older girl on the basketball team. Most of their interactions are the usual greeting during their parallel morning training, yet their relationship takes a sudden turn when Chinatsu's family is forced to move.


Fans looking to dive into the story before the anime’s release can find the Blue Box manga available to read digitally on both VIZ Media’s platform and Shueisha’s MANGA Plus.

The hybrid shooter is shaping up to be way more than a novelty and has rarely dipped below the 140,000 concurrent player mark in the past week ever since it was officially announced last week.


Sadly, despite its early state, Deadlock has already caught the eye of enough cheaters to disrupt the game.


Cheaters love Valve games


Video game cheats are part of an industry whose real numbers are hard to find out, but we know cheaters permeate all layers of the competitive ladder in all games affected. Many games even see pros getting caught for illegal activity every year.

I’ve been following the Silent Hill series ever since Konami included a demo for the original game in the original PAL package of Metal Gear Solid. Was that a more charitable Konami from a nicer time in gaming, or had the company been evil all along and was trying to get 10-year-old me to pee his pants? I don't know, but I'm cool with either option because that demo changed my perception of what games could and should be.

The new balance patch is DBFZ's first in over a year and comes nearly seven months after the game received a long-awaited rollback netcode update on February 28. The patch was handled by Bandai Namco and the developer Arc System Works in a team effort. 


Version 1.38 focuses on increasing player options and game speed by buffing character damage and pressure sequences, and decreasing the effectiveness of over-centralizing mechanics. Other changes include buffs to anti-air attacks, invincible super moves, and the speed of normal attacks.

While it may be a remake of the 2012 original, RePop is also packed full of additional collectibles, gameplay elements, and even a new mode with an entirely different art style for damage effects when attacking those zombie foes.

The MP9 has just 34 skins to choose from in Counter-Strike 2. Many other weapons have upwards of 50 skins, so it's surprising to see how few the MP9 currently has. You can find these skins in Counter-Strike 2 cases, or by simply buying your favorite from the Steam Marketplace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Astro Bot is drawing in a giant crowd on the PS5, which is great news for PlayStation aside from one detail: Gamers are seeing just how bad their DualSense’s stick drift is.


As hype for Astro Bot has drummed up, quite a few people have decided to finally make their way through Astro’s Playroom. @CoreyHikari on X shares that the title “is a great way to see your stick drift.” A lot of gamers seem to agree, including one who noticed how awful his drift was after hitting the crash site in Astro Bot. In this way, the Astro games are a bit of a double-edged sword.


Got drift?




Everyone seems to be having a blast playing through Astro Bot. However, if your DualSense controller is busted, it may put a damper on things. One of the biggest features of the Astro Bot games is finding unique way…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley has a history of dropping new and exciting things into social media posts without commenting on them, and they seem to have just revealed something very exciting over on Twitter. 


If we take into account Dreamlight Valley’s history of randomly revealing upcoming additions without context, then this Twitter post indicates that players may soon be getting something that they’ve been waiting for for a long time — a Gem stall. 




Now, I’m the first to admit that there are some things about this picture that are a little odd, not least of all the fact that Scrooge is around a whole load of Gems and isn’t trying to hoard them away in his personal vault. 


Stalls in Disney Dreamlight Valley have, so far, always worked in the same way. Three items to purchase on the top row, and three items to purchase on the bottom row. By the looks of it, this may-or-may-not-be-coming Gem stall seems to have 12 slots, eight on the top and four on the bottom. That’s a whole lot of Gems.


Does this mean that we’re not getting a Gem stall? No, although we should probably hold off before getting too excited about the prospect. I have to admit that it would solve a lot of problems, particularly when it comes to crafting and gifting, as Gems are always in need and there are never enough of them to be mined. 


The last time we saw something like this come up on Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Twitter was back in April, when Gameloft revealed Daisy Duck’s Boutique with very little context and only in-picture clues to go off. 




Time will tell whether this Gem stall comes to fruition as the Boutique did, but it has sparked hope that maybe, just maybe, Gems may not be as elusive as they are currently before too long.

After besting Imurah earlier on in the Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 campaign, I thought the second battle with him would be tough but pretty much the same. I couldn't have been more wrong because this bos fight features the biggest foe you'll directly fight in the game, a Chaos Demon of epic proportions. So not only do you need to defeat a Chaos sorcerer, but you've got to do it while taking a hammering from an ancient god-like creature.

The Summer Summit is a chance for Jagex to show what it's been working on for Old School RuneScape that's still to come to the game this year and beyond. The game was initially released in 2013 and drew in far more players than expected thanks to its focus as an MMO experience that many remember growing up with before the original RuneScape was updated. As a result, new content for the game took a while to get into a rhythm, but this year leading into 2025 might be the biggest the game has ever seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent update on the anti-cheat systems in place for Apex Legends and the continued efforts of developer Respawn Entertainment to keep cheaters out of the game, the developer revealed some shocking information about the number of accounts banned. 


In its blog post, Respawn Entertainment explained that more than 6 million Apex Legends accounts have been caught cheating and subsequently banned since the game's launch. What I thought was the much more impactful statistic, though, is the fact that an average of 100,000 accounts are banned monthly. It's not hard to see how you top 6 million with that kind of monthly turnover, and it shows that there's a huge cheating scene around this highly-competitive battle royale title.

One of the top contenders for the coolest characters is the Straw Hat Pirates' very own swordsman, Roronoa Zoro. After all, he has a tendency to act cool and do some badass stuff, though it's probably to hide his clumsiness and knack for getting lost.


That being said, Zoro delivered some of the franchise's coolest and most memorable scenes. Here are 10 of them.

Right from the beginning, Zoro is already a hard-boiled character. He was captured by Helmeppo after he killed the latter's pet wolf. However, it wasn't just a simple case of animal abuse. The wolf was terrorizing the …]]></summary>

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

The fact that NHL, NBA, and Premier League streams will be blocked by major Canadian ISPs was widely reported. Yet, with significantly less fanfare, it appears that the UFC and MLB have also entered the blocking arena.

We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.

Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

"From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Most chilling of all, Aldi have discontinued their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.

With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

This week, music industry group IFPI revealed Operation Redirect, "the first operation of its kind in Brazil to target illegal sites associated with malware distribution." Intrigued by the announcement, we took a closer look and found plenty of drama.

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in stealthy Mimimi-style cone’em up Sumerian Six are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then I reflect on the statistically determined average age of a Gamer – what is it now, 36, 37? Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written about Diplomacy Is Not An Option since it launched in Early Access in 2022, when it was a light and frothy strategy game about smashing thousands of peasants to bits with physics magic. It's still that, but now it's getting a 1.0 release on October 4th.

Or I assume we have, for why else would we not have yet posted about the Steam Rhythm Fest, which began on Monday and runs until August 26th at 10am PT/6pm BRDST*.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently wrote about a game that aimed to recreate the old magic of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, a series of late-night, urban racing games that hadn't had a new (non-mobile) entry in 18 years. Oh, what a neglected niche those indie developers were filling!

Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might & Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based strategy RPG series, which began life under New World Computing in 1995. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom".
