We're the lucky ones on the Switch. Just Dance allows us to get straight into the groove of things by letting us use our Joy-Cons. To play the 2022 version on either Xbox Series X, Series S, or PlayStation 5, however, you need to download an app on your phone.

We fix our gaze again on James Tynion IV's body of work, beginning with Sandman: Nightmare Country and then Wynd. We also breakdown the beginning of DC's next big event, Flashpoint Beyond, which sees both Bruce and Thomas Wayne suited up as Batmen. Outside of comics, we gush about the short Thor: Love & Thunder trailer.
As always, the episode ends with a look ahead to this week's releases.

You normally pay through the nose to get a super-high capacity drive, but right now GameStop are offering a capacious 8TB model for just $100. That's half the price of the same drive on Amazon, and works out to just 12.5 cents per gigabyte - a level of value you'd normally only expect to find on drives that are far smaller. The drive is called the 'Seagate Game Drive Hub for Xbox', but of course it works happily on PC too.

One of the most significant inclusions to WoW with Wrath was allowing players to roll a character as the game's first new Hero Class, the Death Knight.

“Beyond that will be Update 2.5, and while we’ll be coming back with specifics on timing later, we can share that it will introduce a new playable Hero for all platforms: Jane Foster: The Mighty Thor,” Crystal Dynamics’ blog post reads. “Our Hero designs are driven first and foremost by their core comic book identities,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Evil Dead series has garnered its cult-classic reputation through its knack for b-movie thrills, ridiculous levels of gore, and the icon that is its leading man. Bruce Campbell, the face of the franchise, joins us today for another Rapid-Fire interview! We're grilling The Chin on the upcoming game from developer Saber Interactive, whether or not he will make an appearance in the next Doctor Strange film, and so much more.
PSA: There is explicit language throughout today's video.


Our own Alex Van Aken hosts today's video, ready to get the hard truths out of Bruce. We talk plenty about the game and what players can be excited about when they get their hands on it, including a look at which characters will be playable (Spoilers: You can play as Ash). Then, we discuss some of Bruce's most iconic roles and the ones he was rumored to be in. He also settles whether or not he was ever actually in Spider-Man: No Way Home or not. Finally, we play a few games with the legend, set the record straight on some internet facts, and take him through an acting exercise that fans won't want to miss.
Craving more from Evil Dead: The Game ahead of its May 13 release date for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC? We have you covered with Game Informer's latest cover story. Be sure to click the image below or head over to our YouTube page to see exclusive gameplay featuring both the survivors and the demon, and listen to last week's episode of The Game Informer Show for our hands-on impressions!

The announcement earlier this month of Return to Monkey Island was rather exciting for series fans of all ages, perhaps particularly those of us wearing comfortable shoes and considering a trip to the Garden Centre as a day out. Published by Devolver Digital, Ron Gilbert's studio (Terrible Toybox) is developing, and it will be a successor to the first two games in the series - The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge.
It's a project that looks set to bring together key creative figures from those first two PC releases, including Dave Grossman. Last week Adventure Gamers shared an excellent interview with both Gilbert and Grossman, along with some rather lovely screenshots of the game. As you can see below, it's going for a stylised 'modern' look.

Additionally, Microsoft announces its working with Ubisoft to bring more of the publisher’s games to Game Pass. That initiative kicks off with Assassin’s Creed Origins and For Honor: Marching Edition become available on Game Pass sometime within the next two months via the Ubisoft Connect App. Ubisoft games are no stranger to Game Pass. Rainbow Six Extraction hit the library at launch in January, and Rainbow Six Siege and the base version of For Honor have been available through the service as well. But with the long-running rumor that Ubisoft's Uplay will be rolled into a Game Pass subscription a la EA Play, this move could be the first step towards that reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media, the studio helmed by famed writer Amy Hennig, has announced it partnered with Lucasfilm Games to develop a new Star Wars title.
The upcoming game is described in a press release as a “richly cinematic action-adventure game” that will feature an original story. That’s about all there is in terms of details, as the project appears very early in development. 
“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig in the press release. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”
Hennig, best known as the chief creative mind behind the Uncharted series, is no stranger to working on the Star Wars license. Her last foray into the universe was EA’s ill-fated Project Ragtag, the canceled Star Wars title by the now-defunct Visceral Games.  
This marks the second major project for Skydance New Media, which was formed in 2019. Last October, Hennig announced her team was developing an original story-focused action-adventure Marvel game as its first title. We still don’t know anything about that game either, but having now two major Disney properties under its belt are big gets for the young studio. 
Now that the Star Wars license is no longer exclusive to EA, this new project joins the pile of several upcoming games from a variety of studios. Quantic Dreams’ Star Wars Eclipse was announced last December, and Ubisoft’s mysterious open-world game hasn't made a peep since its announcement last year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From niche series to Nintendo staple.
10 years ago today, Fire Emblem: Awakening was released on the 3DS in Japan. At the time the series had a core and devoted audience, but it had struggled to make a meaningful sales breakthrough outside of Japan. There was no doubting the development and storytelling talent of developer Intelligent Systems, though, and the background of the game's creation is now well known and repeated regularly. It was to be a final push for the series, with presentation, budget and an eventual global release on 3DS — if it struggled, like multiple predecessors had, the series may have died right there.
Instead something rather lovely happened. Along with a slowly reviving 3DS platform, the game found its feet in the West, even if the 3D characters in the game didn't have feet. We could all overlook that oddity, though, as the game captured imaginations and made it a must-have on the portable. This, remember, is after the West had to wait for it — it's the 10-year anniversary in Japan, but the 9-year anniversary in Europe (it arrived in North America a couple of months before EU). It was still a slightly scruffy and staggered global release, something that is now a rarity with first-party games, but that didn't prevent its success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a presentation today, Blizzard announced the next World of Warcraft expansion, one that takes players back to Azeroth. With a new cinematic trailer, the upcoming expansion Dragonflight was unveiled. Players will travel to the Dragon Isles, previously shrouded areas in Azeroth. Four leveling zones and a starter zone flesh comprise five new areas for players to explore in this expansion, with varied environments and encounters to check out.
coverage here.

And yes, you can now play as an all-new dragon race, The Dracthyr that is actually a new class as well. These dragons can only be the Evoker class - and only the dragon race can be Evokers. This is a hero class that starts at level 58 with its own starter zone. Check out the cinematic here!


A progression system overhaul and a look at profession systems are on deck for this rollout as well. A completely revamped talent system should offer players more versatility and options. Of note, the UI is also getting a fresh overhaul. These are a lot of significant changes to the core game, even if the new dragon class doesn’t entice you. You can also ride a customizable dragon around for a speedy powerful new traversal option.
Players level up to 70 in this expansion.  An alpha is coming soon, which you can sign up for on the official website. You can discover more about Dragonflight there too!
In addition, players who enjoy World of Warcraft: Classic, Wrath of the Lich King is unsurprisingly also coming back.]]></summary>

With The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles' release last year to rapturous praise — including from us in our review — it's no wonder Capcom is celebrating. We're already getting a concert next month, but that's not enough.

The brilliantly titled Supertan Marioner 3D Infinity World Adventures is sadly no longer available to play, but perhaps this might be for the best, as the game bins off the cleverly designed levels of legit Super Mario games in favour of a side-scrolling endless runner. Not exactly the sequel to Super Mario Run we were perhaps hoping for!

Formula Retro Racing is based on a particular era of arcade racers: namely, the very early polygonal era in which games like Virtua Racing (well, okay, it was really only Virtua Racing) were wowing arcade-goers.
As in Sega’s seminal arcade racer, Formula Retro Racing uses large, chunky polygons for its cars and tracks and has very little shading, giving everything an extremely clean and minimalist look. Back in the day this was necessary for performance, but in the modern era it’s strictly a conscious design choice and we’re all for it. Much like the Sega Ages re-release of Virtua Racing on the Switch, this polygonal art style looks exceptional in HD, and looks particularly striking on a Switch OLED where its bold colours pop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its shaky launch, Battlefield 2042 has received dev support in the form of multiple updates that address bugs and adds much-needed content to the game. Earlier this year, a scoreboard detailing ribbon progression, match stats, and more was finally implemented. And while there’s a list of features the community would like to see added to Dice’s frenetic shooter, VOIP (voice over internet protocol) has remained somewhere near the top. In today’s Battlefield 2042’s update, 4.0, limited voice chat options have been introduced.
But what does ”limited” mean? According to the official EA/Battlefield website, there are now “two voice chat channels to choose between: Party and Squad. Settings for VoIP can be adjusted via Options > Sound/Voice > Chat while in-game.” Sadly, you won’t be able to communicate with your whole team just yet, but this is definitely a solid start. Moreover, a Scoreboard UI refresh hit 2042 servers. Finally, a ton of weapon attachements, matchmaking/social, progression//unlocks, maps, and player character changes have been made for a more streamlined action experience. You can read through the extensive amount of fixes here.

A rare move for the company, this represents a push forward of at least a month, possibly two, depending on when Nintendo planned to release the game in September, a date we’ll likely never learn now.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/19/sega-reportedly-developing-big-budget-reboots-of-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio"/>
        <updated>2022-04-19T13:42:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report from Bloomberg states that Sega is developing big-budget reboots of two of its most popular Dreamcast games: Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. 
According to the Bloomberg report, which cites “people familiar with its [Sega’s] plans,” Sega is developing these reboots looking to tap into its back catalog in search of a hit like Fortnite. These two reboots could be the first of Sega’s Super Game initiatives that it announced last November. 
This begs the question: why is Sega looking to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio to be a Fortnite? Fortnite is a battle royale with plenty of crossover opportunities thanks to its live events and multitudes of outfits, and it’s free, which certainly lends to its popularity. Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are decidedly not like Fortnite, but perhaps Sega has more drastic plans for these reboots. Bloomberg also reports that Sega’s European studio is working on a first-person Super Game, so maybe that is the title Sega hopes to become its own Fortnite-like hit. 
The Crazy Taxi reboot has been in development for more than a year, and Sega plans to release it in the next two to three years. Jet Set Radio is also early in development, and the publication’s sources say both games could still be canceled. 
For the uninitiated, Crazy Taxis is a zany quasi-racing title where players are tasked with transporting passengers across town in a high-speed taxi, all while tracks from The Offspring (and others) play. On the other hand, Jet Set Radio is a game about rollerblading and graffiti, with flashy visuals in an area not unlike the shopping districts of Tokyo and a soundtrack that rips.
Both Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are beloved by their fans, so here’s hoping these reboots come to fruition as games we can all play one day.

Rumours that Nintendo is planning to release Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service have returned with a vengeance after an apparent leak of a Nintendo-developed emulator surfaced online. It's a system we lovely dearly in Nintendo Life Towers, and while we looked at the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games we'd love to replay on Switch last year, now seems like the perfect time to look at GBA titles we'd love to see come to Nintendo Switch Online — or, perhaps more likely, to the more expansive Expansion Pack tier.
Below is a list of 24 such titles. We've skipped any games that are already available on Switch in some form — Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, Harvest Moon, the Mega Man Zeroes, and Advance Wars (at some point) being the main ones — with one exception which we explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like an intricate set of Lego, the platforms of Lego Builder's Journey is available on has slowly been building up, and now the pieces are in place for the game to finally become available on PlayStation consoles.


As of today, PS5 and PS4 owners can take on all kinds of Lego building challenges in this relaxing puzzler from Light Brick Studio. The PlayStation 5 version has updated visuals compared to the last-gen machines, offering ray tracing like its Xbox Series X counterpart. New to the game is Creative Mode, which allows players to make their "most imaginative builds" a reality. According to a press release shared with Game Informer, this mode starts players out with a curated set of bricks to "create models and scenes, with virtually endless build plates to build upon." Outside of Creative Mode, the game includes its original single-player puzzles nestled within a story of a parent and child learning the importance of playing together.
Lego Builder's Journey is running out of platforms to release on, and it can now be played on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and iOS. You can read our review of it right here. 

Lego Builder's Journey recently made its way onto our top 10 list of Lego games. Check out its placement, and see where your favorite Lego game stacks up here. For a completely different kind of Lego experience, read our review of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which was released earlier this month.]]></summary>

Right now the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series seems to be sliding down The Pokémon Company's list of priorities - its only entry on Switch so far is the remaster Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX. Time will tell if an all-new entry is in the works, but it's a series that had a strong run on Nintendo's portable systems, in particular.
Shinichiro Tomie was a key scenario writer across the whole series, and Seafoam Gaming has shared an interesting interview talking about their work on the series and on other Spike Chunsoft franchises. Tomie-san was asked about the influences and inspiration for some of the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon plots, and they highlighted that it was a true team effort.

Still, while these may be old favourites that you’ve already sunk hours into on a desktop, you might still be wondering how these games play when transplanted to the smaller screen and gamepad-ish controls of a handheld. 


Liam was wondering it, anyway. Thus, he picked ten difference game genres from the most-played on Steam, asked me to play at least one game that would broadly represent each, and report back on which are the most (and least) suited to life on the Steam Deck.

The Contra Anniversary Collection, which released back in 2019 — and we absolutely adored the game when we reviewed it — is getting not one, not two, but three different collectors edition's. Why so many, you ask? Back in February, the original Contra celebrated its 35th anniversary (feel old yet?), so Limited Run Games thought "why not?" and went all out for this run-and-gun classic. Better than cake? We think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far from describing a game with adventure in it (that would include a lot of games!), the adventure genre is loosely defined as one that emphasizes narrative and exploration over action, which may also rely on light puzzle mechanics. In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts. Shooting for games that are rolling around in the zeitgeist right now, some of the genres’ towering giants are not listed here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has announced a landmark sales figure for its latest Shin Megami Tensei game on Switch, boasting a new seven-figure total for copies sold. Shin Megami Tensei V has officially sold over one million units worldwide. 
The news came from a tweet on the Altus_West Twitter account, dropping the monumental amount of sales for the exclusive Switch JRPG. The tweet only says the one million figure represents total worldwide sales but doesn't break down the number into units sold for each region.

Also embedded within the tweet, which you can see above, is a piece of art depicting the main character from SMTV drawn by character designer Masayuki Doi as a thank you to fans who purchased the game.
The turn of the year brought news of SMTV climbing to the top of the series' sales charts when Atlus claimed it had sold 800,000 copies, and it has only been steadily selling since. The previous entry, 2014's Shin Megami Tensei IV on 3DS, sold upwards of 600,000 copies, an impressive number for a franchise that hasn't quite hit the mainstream yet. On the other hand, SMTV still has a little way to go to catch up with the latest Shin Megami Tensei spinoff, Persona 5 Royal, which has sold more than 1.8 million copies worldwide, according to a story from Gematsu from last June.
Shin Megami Tensei V tells the tale of a modern-day student in Tokyo that's transported to an apocalyptic alternate reality and finds themselves wrapped up in a war between angels and demons. Read our review if you'd like to learn more about SMT V and see if it'll be your cup of tea.]]></summary>

For others, it’s a virtual workspace or a digital version of the world we already live in. The most commonly accepted version of the metaverse, though, is something that resembles Ready Player One where all of your favorite characters, friends, and family members interact with each other in a 3D virtual world. Or at least, that’s the most idealized vision of what the metaverse could be.
Of course, that’s not a reality at the moment and the closest something’s come might be Epic’s juggernaut free-to-play battle royale game, Fortnite. But long-running MMOs like CCP Games’ EVE Online might be just as close to what the metaverse may become:…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Panic's Playdate doesn't have a lot to do with PC. It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.
It's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era of 4K visuals, 3D spatial audio, and sprawling open-world designs, there's something oddly refreshing about a new handheld device trying to emulate the earliest Game Boy and Game & Watch experiences. Playdate is a retro-inspired indie handheld built entirely to deliver novel experiences in a pocket-friendly format. From its bright and friendly appearance to its often whimsical games, it's clear the Playdate's name was chosen with purpose. Like a meet-up between childhood friends, this is an experience meant to recall youth and simplicity. It aims to delight those who pick it up through an array of small, entertaining activities.
The Playdate makes an excellent first impression. The charming yellow handheld may be tiny, but it feels solid in hand. The buttons feel clicky and respo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is an upcoming compilation of 13 classic TMNT arcade games announced last month. As fans wait with bated breath for its release, Konami has revealed a physical collector’s box to further appeal to the Turtles diehard in you. 
Beginning today, you can pre-order a limited-run box that contains some one-of-a-kind goodies (which are pictured above). For $149.99 you'll get the following items:
Physical copy of the game with original box design by TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman 
Cloth poster featuring Kevin Eastman’s adaptation of TMNT: Turtles in Time (16” x 24”)
Multi-layer acrylic diorama of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo (4.5” x 5”)
Enamel pin set of five classic designs – The Technodrome, Turtle Blimp, Party Wagon, Shredder and Krang
Set of 12 translucent comic style character trading cards based on TMNT: Tournament Fighters with rarely seen appearances from Wingnut, Armaggon, Chrome Dome, War, Aska, Karai and more (3” x 5”)
Full-color artbook with 180 pages featuring a chapter dedicated to each of the 13 games in the compilation (5.5” x 8”)
Although the Cowabunga Collection is also coming to PC, this physical collector’s set is only available for the console versions of the game. That would be PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.
We've only seen this edition available for purchase at Target at the time of publishing, but keep an eye out on other retailers and online stores throughout the day as their product pages are updated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has released an official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder. 
This trailer comes just months before this sequel, which is directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, hits theaters. With the release of this trailer, Thor: Love and Thunder now holds the record for the shortest amount of time between a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie's first trailer and its release in theaters. It's hard to complain, though, because while we did have to wait a while for this trailer, now, seeing how great it looks, it's nice knowing we only have to wait a few months to actually see the movie. 
You can watch the official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder below:


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not much going on story-wise, especially when you consider we already know a lot about what the movie's going to cover i.e. Gorr the God Butcher as the villain, Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor, and more. In fact, Gorr isn't mentioned once in the trailer and we only get a few quick seconds of Jane as Thor right at the end of the teaser. 
However, despite that, we do get plenty on the whereabouts of Thor and where he's at mentally following the events of Avengers: Endgame, which is where we last saw him. As expected, he's put in some work to get back to his more cut physique (here's hoping we get an amazing workout montage set to some '80s music) and he's rolling with the Guardians of the Galaxy (this is also our first look at this team since Endgame). 
As for where Thor's at mentally, he seems less inclined on partying and fighting, and more about taking in the life around him and ultimately, living a peaceful and tranquil existence. 
To accompany today's teaser trailer, Marvel Studios has also released a new Thor: Love and Thunder poster, which you can view below: 
Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters July 8.

As for why, the studio said it was moving the upgrade’s development in-house and evaluating the scope of the update. However, many took “until further notice” as a not-so-great sign that the update was in trouble, especially in light of CDPR revealing that it’s no longer using an outside studio to handle the update and instead doing it in-house. Some reports referred to the delay as an “indefinite delay,” which often comes with the implication of “development hell.” 
In a new investors call, though, CDPR senior vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski explained that the delay is not in …]]></summary>

Instead, Waffle presents you with a grid of five intersecting words with all of the letters already present. Most of the letters are jumbled up, and it's up to you to identify the correct words and spell them out by swapping the letters with each other using as few moves as possible.

People then got excited, thinking this wordless tweet meant that Sony had acquired Kojima Productions. It caused enough of a fuss that Kojima did a follow-up tweet saying, hey, sorry, that hasn't happened.

Next week is looking to be just as exciting, if not more. But before we get to next week, we have an entire weekend to enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week on the Halo series, we saw Master Chief and Kwan headed off to their respective homes to seek some sort of resolution to both their problems. But were our heroes victorious in their respective paths? Join us on The Game Informer Show as we review "Homecoming," the fourth episode in the Paramount Plus show, and let you know if it continues to build on the success of the previous episode.


Your regular hosts are back for another round of hilarity and analysis that you've come to expect from GI's review of the Halo series. Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are breaking down this week's episode and have a lot to say about another step back for a series that includes some of the most iconic characters in video games.
We start the episode with the promise of answers to what's going on with John's memories and the artifact that somehow connects to what we can presume is one of the Halo rings. Those answers come at the end of the episode, but "Homecoming" spends far too much time drawing out those scenes, continuing the series' trend of poor pacing. On top of that, we finally find ourselves on Madrigal with Soren and Kwan, which continues to feel like a distraction from the main story we care about.
There are some positive aspects of episode four, though. Kai has followed John's lead and gone rogue by removing her emotions-blocking pellet and starts to see the world a bit differently. Her interactions with Miranda Keyes and the rest of the Spartans provide some levity and clarity and prove there is hope for the series yet.
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Travis Touchdown's most recent adventure from the minds of Suda 51 and Grasshopper Manufacture, No More Heroes 3 has been a Switch exclusive since it was released. But as of today, that all changes because Xseed has announced it's bringing NMH3 to more platforms this fall.
No More Heroes 3 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, according to a tweet from Xseed Games. An image embedded with the announcement shows off what looks to be collector's editions for the console versions. Included with these expanded editions are a CD labeled "musical selections" from No More Heroes 3, a Santa Destroy "MOE~" vanity license plate, and an art book.

April 15, 2022
I had the honor of reviewing No More Heroes 3's Switch release, and while I loved the combat and a lot of the humor, the performance, resolution, and overall drabness of the open world brought the experience down. Here's hoping that the game can benefit greatly when transitioning to more powerful hardware and maybe even throwing in some extras knobs to turn for the PC crowd. I gave No More Heroes 3 a 7.75 out of 10 on the Game Informer scale. Here's an excerpt to get a taste of what's in store if you dive into NMH3:

Indie publishers DreadXP have become so synonymous with tightly curated, intriguing horror experiences that it's hard to believe the original demo anthology that kickstarted that reputation is only approaching its second anniversary.
Regular RPS readers may already be aware that (a) I'm a huge horror nerd, and (b) I think the games published under the DreadXP banner are something pretty special. I was equal parts grossed out and charmed by the Lovecraftian dating sim Sucker For Love: First Date when I reviewed it back in January, and was pleasantly surprised by my time with the My Friendly Neighborhood demo at the recent Steam Next Fest. So when I was offered the opportunity to interview Ted Hentschke, Head of Productions at DreadXP, as part of a digital event at last month's GDC, you can hardly blame me for jumping at the chance.

The first few items on the 2022 to-do list are things we already know. A Cyberpunk 2077 expansion is in the works and will be in development this year, but it won't see the bright lights of Night City until it releases in 2023, as was announced on the CDPR Twitter account and in this same earnings call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite’s second season, Lone Wolves, is slated to begin on May 3 and brings a host of new content to the game. 343 Industries released a blog post detailing one of its most exciting additions in the form of two new maps: Catalyst and Breaker.
Catalyst is a sleek, though abandoned, Forerunner base that’s been reclaimed by nature. Expect plenty of foliage to cover its monolithic surfaces, and 343 describes Catalyst as a vertical symmetrical arena featuring suspended catwalks and a light bridge connecting the map’s two halves. 
Breaker is a Banished shipyard laden with debris situated on a dusty desert planet. Its centerpiece element is a giant plasma cutting beam moving across the map that players can battle around at their own peril or benefit. 343 describes Breaker as a “pseudo symmetric BTB” map. Catalyst and Breaker will support all of the existing multiplayer modes as well as the new ones coming next season. You can watch a video fly-by of both arenas in the video below.


Be sure to read 343's blog post for the developer's complete breakdown of these maps' inspirations and design elements. Lone Wolves will also introduce new story elements, modes, and cosmetics – 343 plans to spill the beans on those additions in the coming weeks.

I'm here driving the RPS bus alone, nobody to stop me as I careen down the motorway screaming and trying to slam on the brakes. But I can't, because a golf ball has rolled under the pedal!
You ride this bus long enough, you see games move in cycles similar to fashion designers, or those big ferris wheels at fairgrounds. Things come round, they peak, they go round again. Often a few different people independently notice an empty niche and start working on something to fill it, so you get a bunch of games with similar themes or styles coming out within months of each other. So I ask: why and/or how have a bunch of people identified golf as a gap in the market?

It's a player-vs-player murder mystery in which a murder is going to take place and players must uncover who-will-dunnit, unto-whom-it-dunn, and work either to prevent the crime or to make sure it takes place. It's out now and there's a launch trailer below.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/14/the-witcher-3-has-sold-more-than-40-million-copies-cyberpunk-2077-surpasses-18-million"/>
        <updated>2022-04-14T19:43:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red has released its 2021 Fiscal Year earnings, revealing new sales numbers for both its Witcher franchise and its latest game, Cyberpunk 2077. 
To probably nobody’s surprise, both The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077 have sold really well for CDPR. In fact, as of today, The Witcher series has sold more than 65 million copies, with more than 40 million of them being The Witcher III: Wild Hunt alone. Cyberpunk 2077, on the other hand, has sold more than 18 million copies. 


The last time CDPR publicly released sales numbers for its latest RPG, the studio revealed in April of last year that Cyberpunk 2077 sold more than 13.7 million copies in 2020. That means that between the end of 2020 and now – so roughly 16 months – Cyberpunk 2077 has sold about 5 million copies. That’s still an impressive number, to be sure, but it speaks to a larger drop off for the title’s sales in 2021.
Of course, many studios would be happy with selling 5 million in any amount of time but for CDPR, a studio with the Witcher series in its portfolio crossing the 65 million units sold mark, 5 million might not be as impressive. The perceived drop off is likely due to word-of-mouth about its post-launch state, its removal from PlayStation stores for six months, and more. 
CDPR has been working hard to shift the perspective on Cyberpunk 2077, though, having just released Update 1.5, which fixes many of the RPG’s problems and makes now the perfect time to play the game. Still, it seems Cyberpunk 2077 will remain in the shadow of CDPR’s Witcher series, especially now that we know the studio is working on a new Witcher game that will be made in Unreal Engine 5. 
But, as CDPR’s 2021 FY earnings show, Cyberpunk 2077 might get a boost when its Netflix anime, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, is released this year.

In the 1990s, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were ubiquitous in the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up scene. Whether you’re talking about the 1989 arcade game, 1991’s Turtles in Time, or the myriad other brawlers starring everybody’s favorite Heroes in a Half-Shell, Konami’s creations in the ‘80s and ‘90s are legendary.
However, just as the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre faded, so too did the luster of the Turtles’ legacy. Following the IP’s late-‘80s/early-‘90s boom, the fan base of TMNT shrunk considerably, and much like the movies, TV shows, and merchandise, the brand’s gaming output slowed.

That's not necessarily the case with the official licensed Dark Souls pen & paper RPG, which seems a touch sloppy. Along with giving one class starter gear it won't have the stats use, it has some spells and items which, going by the rules, seem unhelpful at best. The real Dark Souls starts here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark has a handful of subclasses that didn't make it over from the Korean version game to the Amazon Games' localized edition that was released in February. Thanks to a tweet from the Lost Ark team, we may be able to play one of those subclasses in the game very soon.

April 14, 2022
The tweet, which you can see above, only contains a GIF of a rotating bladed polearm that indicates and a date emblazoned below it of April 21 indicates the Gaivalier is set to arrive in an update next week. Also known as the Lance Master in the Korean Lost Ark, the Glaivier is a Martial Artist subclass that specializes in using spears and glaives, poking enemies with dangerous sharp objects from a safe distance. She can use her special class ability to switch between stances while fighting.
The Glaivier already has a page on the official Lost Ark site that gives a brief description of its playstyle and shows shows off some of the skills you'll be utilizing on the battlefield. Here's Lost Ark's description of the new subclass:
"The Glaivier has two distinct skill sets, each one is represented by one of her weapons, the spear and the glaive. The best way to leverage her eloquent, yet deadly form of martial arts is to find balance between her two stances."
If the April 21 date is truly the release of the Glaivier, we'll be swinging big deadly polearms in all kinds of badass ways in a week's time. If you're new to Lost Ark, its an isometric online action/RPG that you can download and play for free on Steam. I gave the game an 8.25 out of 10 in my review which you can read here. If you're a fan of games like Diablo, or want to try an MMO that's easy to get into, Lost Ark is a great game to check out.]]></summary>

After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South of the Circle is a narrative adventure centered on survival and romance in the midst of the Cold War that first launched in Apple Arcade in 2020. The game comes from Lumino City developer State of Play and is now being published by 11 Bit Studios, the team behind Frostpunk and This War of Mine. 
Unfolding during the politically charged 1960s, players control a climate scientist named Peter. As a Cambridge academic, he finds himself conflicted with the brewing global conflict, which drives a wedge between himself and his love, Clara. Peter’s troubles escalate during a trip when he crash-lands in Antarctica. Stranded, he must now survive the frigid landscape while reflecting on the personal and professional choices that took him to this point. 


State of Play says South of the Circle is inspired by narrative adventure games such as Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch and boasts a striking cinematic, minimalist art direction. It's unclear how gameplay unfolds, but the implication is that interactions will be on the minimal side of things. The game is brought to life by an ensemble cast including Gwilym Lee (Bohemian Rhapsody), Olivia Vinall (The Woman in White), Richard Goulding (The Crown), Anton Lesser (Game of Thrones), Adrian Rawlins (Chernobyl), and Michael Fox (Downton Abbey).
South of the Circle is planned to launch later this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

Since then, Motive Studios has shared new information through special behind-the-scenes live streams, and one happened last month that was all about the audio of the remake. 
Motive showcased new gameplay to highlight some of the audio changes it’s made in the remake so far, specifically regarding the famed Plasma Cutter and Pulse Rifle weapons. During the stream, fans were already discussing their thoughts on the weapon sounds in the live chat, and it seems Motive used those suggestions and feedback from elsewhere to modify the sounds even more.

As you can see in the Tweet above, Motive has changed how the Plasma Cutter and Pulse Rifle sound. Both sound a touch deeper and more focused than during the March Livestream. You can listen to the sounds of these weapons in the original Dead Space, how they sounded during the March stream, and how they sound now in that video, and the changes are quite stark for those tuned into the remake’s audio. 
Of course, these changes aren’t final, and it wouldn’t be surprising if Motive listens to feedback on the new audio to modify the weapon sounds further. The next time we’ll see more of this Dead Space remake will be during a special stream next month, focused on its visuals. 
Until then, check out the latest Dead Space remake gameplay and then read about how the team plans to learn from mistakes in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the four hulking Grey Knights under my command, teleporty sword boy was undoubtedly my favourite. Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Road 96 touts a procedurally-generated narrative about several teens crossing the border of the nation of Petria. Of course, we’ve seen our fair share of procedurally-generated levels in roguelikes. Still, the promise of a shifting, randomized story made Road 96 an ambitious experiment to watch when it dropped for Switch last year. And even though it might feel as if Road 96 flew under the radar, it was listed as one of the Switch’s best-selling indies in 2021! Today, DigixArt’s third title cruises onto PlayStation and Xbox. 
You can watch the Xbox launch trailer below:


The trailer showcases Road 96’s vibrant, cartoony aesthetic, but don’t mistake that for narrative lightheartedness. Political and personal tension lies at the heart of the adventure game’s dynamic storylines. While interacting with several NPCs (friendly or otherwise) and selecting choices that influence various outcomes, you’ll be exploring a wilderness hosting desert expanses, lush forests, and more. This all comes packaged in a 4K 60fps experience. As the trailer’s narrator states, “each decision could shape your destiny and Petria’s too. Time for you to hit the road.”

This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic Labs is no stranger to cute creatures featured in AR mobile games; it popularized the genre with games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom. But now, Niantic is betting on its own IP with the new AR experience called Peridot. 
The game is named after the critters at the center of the game. Peridots, or Dots as Niantic also calls them, are to be raised from birth to adulthood and can be bred to create new variations of Peridots. Because it's an AR game like Pokémon Go, you'll be able to travel with your Dots, who will help you find items in the world or can be used for a photo-op at a local landmark. 


Lifting some features from the Tamogachi or Nintendogs crazes (or, you know, real pets), you'll be spending time with your Dots by teaching them tricks, feeding them, and, yes, you can pet the Peridots. When breeding the Dots, you can mix and match them with your friends' creatures with different characteristics to create entirely new creature archetypes and combinations to diversify the species further. 

Niantic is looking to soft-launch Peridot in select territories and countries soon, although no exact locations or release dates have been specified yet. You can pre-register for Peridot on the game's website to get updates on when it'll be available. Expect the game to launch on iOS and Android devices when it becomes available.
Are you excited for this breeding twist on the creature collection genre? Let us know if you're going to be playing Peridot in the comments below!]]></summary>

Wait... Is it Steven Grant or Marc Spector? On third thought, is it Marc Spector or someone else? Regardless of who is in control at the moment, Moon Knight punishes evildoers and looks darn good doing it.
You will soon be able to add Steven and Marc's versions of this character to your Funko Pop and Marvel Legends action figure collections. Funko recently announced a handful of Pops based on this new show. The line consists of Moon Knight in his traditional garb (as Marc sees it), Moon Knight in a nice suit (as Steven sees it), and a comic book version of him that comes with a comic cover background. The wave also includes a Pop of Arthur Harrow, who may or may not be evil. Time will tell. You can see all of the Pops in the gallery below.

Hasbro is releasing two different Legends Moon Knight action figures, again showing off Marc and Steven's ideas of the character on the show. Both figures come with the appropriate weapons, along with a build-a-figure component.
Now we just need Khonshu action figures. Are you watching Moon Knight? How do you think it stacks up to other Marvel shows? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Taking on four players by yourself can be quite a task, but you have a plethora of wicked tools at your disposal.

Each different Demon comes with a special kit that syncs up with various playstyles, so let’s take a look at the three core Demon templates you’ll have available to play with at launch. Each one of these kits can be leveled up at the account level, so you can push experience points into your favorite for added lethality and efficacy.

That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

It's not just a big deal that Sonic is in Roblox, but according to a press release provided to Game Informer, this is the first time a "AAA gaming character has been officially featured on Roblox."

You can sprint around as the Blue Blur and his friends in a game called Sonic Speed Simulator within Roblox right now. In it, players can level up and increase their speed while running through "multiple unique worlds" and racing against friends for rewards. Those rewards include stat increases, pets, and Sonic character skins to dress up in. Gamefam has weekly updates planned as well as an "exclusive community Sonic the Hedgehog skin" if the game hits 10,000 likes from Roblox players.
"We've worked closely with SEGA to create an official Sonic the Hedgehog experience on Roblox that will authentically delight the hundreds of millions of Blue Blur fans around the world," says Gamefam CEO Joe Ferencz, in a quote shared with Game Informer. "We're proud that SEGA entrusted our talented team of creators to bring Sonic to the metaverse and deliver the highest velocity, and probably best-looking, game in Roblox history!" Gamefam has also partnered with brands like Sony, Mattel, and Ubisoft on other projects.

The Sonic Speed Simulator page says the game is in a closed beta currently. If you're interested in running a mile or two in Sonic's shoes, you can check out this official collaboration here.

April 13, 2022
The change in development teams on the new-generation upgrades was revealed through a tweet on The Witcher series Twitter account. "We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," reads the tweet. "We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice." A follow-up message says, "We'll update you as soon as we can. Thank you for your understanding."
Saber Interactive was the company working on the ports of Witcher 3 to the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft and had previously partnered with CD Projekt on the Switch port of the same game. No reason was given as to why Saber will no longer be involved, nor is there a timeline on the new expected release window. 
In recent months, CD Projekt has had its hands full with the new-gen ports of Cyberpunk 2077 released in February and is still planning to expand the game with new content. The studio also announced a new chapter in The Witcher franchise is coming and will be running on Unreal Engine 5 instead of the in-house developed REDengine.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/13/hello-games-next-ambitious-project-wont-be-a-no-mans-sky-sequel-outlaws-update-launches"/>
        <updated>2022-04-13T18:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man's Sky is a true rags-to-riches story. While early trailers of the massive universe were impressive, the game couldn't live up to that potential during its rocky early launch period. Of course, years (and awesome updates) later, No Man's Sky is an experience teeming with engaging content like base-building. In that same vein, the new Outlaws update launches tomorrow, focusing on the criminal underbelly of the galaxy. But, more importantly, Sean Murray spoke to IGN about Hello Games' next ambitious project and how it won't be a sequel to the trillion-planet adventure. It'll be something much more. 
Today's Outlaws update was briefly summarized by a list of bullet points in a recent Sean Murray tweet:
Outlaw Space Stations
Cloth Simulation
Outlaw Story
Smuggling
Solar Ship
Recruit Wingmen
Planetary Frigates
Improved Space Combat
Forged Passports
More Ship Slots
Bounty Missions
Planetary Pirate Raids


A blog post delved into further details. Players will get to explore Outlaw Stations, filled with contraband marketplaces, unique mission NPCs, and smuggling opportunities. Procedurally-generated Solar Ships were implemented to spice up cruiser collection, and immersive additions like thundering frigates and dramatic explosions will likely keep explorers on the edge of their seats.  You can learn more about what’s new to No Man’s Sky by watching the trailer above.
In other news, Sean Murray told IGN that Hello Games’ next project is strikingly ambitious, “Similar to No Man's Sky, it's the kind of project that even if we had a thousand people working on it, it'd still seem impossible.” What this new IP will be is anyone’s guess, but Hello Games has spent a long time honing their craft with No Man’s Sky’s seemingly infinite loop. In any case, it won’t be a sequel to the developer’s flagship title.
Are you excited for the Hello Games’ next title? What do you think they’re planning? Let us know in the comments below!

        <updated>2022-04-13T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[coverage here.

Blizzard has released a new video shedding light on the origin story of Overwatch 2's new hero, Sojourn. 
A trailer sheds light on Sojourn's background as a former Canadian special forces captain who worked alongside Overwatch during its peak. We still don't know much about her combat abilities beyond the fact that she's a damage-focused hero, but players will find out when Sojourn becomes playable in the game's upcoming PvP beta for PC. 


Speaking of that beta, it's set to go live sometime this month after Blizzard announced it was detaching PvP modes from PvE to get the former content out the door faster. Overwatch 2 still doesn't have a release window, and its development has been affected by factors such as Activision Blizzard's ongoing sexual harassment lawsuits, staff departures, and the publisher's impending acquisition by Microsoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game publisher Aspyr has announced that it will be acquiring development studio Beamdog. The news was revealed in a tweet this morning, one day after the two companies announced a new game together, MythForce.
We're excited to welcome the talented team at @BeamdogInc to the Aspyr family!
https://t.co/XLk0RtAxYJ! pic.twitter.com/Q8bITIDiTt
April 13, 2022
The tweet reads, "We're excited to welcome the talented team at Beamdog to the Aspyr family!" Other than giving a link to the MythForce website, no other information on the purchase is given. 
Outside of the new IP that is MythForce, Beamdog has specialized in remastering classic Dungeons and Dragons-related RPGs. The studio has previously released Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, Beamdog developed an online edition of the strategy board game Axis and Allies 1942.
Aspyr also has its hands in remastering and releasing games. The developer/publisher has been bringing back Star Wars games from the recently bygone eras, such as Star Wars: Episode I – Racer, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and the upcoming port of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Switch. While most of these games are straightforward ports, Aspyr is developing a from-the-ground-up remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which was announced at The Game Awards last year.
MythForce, the project tying these studios together before the acquisition, is a four-player first-person fantasy roguelite with art designed to resemble a Saturday morning cartoon. Check out the trailer for it in our story from its announcement yesterday. Mythforce enters Early Access exclusively on the Epic Games Store on April 20.]]></summary>

It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8-bit-style romp with flashes of greatness.

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.
The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.


While the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.

Here's what we're clicking on.

They just tend to bounce me off pretty fast, and a bit like with adventure games, when I get stuck I typically just get bored and do something else.
It took almost 70 levels for Reiterate to do that. That's a recommendation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with some graphics cards dropping in price, the overall GPU availability situation remains pretty dire. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they’re not immune to bonkers inflation, they’re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.


Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

In the last few months alone, we’ve endured the cursed nights of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand, called down sky lasers on the hordes of Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and now we’ve got ORX, a dark fantasy tower defence game that blows all of them out of their ditch water moats with its compelling mix of deckbuilding and real-time strategy. It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020. I’ve lost several evenings to it already, and lemme tall ya, RTS turtlers have never had it so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new RimWorld patch has brought "full support" for Steam Deck, updating the interface for Valve's handheld gaming PC. The excellent sci-fi colony-building sandbox is the sort of game I would most like to potter around the house with, maybe play a few minutes on the pot, so that's nice. Not that I would take a Steam Deck to the toilet. But in theory. Look, I'm just pretending this is about me so I don't have to accuse you of anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 3080 Ti and 3090 Ti graphics cards aren only a bit faster than the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 that came before them, but they are proving much easier to get ahold of at their (admittedly high) recommended retail prices. 
Today, Scan's selling both models at RRP, with the 3080 Ti costing £1049 and the 3090 Ti costing a cool £830 more than that. These are both high-end cards with a price tag to match, but the Founders Edition models are generally the cheapest you'll find - so we thought you should know about this unprecedented stock situation!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever played 2019's My Time At Portia (and given that game's popularity, statistics suggest a bunch of you have) you'll know the appeal. It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

Well, yes and no. The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.
