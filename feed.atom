When Marvelous revealed Farmagia during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, we saw a familiar concept wrapped in an intriguing package: an action RPG with farm sim elements, like those so fundamental in two of the publisher's biggest series, Rune Factory and Story of Seasons, but wrapped up in a monster-catching package. Instead of growing fruits of vegetables, you grow crops of monsters. And all of this is given form by Fairy Tail and Edens Zero creator Hiro Mashima's distinctive artwork.
In this new RPG, we follow Ten and his friends who are all Farmagia — magical tamers (or farming mages) that can control and fight with monsters. Finding themselves in the middle of a war, Ten and his friends use the power of monsters – and friendship – to prevail over all obstacles.

This Vampire Survivors update comes with over 20 new weapons, a couple of new passives, and a whole lot more.


To unlock the new weapons, you'll basically need to unlock the characters, which we have a separate guide for. Each character comes with a weapon, and you usually unlock that weapon for other characters by surviving with the original owner for a set amount of time. You can find these specific conditions in the Unlocks section of the game.

All you have to do is progress to a certain part in the story to claim your pre-order bonuses in Dragon Age The Veilguard.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where to access your Dragon Age The Veilguard pre-order bonuses


You can access your pre-order bonuses in Dragon Age: The Veilguard after completing the introduction prologue and gaining access to the Veilguard base of operations which is the Lighthouse. Without spoiling anything, the prologue is considered complete after your encounter with the Dragon Age The Veilguard antagonist Solas.


Once you've reached this part in Dragon Age The Veilguard you'll unlock your headquarters which is the Lighthouse. Between quests you'll come back to the Lighthouse, so it's a location you'll quickly get familiarized with.


In the Lighthouse, look for a chest in the corner of the Infirmary Room which is located in the southwestern room of the area on the Lighthouse map. The chest is named a Wardrobe and will be accessible throughout all of Dragon Age The Veilguard and servers as a spot to change and customize your cosmetic appearance including those you've earned via pre-order bonuses. No matter which edition or platform you chose for Dragon Age The Veilguard, your pre-order rewards are accessible at the Wardrobe in the Lighthouse for the entirety of the game.


If you activate a code that unlocks more cosmetic rewards or pre-order bonuses, you will get a notification when you next play Dragon Age The Veilguard that indicates that the rewards are now available at the Wardrobe in the Lighthouse. Simply return to the chest in the Infirmary Room and interact with it to access any new rewards you have unlocked.

There are five weapons in Hades 2, and each comes with its own set of Daedalus Hammer upgrades. Said Hammers will alter how your weapons work, either by changing the way they attack or by affecting your other abilities in some substantial way. Let's just say that, if you spot the Hammer symbol on a door, you should absolutely go for it unless you feel your build is good enough.

Each time you open up a booster pack in TCG Pocket, you’ll earn five Pack Points. These can then be saved and then used to effectively “craft” chase cards. I don’t mean that you can get some glue and do some arts and crafts, but you can spend the points to guarantee the appearance of a chase card in a booster pack.

Truth Enforcers is a Premium Warbond for Helldivers 2. You can unlock it by spending 1,000 Super Credits (SC), roughly $10 in real-life money. Super Credits is a premium currency that can be discovered while playing the game, but you can make up for what's lacking by purchasing some in the in-game store if that's what you want. Keep in mind that Premium Warbonds are optional, supplying buyers with new guns, gear, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Florian Thauvin World Tour SBC is available in EA FC 25, and it marks the beginning of a new season in Ultimate Team. 


Season 2 is already live as well, and France will be the nation in focus during the next few weeks. Thauvin is the first of many French items that are expected to appear during the next few days. Let's take a look at how to complete this challenge in Ultimate Team.  


EA FC 25 Florian Thauvin World Tour SBC solutions


The latest World Tour SBC has three different tasks, and here are their solutions. All three tasks have pretty reasonable conditions as well, making it ideal for beginners. 


Task 1 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 81



Solution



Any 10 81-rated cards


Fleury 79



Task 2 - Serie A



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 82



Solution



Any 9 82-rated cards


Marcus Thuram 83


Any 1 81-rated item



Task 3 - 83-rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 83



Solution



Any 11 83-rated items



Should you complete the Florian Thauvin World Tour SBC in EA FC 25


Thauvin's 86-rated looks really good for its price and also fits well with a host of other promo items from Serie A. He can also fit well in a France-based squad and offers two different roles - Advanced Forward+ and False 9+. 


With Aerial, Trivela, Finesse Shot, and Technical, the card has some good playstyles as well. Everyone can get this item for a cheap price, which makes it even better. I am expecting plenty of One Nation-themed objective sets to come in Ultimate Team, which makes it even more important to complete the SBC. 


It's highly likely that you'll be able to evolve the card in the near future as well, which is only going to make it better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wonder Pick is a system in Pokémon TCG Pocket that allows you to choose one card from a pack that another player has opened. The other player doesn’t lose any cards, and you stand a chance to get a really cool card for your own collection. 


Just like with the booster packs themselves, you have to rely on Wonder Stamina to let you take part in Picks. You can have a maximum of five Wonder Stamina at any time, and each Pick uses up a certain number of your Stamina. Each Wonder Stamina takes 12 hours to regenerate, so if you run out completely, you’ll need to wait 60 hours to be refilled.


However, also just like Pack Stamina, there are ways to speed up this process and get some Wonder Stamina back much more quickly, giving you another chance to get some cool cards.

The primary way to unlock new cards in TCG Pocket is by opening booster packs. At a base level, you get two booster packs to open every day, and they can be opened 12 hours apart. Why? Because it takes 12 hours for your “Pack Stamina” to refill, allowing you to rip open another pack of five cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon TCG Pocket (or TCGP) is the latest Pokémon game to hit mobile devices, and it’s such a hit that it leaves many wondering if it’s coming to PC. While being a game that you can progress in both offline and online, will people be able to take this to a bigger screen?


Is Pokémon TCG Pocket on PC?


Currently, the new Pokémon TCGP game is not available on PC, and there don’t seem to be any plans to bring it to that platform.


However, while not a fully legitimate way, you may eventually get the game on PC via emulators like Bluestacks. As of now, the game is not out yet for the program. You can currently pre-register for the Pokémon TCGP app so when it does come out, you can start downloading it right away.

Is it safe to play Pokémon TCGP on Bluestacks?


For most games, it should be safe to install this game on emulators like Bluestacks when it does come out. 


The game being on a PC would make it easier to get hacks, exploits, and other tools to get ahead. To best avoid getting banned or blacklisted by any means, just stick to the game downloaded by the program and don’t follow any external links for free stuff.


What platforms is Pokemon TCGP currently on?


Pokémon TCG Pocket is currently on Android and iOS. 


You will need Android 7.0 and up to play this game on your game if you are using an Android-based device. As for Apple, you need to be on iOS 13.0 and up to run the game. 


As for the performance of the game, it will depend on the specs of your mobile device. Newer ones should play this just fine, but you can alter the performance to conserve battery life or make the game run smoother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to complete your quests in Dragon Age: The Veilguard without any hassle, you'll have to know all about your enemies' weakpoints to do maximum damage.


With plenty of time between the upcoming Dragon Age game and the older titles, there are some obvious changes under the hood. In combat, paying attention to your enemies' weakpoints will allow you to erode their health pool faster. It's also pretty easy to hit the soft spots of your foes once you know where to hit, and there's a proper indicator available as well.


All weakpoints in Dragon Age: The Veilguard


It goes without saying that weakpoints will vary based on your enemies. One of the best things to do is to go for the head. Much like your critical shots in Call of Duty Black Ops 6, going for the head will likely do the job for most enemies. You'll be surprised how common it is.


Once you hit the weakpoint of an enemy, the damage text will show up in purple. That's the indicator that you have hit the correct spot. However, a few enemies have some unexpected areas to target.



Archdemon Razikale: Chin/Forehead/Neck


Blood. Forge Prime: Open Mouth Furnace


Greater Sentiner: Orb in the torso region


Greater Hurlock Blighter: Orange pustule


High Dragons: Glowing legs/underbelly (if you manage to stagger it)

How to get more weakpoint damage in Dragon Age: The Veilguard


The core process is simple in this case as well - just use a better weapon. But in the long run, you'll want to focus on your class and their areas of specialization. For example, Warriors will do more damage to Staggered enemies, while Mages do a lot of elemental damage. Hence, you'll want to boost all skills that empower your core abilities.


This is the best way to amplify the damage you cause by hitting an enemy's weakpoints. There are, however, no abilities to my knowledge that strictly target the soft spots of an enemy.

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 "Genoa" flagship model. Here's a look today at how the AMD EPYC 9655 1P/2P 96-core processor compares to the prior EPYC 9654 flagship.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get in.
Wow, that's a lot of new releases. Yes, thanks to Famitsu, we now have a view of the latest charts data from Japan, and despite an avalanche of new games (several duplicates, granted), Super Mario Party Jamboree has managed to hold all of them off to claim the top prize. Now of course, if you add together the sales for every SKU for Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, it's easily sold the most, so that's something to keep in mind.
Otherwise, we've also got Sonic X Shadow Generations coming in at number ten with 7,021 copies sold, showing that the franchise's popularity in Japan really isn't quite what it used to be; certainly not compared to the West, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a real “Will they, won’t they?” dynamic between Vampire Survivors and Castlevania. It’s the crossover that makes the most sense, but it’s because it makes the most sense that I believed it wouldn’t happen. Time makes fools of us all.


Ode to Castlevania is funny because Vampire Survivors is already an ode to Castlevania. Nowhere is this more evident than with the new weapons that don’t have a lot to do with Castlevania. That’s because all the weapons most associated with the game were already in it originally, from throwing crosses to holy water.


But I’m getting ahead of myself. By default, a Castlevania crossover is going to be the best expansion for the game because I love Castlevania. However, it’s also the best expansion so far for other reasons.

There are a total of nine games, including spin-offs, set in the world of Dragon Age. While it’s not strictly necessary to play all of them, it can be useful if you want to immerse yourself in the lore. 


Before getting into the games that you can actually still play, here are a few honorable mentions for Dragon Age games that have been lost to the aether:

Fittingly arriving just in time for Halloween, The Bunny Graveyard sees you play as a computer cursor, tasked with helping a cute bunny uncover the truth of her existence. Doesn't sound too scary, right? Well what if we told you there's a menacing computer? Creepy creature jumpscares? Fishing minigames? Yeah, now we're feeling the chills.

Digital card games like Marvel Snap have seen a lot of success in recent years with short, satisfying matches that you can finish in a few minutes. The mobile release of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket almost seems like a direct answer to this trend. From uncomplicated card text to simplified rules, it axes much of the complexity of the original Pokémon TCG while still wrapping it up in an addictive collection loop that looks to have players checking their phones daily and maybe even spending real-world money on microtransactions to get more cards.
After spending a little too much time opening booster packs and battling friends and randoms, we can say TCG Pocket is as predatory as a Pidgeot stalking a Caterpie and more mesmerising than a Swoobat using Attract. On the collection side of things, at least.

Na programu je 54 přednášek a workshopů. Témata jsou od silně technických témat jako je třeba GCC nebo PostgreSQL po méně technické témata jako eGovernment, nebo třeba detailní analýzu problémů s Digitálním Stavebním Řízením. Vypíchnout lze přednášky linuxových distribucích Fedora Silverblue (Nerozbitný linux pro celou rodinu), openSUSE Leap, nebo Turris. Nesmí chybět témata jako kontejnery (Kubernetes) nebo umělá inteligence (velké jazykové modely). Už tradičně si můžete zkusit nakreslit mapu OpenStreetMap se zkušenými lektory od Missing Maps. Pro bastlíře je nachystaná například přednáška o chytré domácnosti Majordomus nebo o Linuxu v ledničce. S cílem přitáhnout mladší generaci představujeme studentskou sekci, kde jsou jednotlivé projekty dílem studentů (například v rámci jejich maturitních prací). Bude řeč i o výuce programování na základní škole, nebo výuce fyziky pomocí arduina "Physibox".

Mimo hlavní program bude na chodbách spoustu stánků různých projektů jako je Fedora, openSUSE, Grafana. Stánek budou mít i radio amatéři a 3D tiskaři. Pro děti bude v sobotu nachystaný dětský koutek, kde si děti budou moci vyzkoušet různé hračky pro výuku programování. V neděli se dětský koutek promění v PlayZone od OMG Robotics. Sobotní odpoledne tradičně zakončíme posezením u lahodného moku ve studentském klubu u Kachničky.

Budeme rádi, když myšlenky naší konference budete šířit a pozvete své kolegy a kamarády. Jak jistě víte, tak konference je primárně v češtině a vstup je zdarma.

Pokud máte nějaké otázky, tak se zkuste podívat do FAQ nebo se zeptejte na Matrixu, Telegramu nebo emailem.]]></summary>

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's inclusion in Nintendo Music was a given, but we were curious which version of the iconic Fire Temple theme would make the cut. Would it be the original, which Nintendo swiftly replaced after discovering that a religious chant was sampled in its mix? Or would it be its chant-less replacement, which was ushered in on 1.2 cartridges alongside Ganondorf's newly greened blood? Well, it's neither.
The Fire Temple theme listed in the app's OOT library is only 41 seconds long, providing the percussion-heavy opening and two rounds of the twinkly motif before fading out. Things wrap up right around where the chanting would normally begin, and there's no option to extend the track, either.

It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up.

Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am once again asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you Ian Games for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).

"Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: "Nazis? I hate these guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting!

In this adventure game, you're looking into the killing of a close friend, shot by an unknown assailant. You hop between two dimensions to solve the case - one world in which your pal still lives and the other in which she's dead. Unfortunately for the murder victim, you play a bona fide hot mess who could not perform a cross examination if she were standing in front of a crucifix with a magnifying glass.

Sin very nearly liked Stasis: Bone Totem, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with Beautiful Desolation - an isometric RPG I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror FPS Animal Use Protocol, they both featured considerably less monke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets.

I wrote about a very rude Minesweeper "homage" instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 


Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025.

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

But the word "ambivalent" already exists. So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s one thing I’d like to get across about my time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard - perhaps a surprise given Bioware’s recent history, Anthem, and some of the early marketing for this game - it’s that in my 50 hour return to Thedas, I very rarely felt I was playing something cynical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've often thought lighthouse keeping would make a fine second career, albeit mostly because in my head, it would give me endless time to write (and finish Baldur's Gate 3). You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Pah. A skill issue if I ever saw one, honestly. Decade is a fascinating adventure game that drew me in with its apparent vagueness but then, like some sort of considerate, sensible coward, went on to explain itself well in on its Steam page.
It’s the end of the world, and you’re not too happy about it, so you’ll be shoving children in a time machine with little more than a rotting Lunchly and some instructions to help you figure out exactly what went wrong.

Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the AACS were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish "online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings".
Last Friday, as per a statement released by the VGHF and spotted by PC Gamer, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look up major events in 2011 and there's some world-changing stuff... and some not so world-changing stuff. Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

Currently known as Project Uso - the Swahili word for 'face', 'appearance' or 'surface' - it'll take place in the same world as Kenzera, and will take inspiration from Surgent Studio founder Abubakar Salim's experiences of parenthood.

If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project. Kaiju ambitious.

In parallel, legal streaming platforms are enjoying huge growth as business booms.

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montpellier's Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive.

All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.

The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.

We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.

Wilmot's Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi. This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Move over Hollow Knight," declared Katharine (RPS in peace) in our Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review, summarising this freshly-honed hunk of POP art as "a deep and challenging Metroid-like with some of the best platforming this side of Moon's Ori games." Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

I could theorise on the fictional conceit of bringing packaged creatures to life using a microwave and also, sometimes, a blender, but to do so would be to stare into a gift horse’s abyssal oat hole so intently that…
…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”
Thanks for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was little, I really liked what I saw of Shin chan, even if it was just largely flashes of his bare arse on Japanese TV. He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as… jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

While Woolen seemed unconcerned when the news reached him, the NFL, which actively combats piracy, will likely take a different view.

Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.
It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish streaming service CDA has once again been accused of being a notorious piracy market by the Motion Picture Association (MPA). CDA sent a rebuttal to the US government, dismissing the claims as false and misleading. In addition, the company points out that the MPA was provided with a direct takedown tool but has never used it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RailGods Of Hysterra is one of those games that, as it were, shovels a bunch of relatively dried-up concepts into the squirming furnaces of something appealingly ghastly. On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-building" and "survival" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a climactic scene of the original Final Fantasy VII, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

The subsequent nationwide blackout, affecting millions of Italians, wasn't just a hapless IP address blunder. This was the reckless blocking of a Google.com subdomain that many 10-year-olds could identify as being important. Reckless people and internet infrastructure, what could possibly go wrong next?

The ongoing Steam Next Fest has no shortage of these gambley gimmickers, but here's one demo that stood out.

Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets. You'll get into hectic scrapes with a giant blob man and come out of it sweating and swearing, and possibly alive. It is tactical, deep, instinctive, and an interesting work-in-progress. It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake developers Remedy have announced their very first multiplayer game, a three-person co-op shooter set in the world of Control and thereby, the Remedy Connected Universe. Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for Alan Wake 2's second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bohemia Interactive have announced that Arma 4, the next big instalment in their shooter simulation series, will release in 2027. The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backyard Basketball, is finally ready to come off the bench for some sweet public testing! You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!
Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.
Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!
