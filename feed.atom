Stockpiling a large amount of Fiberglass is necessary if you plan on building some of the most useful C.A.M.P. items in the game.

Whether you're farming fiberglass to create the C.A.M.P. of your dreams or to knock out the Seasonal Challenge, you'll want to know what the best items that scrap into Fiberglass are. This guide will identify the best Fiberglass items and the most efficient farming locations for each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In NBA 2K24, scoring baskets from the tricky spots can often make the difference, and knowing how to set a screen is crucial. 


In easier difficulties, it's pretty simple to score the baskets. As you face more challenging opponents, the open spaces on the court reduce drastically, minimizing the chances of scoring a basket. When you call for a screen, it signals one of your players to come short and create space for your ball handler. This extra space, when done at the right moment, can catch the opposition defense off guard. 


How to call a screen in NBA 2K24


You have two options when trying to set up a screen - call a random player or call a specific player. If you go for the first option, the game will automatically consider a suitable screen. This process might be the less efficien…]]></summary>

Thankfully, the one and only theatrical outing for the year, Deadpool & Wolverine, doesn't appear to take that status lightly. As evidenced by the film's promotional material, Marvel fans are in for a wild, profanity-laden, Multiverse-exploring adventure with the Merc with a Mouth (Ryan Reynolds) and his not-so-close friend, if you can call him a friend at all, Logan (Hugh Jackman).


Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine contains a lot of moving parts. As noted previously, it's a Multiverse story at its core, meaning that it will likely take audiences across different universes and beyond as the narrative unfolds. It's also more of a formal introduction of the …]]></summary>

Let's look at the best Fantasy Horror books you can read to get into the genre.

The King in Yellow (Robert W. Chambers)


The King In Yellow is one of the best introductions to the world of horror fantasy that anyone can ask for. It tells not one story, but nine which were highly influential to most other Fantasy and Non-Fantasy Horror writers that came after.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to both science fiction and fantasy, authors have a habit of writing multi-book epics rather than single, one-time books. So, if you're looking for a standalone sci-fi tale to enjoy and don't want to have to invest in multiple books, these are some of the best to pick up.


I will admit that I love a good series of science fiction books, be it the huge Culture series by Iain M Banks or the two-part space operas of Peter F Hamilton's Pandora collection. However, sometimes, it is nice to have a single book that tells the whole story. Every sci-fi adventure doesn't need to be thousands of pages long. So, I have dug through my libraries to find some of the best standalone science fiction books I can think of.

The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien)


While we cannot unsee The Lord Of The Rings as a trilogy nowadays, the whole thing was conceived as one single story. Good, because even though you'd still have an explosion of enjoyment in your brain by reading just one of the books — especially if it's your first contact with the series — LOTR is bigger than the sum of its parts.

Rudiger and Germany might have fallen short at home in the Euros, but he was consistent with his performances.

What sets The Broken Earth series apart is that it toes the line between sci-fi and fantasy. I always love books that do this because science was deemed magic for so long in our history until it was understood. When you take that idea and apply it to the future, though, it seems so much scarier. That's exactly what you'll find in this series, which consists of a main trilogy and a side story to enhance your understanding of the world.

Parks is a board game that celebrates the beauty of the United States’ national parks, from the deserts of Joshua Tree to the Everglades of Florida. You’ll play as two hikers, collecting memory resources from the places you visit over the course of several seasons. The card art perfectly captures the scenic vistas and iconic sites of each park, so that by the time you finish the game you’ll want to start planning…]]></summary>

They're awesome! Why is it, then, that dinosaur-themed video games are neither here nor there, with so many of them being multiplayer experiences, specifically?


Note, too, that I'm not talking about the usual suspects her. The mainstream dinosaur-themed games like Ark, Dino Crisis, and Exoprimal (though you might be hard-pressed to call the latter mainstream) have some strange sci-fi quirks that - in my book - take away from the dino fantasy angle. No, today I'd like to talk about games such as Path of Titans, The Isle, Beasts of Bermuda, and Isles of Yore. This is an inexhaustive list, too, so the odds are good that you may come…]]></summary>

Speaking with Edge Magazine, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke revealed that Baldur's Gate III was one of only a handful of titles it considered at the time. However, it also considered making pitches for a new Ultima or Fallout.


Ultimately, Larian went with Baldur's Gate III, as the franchise was languishing following the closure of Black Isle Studios. Svicke tells Edge it was a franchise he knew would get plenty of traction, saying Baldur's Gate was "one of those IPs that you know a lot of people will want to work on."

If you’re new to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, you’ll soon discover that there’s more to the author’s acclaimed fantasy sagas than The Lord of the Rings, which can make it difficult to know where to start reading. Good thing we’re here to make sure you start your adventure right.


How Many Lord of the Rings Books Are There?


The Lord of the Rings is a single work divided across three volumes. As a result, it’s commonly referred to as a trilogy. However, there are many other works published in J.R.R. Tolkien’s name that expand the world of Arda and Middle Earth.

These new scrips, added in Dawntrail, can be exchanged for the current highest level crafting and gathering gear, but getting your hands on (or crafting) the items you need to hand in isn’t easy. 


Orange Scrips can only be earned once you’ve reached level 100 in a class, and there’s currently only one recipe per class which will reward them when handed into a Collectable Appraiser. The higher the collectability rating of an item, the more Orange Scrips you’ll receive for handing it in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the established maintenance schedule for Final Fantasy XIV, we’ve known for a while that The Arcadion will be coming on July 16. However, we now have a time set in stone for this patch, so here’s when you can dive into the WoLs tournament arc. 


According to a Lodestone post added on June 12, the maintenance period that will implement patch 7.01 will take place at the following times, depending on your location:



PST - 11 p.m. on July 15 - 3 a.m. on July 16


EST - 2 a.m. on July 16 - 6 a.m. on July 16


BST - 7 a.m. on July 16 - 11 a.m. on July 16



Both the Companion App and Lodestone will also undergo maintenance during these times, and normal rules around maintenance apply.


This patch will, of course, introduce the first four fights in The Arcadion raid series, which will see the WoL set against a series of opponents in tournament-style battles. 


Thanks to a sneak peek given during the last Live Letter from the Producer (82), we know that the first tier of fights (1-4) will be called Light Heavyweight, and the first of these fights will see us face off against what appears to be a Miqo’te who certainly doesn’t skip any days at the gym. 


Screenshot via FFXIV YouTube


Patch 6.01 will only see the release of normal difficulty Arcadion fights, with their Savage variants being added on July 30 with patch 6.05. 


At the end of the Dawntrail MSQ, after the credits, we saw a mysterious Lalafell re-open the Arcadion, but this will be the first time that players can actually enter. There’s no telling who we’ll be up against, but it’s certainly an exciting prospect, given how interesting some of the newly added mechanics have been so far.

Recently, Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment announced that Division 2 would essentially adopt the Diablo 4 seasonal model, switching over to time-limited seasonal characters for progression. Not a popular move.


Since the announcement was made, Division 2 players were understandably unhappy with the fact that they'd no longer be able to take their Agents through seasonal content. Instead, they'd have to rely on seasonal characters to make progress, while legacy Agents would be left to languish in old, out-of-date content. Thankfully, Massive Entertainment appears to have taken the players' feedback to heart, to some extent, and the studio has now announced that it's going to "re…]]></summary>

Certain series never stop, but it seems the Trails games (which are now 20 years old) are getting to the point of completion.
Speaking to GameSpot recently, the Nihon Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo (who is also one of the key devs behind Trails) mentioned how the main story is now "about 80-90% complete" and while there could be "another arc", whatever happens next wouldn't continue much longer and don't expect to see a "30th or 40th anniversary".

The hopes and dreams of the future were tarnished by the horrors witnessed by all. This caused a lot of science fiction to be much more dystopian. However, if you're looking for a sci-fi novel to read that isn't based on apocalyptic doom and gloom, pick up one of these utopian stories.


Finding the best utopian sci-fi books


I should prelude this list with the point that just because sci-fi is based in a future utopia, it doesn't mean there isn't struggle and conflict in the books. Without either of those things and a perfectly happy, harmonious world, the book would be incredibly dull. Nobody wants to read that. So, although the universes of these sci-fi novels are …]]></summary>

The action is fun and frantic, but it can be stunted when the character information overlay bug crops up. 


When picking your hero in Concord, you can view information about them and their abilities and get a good idea of how you should be playing to make the most of everything they have to offer. While this is great, it actually just ends up getting in the way if it sticks around when you jump into a match after picking them. Thankfully, there's a pretty easy way to fix this error when it happens to you that doesn't involve restarting the entire game and the platform you're playing on.

With 16 characters to play as and master, and many maps and game modes to compete in, there's a lot to get your head around in this title. With early beta codes and other promotions being distributed by the developer through various channels as well, it can feel a little overwhelming when trying to get into the game and find a solid group to play alongside as try to complete challenges, unlock new skins, and rise through the ranks as a team. That's why the Discord server and other communities are so important.

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.

Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve had some fun with The First Descendant but I wouldn’t say a strong, distinctive art style is one of its core virtues. It’s a pretty derivative game from head-to-toe. Now it turns out that some of the free-to-play loot shooter’s in-game icons appear to be ripped almost wholesale from Destiny 2.

While it might still feel like a long way off, we are rapidly approaching the release of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom on 26th September. We're so close, in fact, that the pre-order bonuses are starting to pop up.
My Nintendo Store UK has today revealed its offering and while the extra goodies and bundles might not be quite as impressive as the figurine frenzy that we saw for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, there's still a nice bit of Zelda merch that you can get your hands on.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Enjoy!

Since many gamers outside of Japan are not terribly familiar with the Densetsu no Starfy series of games (the Nintendo DS' The Legendary Starfy is the only entry so far to have been released in the West), we thought it would be fun to take a look at the history of the series, complete with some fun facts that might surprise even veteran fans.

However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium.

This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it's more a conversation about this year's early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You ever do that thing on a fairground ride or rollercoaster where you sort of pull your neck and face back in preparation for extreme motion? Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy's Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that's not true.

Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

Founded in 2019 with the signing of Terra Invicta, and led by Dallas, Texas-based chief executive officer Tim Bender and chief financial officer Snow Rui, Hooded Horse have spent the past five years grabbing up original strategy games and strategy RPGs like a smaller civ quietly steamrolling bandit fiefdoms, while larger empires like Creative Assembly and Paradox Interactive bleed each other white in the centre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New indie action JRPG Tako No Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets  - customary disclaimer: "JRPG" is a contentious term which some feel fetishises Japan culture, while others define it more neutrally as a specific style of role-playing game - is set in a world shadowed by a long-ago war between Human and Octopus. This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 FPS to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor Ultimate Doom Builder, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by gut bacteria, jar-grown rat neurons, lawnmowers, teletext, electric toothbrushes, Windows notepad (sort of), and a pregnancy test.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo's dismantling of the Switch emulator scene continued this week. Using the injunction obtained against the Yuzu emulator as a base, Nintendo has just taken down projects including Suyu, Nuzu, Uzuy, Torzu and Sudachi from GitHub. Some are likely to survive elsewhere and at least one is being completely rewritten to address various issues. Whether that will pacify Nintendo is unknown.

That's something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. 
And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

Even fantastic games like Baldur's Gate 3 suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month.

It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

Despair, ye time-constrained adults, for your carefully engineered shortage of pocket money offers no bulwark against the onslaught of games that want a slice of your evening or weekend. Today's big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this open world survival shooter, you are a "Meta-Human" making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year. 
It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Not so in cyberpunk tactics game All Walls Must Fall. Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review. Well, now it’s a bloody free time-troubling tactical shooter. Take that, Monday!

Unexpectedly, Cloudflare responded by blocking URLs on two pirate sites leading to the rarely-seen '451' error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Construct 'n' destruct sim Besiege recently got a splashy expansion in The Splintered Sea, which Nic enjoyed a lot in his review while calling it compact, small and brisk. Apparently Nic wasn't alone in this opinion: its developers now say they're working on a free update that will expand the expansion and make its campaign 50% longer.

It made me realise that, perhaps more than anything else you could say about them, weekends are for being sore. Sleeping in, waking up covered in aches, making a noise like someone three times your age when you get out of bed, and then pretending you're a third of your current age by doing nothing except play games for the next 48 hours. Here's how we'll be spending them!

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

If the Court of Justice's judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

It's also a genre I'm not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre's psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

It's been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it's rather good. We knew developers Coffee Stain were planning a 1.0 release this year. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say.

As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

That perfume bottle and lightning combo? Binned off. Everyone's favourite summon Blackknife Tiche? She's seen a certain health-regen bug fixed, so everyone's not being duped into thinking she's been heavily nerfed since the Shadow Lands sprung forth.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

Surgent doesn't explain why; it says it's focusing on supporting those affected, continuing work on Tales of Kenzera: Zau, and looking ahead to future projects. 
Here's the studio's statement, in full: 
Studio head and founder Abubakar Salim, who also voiced the titular Zau in the team's first game, released his own statement addressing the layoffs: 
Surgent Studios grows an unfortunately ever-growing list of studios affected by layoffs in 2024.

It also doesn’t work right now. But for one brief, debatably glorious day on June 29th, it did. And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer's Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


"Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them," the game's description reads. "Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
"Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It's the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers' abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron."

They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, those teases at Capcom dangled a remastered version of 2006 zombie action gem Dead Rising before the darting, entranced eyes of me specifically. The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom Next was a more succint affair this summer. It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here's a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title. 


Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become availabl…]]></summary>

I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included. But unlike me, doom scrolling on X (former…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for Game Informer's current cover story about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, game director Corinne Busche reiterates that the studio designed the game with inclusivity in mind. That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here. 
But that feeling doesn't end in the character creator. It also extends to the world – i…]]></summary>

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it's not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2's received its first major update in yonks last year, and then the nearly 17-year-old game promptly broke its concurrent player record. Still, talk to one of those players and you'll find all is not well with Valve's shooter, which is apparently regularly overrun by bots and cheaters.

Some players are now reporting "a large ban wave" targeting users of aimbots, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."


Here are the game's minimum and recommended PC specs:

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mika and The Witch's Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation's upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
