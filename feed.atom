Brighter Shores AFK XP farming guide


To AFK XP farm in Brighter Shores, you can create concoctions at the Apothecary shop or utilize a Passive Activity. The second option allows you to accumulate XP even when you're not actively playing Brighter Shores. However, if you're just starting out, the Apothecary method is a good way to get a head start, as the Passive Activity requires a significant amount of grinding to unlock.

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

There's really too much to include in such a short opening paragraph, so let's expand on things. Not only will Halo 2 fans be able to play on maps influenced by classics such as Lockout, but they'll at last experience the famed E3 2003 demo for themselves. The former comes as part of the Halo Infinite 2024 Winter Update, which adds Halo 2-inspired maps, a playlist, and armor options for the store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwing a frog (or toad) in a video game is a quick and easy way to stoke my curiosity. Have that frog skateboard on a rocket-powered wrench and you have my attention. The amphibian in question is the star of Seafrog, which developer Oh My Me Games has officially locked in for an early 2025 launch.


The mechanics immediately piqued my interest. In Seafrog, platforming is accomplished atop the aforementioned rocket-powered wrench. The game's plucky hero can grind on objects, pull off combos with pun-heavy names, and swing onto bolts for a quick mid-air repair. 


You can see a sample of how it all works in the trailer below.




As you progress through the world, you can unlock up to 24 mod chips to equip your wrench with stat boosts. There are also three Master Gears to find along with a bunch of collectible items, including 100 Snakestones, with one hidden in every room. 


It all looks very colorful, and while it's on a 2D plane for the most part, the environments and characters have a comfortably rudimentary polygonal texture to them. The bosses on display so far are appropriately screen-filling, too. 


The ultimate goal of Seafrog involves repairing derelict ships and gathering enough fuel to get your little froggy butt back to safety. It's currently in the works for PC via Steam, and if you want to see how it's shaping up for yourself you can hop on your wrench and skate right over to check out the demo.

How to plan a funeral in The Sims 4 Life and Death


First things first, a Sim must die. After that, you can click on their urn to begin planning the event. Luckily, the deceased Sim doesn’t have to be a part of the household, or even friends with your Sim, so long as their urn is nearby.


You can also set up a funeral from the calendar, by choosing a date and selecting to add a funeral event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chicken Police: Paint it Red grabbed me with its weird, photomanipulated animal-people characters, but held me there with its heart. It features a storytelling that shows a love of worldbuilding and warm characters in a noir setting. So, I’ve been greatly anticipating the follow-up, Chicken Police: Into the Hive.


It’s been given a good runway. A lot of the seeds for its events and characters had already been planted in Paint it Red, as well as the prologue side-game, Zipp’s Cafe. It was ready to be bigger and better than what came before and was poised to launch a new chapter in the Wild Gentleman’s World of Wilderness setting. Then, halfway through the game, the wheels came off of it, and now things have become more complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactically at odds with itself.
Metal Slug Tactics has felt like it has taken way too long to finally release. More than three years after its initial reveal, the game is finally here and it’s a bold but confused take on the tactics genre that has some big strengths. But, those are counterbalanced with a number of roadblocks and obstacles that often get in the way of the enjoyment you can have with it.
To start things off, this reviewer is coming at this as a turn-based tactics fan with no personal history with the Metal Slug series. When it comes to offering something for genre fans, Metal Slug Tactics succeeds, mostly. The game is actually structured as a roguelike, so you and up to two other characters you select from the Peregrine Falcons will head out and take on various, small missions in isometric grids one by one until you gain full control of an area of the map.

Where to find Secateurs in Brighter Shores


You can purchase Secateurs at the Forager's Warehouse (Old Street East) for 13 Silver and 200 Bronze. However, to unlock this option, players must reach Level 2 of their Forager Profession.

This isn't the first time we've seen the Normandy in No Man's Sky. It was first released back in 2021, marking the launch of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. This crossover makes tons of sense, so it's great to see it return.

Mass Effect's Normandy is Returning to No Man's Sky


With a trailer and a set of release notes, Hello Games confirmed that Mass Effect's Normandy SR-1 is finally back in the game to mark N7 Day. The Normandy will only be available in No Man's Sky for the next two weeks, making it yet another limited-time event for Mass Effect's iconic frigate.




Described as "a love-letter from one science fiction game to another," this No Man's Sky update comes with a revamped version of the mission released back in 2021. When completed, you'll add the Normandy to your fleet, which you can then send out on expeditions to complete. You still can't pilot it, though. Disappointing, I know.


For the rest of N7 Day, players shouldn't expect anything too exciting from BioWare. The recent release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard has already seen the studio confirm it doesn't have any huge plans for a Mass Effect announcement, so as not to distract from its most recent release. 


The wait goes on for any news about the upcoming Mass Effect title. In years gone by, N7 Day has seen multiple teasers for the next game in the series, yet it still feels as though we know very little about the game at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gold rush.
We're back with another look at the Japanese charts courtesy of Famitsu, and while you might think last week's deluge of new releases could trouble the two-time champ, you'd be wrong.
Super Mario Party Jamboree has claimed the top spot for the third week in a row, nabbing a further 57,522 copies. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven on Switch lands the silver once again, and the absence of as many newbies means that select Switch classics like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons have re-entered the fray.

"Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a pilotable version in their own space sim.
"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

You've got to hand it to No Man's Sky developer Hello Games, that team sure knows how to roll out the updates. Just weeks after the spooky 'Cursed' update landed, another patch is set to blast off today with cross-save features as its headline addition.
Starting today, Hello Games is rolling out cross-save compatibility to a select number of No Man's Sky players, so you can bring your Switch progress wherever you want to play. Now, this is an in-progress rollout, so not everyone will have access straight away. All players can now link their different accounts on the No Man's Sky cross-save website, with a small group able to select their saves from multiple devices. Hello Games says that all players will be able to do the same in "the coming weeks", so keep watching the stars.

The developer, Maxime Foulquier on X, revealed a Bloodborne remake in Unreal Engine 5 last February. The footage has since been pulled, but you can find a short clip in the thread. 


This week, they revealed that the project hadn't been worked on for over a year. Why? Well, Foulquier mentioned several reasons, saying it was "too big" and "too risky" to continue without Sony lawyers knocking down their door. So, they closed up shop on remake plans for another game that surely won't draw the lidless Eye of Sony their way. Or not. But at least it …]]></summary>

An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new open world game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

What is Scrap in PUBG


Scrap is a prime currency that you cannot find on the game's beautiful maps, simply earn as a post match reward, or even by straight-up buying it in the game's store with actual money.

A PC release followed soon after, with a Director's Cut also arriving in 2021 for PS5 and 2022 for PC.
Now, according to a report from Automaton, developer Kojima Productions has supposedly gained full control of the IP, thus significantly raising the possibility of a release on even more platforms later down the line. Perhaps even the 'Switch 2'..?

Pancake Games and Whitethorn Games have today announced that the adorable-looking "Souls-lite" Slime Heroes will be slashing its way onto Switch in early 2025.
This one will see you playing as a slime (naturally), tasked with taking on the guardian of the Fire Mountain and all of its menacing minions. To do so, you'll have to uncover an arsenal of melee weapons, upgrade your slime stats, and learn to master the dodge-rolling combat. Yep, it looks like a beginner's guide to Souls-likes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lottacoins Island in Mario & Luigi: Brothership is a unique place, not just because of its corporate culture, but also because it uses combination locks. I’ve been high and low in the game, and I’m fairly confident this is the only place that has them.


There are actually three combination locks on Lottacoins Island, but only two are actually necessary to proceed; the third is only related to an optional side quest. For all three, the intended approach is to find hints and figure out the combination based on those. You might be here because you’re stuck or are maybe just not much for puzzles and would rather just bypass the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If it ain’t Broken….
Broken Sword – Shadow of the Templars is a big deal in the world of graphic adventures. Ever since its release on PC in 1996, it has jostled for the top spot on best-ever lists around the internet. It’s landed on consoles and early mobile platforms, including a Director’s Cut that reached Wii and DS. Now, nearly three decades down the line, it’s been 'Reforged'. But does the old game underneath it all still hold up, or is this a cheap nostalgia trip?
To set the scene for anyone new to Broken Sword – or to jog the fading memories of those who played it back in the '90s – the story is about George Stobbart, an American tourist in Paris. Relaxing outside a cafe and flirting with the waitress, his sunny morning is soon blown to pieces by a clown with an explosive accordion. George can’t resist poking his nose in – especially after meeting the cynical but charming Nico, a French investigative journalist following the case. The game then rattles through an extensive cast of characters across Europe and the Middle East, unfolding a mystery entangled with the history of the medieval order of the Knights Templar.

Today, another event has arrived. Any guesses what it could be in aid of?
If the headline or giant image above hasn't already given it away, Mario & Luigi: Brothership is the latest Nintendo title to sail into the mobile app, with a brand-new event available from today until 19th December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you're saying it's a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Magic Cave is perhaps the most important location you get to visit in the Hopeforest region of Brighter Shores, and it involves you picking between one of the three available functions.


As you begin your adventure, Hopeforest will remain locked. You'll have to clear the quests in Hopeport before you can make your journey to the second region. Entering the Magic Cave will allow you to pick the faction you want, but before that, you'll need to know where to find it in the first place.


How to go to Magic Cave in Brighter Shores


While opening the Magic Cave is relatively easy, reaching it will take you at least a few hours. Episode 1 must be complete, as you'll need access to the Hopeforest region.



Once you reach Hopeforest, search for all your companions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A name might not have much value in Brighter Shores, as it certainly won't help you to clear out the contents or grind quicker.


But still, Brighter Shores is a game best enjoyed with your friends, and having a cool name could have a special value. When picking a name for the first time, you might not have put much thought behind typing a few letters. Thankfully, there's a way to rectify and change your name if you're not satisfied with what you used the first time.


Brighter Shores name change explained


While you can change your name in Brighter Shores, the method is limited in the sense that you can't use the feature if you're free to play. The ability to change name is available only to those who have an active subscription to the Premium Pass.


If you have already subscribed to the Premium Pass, you can use the Rename feature to choose a new name. This can also be done later with the help of Eric Inkwell, who can be found at Crenopolis.

Access to the Premium Pass offers even more customization options. Free-to-play users have no way of using unique names, and they will always have a suffix at the end of their title. Unique names can't have a duplicate inside the game, which makes your title feel unique.


Do note that the ability to change your name will be available as a pop-up the first time you log into the game after subscribing to the Premium Pass. You'll be able to change it again from Eric Inkwell once you've unlocked Crenopolis and the quests of that region. You'll always need an active membership to the Premium Pass for this function.


The Premium Pass also offers plenty of extra gameplay content, as it unlocks two extra regions - Mine of Mantuban and Crenopolis. The regions come with their own places of interest, professions, and more. If you're still unsure about buying the Premium pass, make sure to check out our review of the microtransaction and its offerings.

How to play with friends in Brighter Shores


To add friends in Brighter Shores, you must unlock the Level Up quest in the Main Story. This part of the narrative involves the game's tutorial stages, requiring you to find Delana's Bow, defeat goblins, and craft some potions. Once you've completed these steps in Hopeport, you'll gain access to the Privacy Settings. Changing these specs is crucial, as it can lock you out of specific co-op features.

It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

Despite releasing just a year after its predecessor, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky makes significant changes to the formula of GSC Game World’s venerable series. There are tweaked visuals, improved shooting, and some added systems crammed into this prequel. As a result, it feels markedly different to Shadow of Chornobyl, but not always in a good way. The shift in focus to faction conflict de-emphasises the persistent atmosphere of dread that permeated the first game.
You fill the irradiated boots of Scar, a Stalker with a mysterious condition that allows him to survive the Zone's emissions. Rescued from such an event by research group Clear Sky, he is tasked with tracking down a group of Stalkers as a means of repayment. These rogue mercenaries have designs on reaching the secrets at the centre of the Zone… and one of their number is our old friend Strelok.

As a part of its recent Corporate Management Policy Briefing for FY2025, Nintendo has reiterated its stance on mergers and acquisitions. Namely, while future acquisitions are never off the table, it would rather "organically expand the organisation".

Last month's excellent 'Ode to Castlevania' DLC has got us diving into Poncle's beautiful bullet hell, Vampire Survivors, all over again. We've been having such a good time with the latest expansion that we'd be perfectly happy to see waves of DLC added to this one for years to come, but naturally, Poncle may one day want to move on to a new project. And yet, whatever comes next, it seems we shouldn't expect it to blow the current project's scope out of the water.

Ukrainian developer Bear Games has revealed Comix Zero, a non-linear action-platformer that takes place within the pages of a comic book, with its fast-paced gameplay taking inspiration from the likes of Super Metroid and Elden Ring.
Now, if the name and premise sound somewhat familiar, it's likely because Bear Games has also leaned heavily on the classic Mega Drive / Genesis title Comix Zone for inspiration. In fact, the studio even goes to far as to christen its new title as a 'comixvania' (excuse us, we feel a bit ill).

Nintendo has released its Q&A transcription for the recent financial briefing, and it contains a rather humorous interaction between an investor and legendary creator Shigeru Miyamoto in which the former calls Miyamoto a "genius". To his face.
Naturally, given Miyamoto's tendency to view his accomplishments with a humble attitude, he was quick to dispute such a lofty label. Although the Google translation for the Q&A may be a bit iffy (an officially translation will likely land later this week), he essentially notes how employees who listen to his annual company lecture are surprised at how "normal" he really is.

I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baví vás elektronika, informační technologie, bastlení nebo obecně technika? Pak i tento měsíc je tady pro Vás Virtuální Bastlírna - online setkání hospodského typu všech nadšenců do techniky, organizované projektem MacGyver strahovského studentského klubu SiliconHill.

Pokud by se diskuze náhodou zadrhla, mají Strahováci nachystaná i výplňová témata. Například co se stalo za katastrofy poslední měsíc? Voyager 1 musel kvůli poruše přejít z rychlé komunikace na pásmu X na pomalejší pásmo S. A na neocenitelný WebArchive šlo několik kybernetických útoků, které způsobily nejen výpadek ukládání nových stránek, ale i jeho kompletní nedostupnost.

Ale dost o katastrofách - co za nové projekty se vynořilo? Objevil se nový projekt kompletně 3D tištěného počítače Ondra. Také se našel šikula, který byl schopný rozebrat komunikaci s levnou čínskou termokamerou a získat tak mnohem lepší obrázky. A firma Mosaic uveřejnila patnáctiterapixelový soubor 3D scanů a 360 stupňových obrázků Prahy.

Z kuriozit se pak nabízí modifikace chytrých baterií firmy Parkside pro kompatibilitu se sítí FindMyIphone, Linux nabootovaný na procesoru Intel 4004 (s malým trikem) a nebo výroba největšího digitronu na světě (v České republice)! 

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone in a xeet.

Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon's Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

        <updated>2024-11-05T22:23:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discourse? Look mate, I’m just here to test the Steam Deck. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s tempting to frame Straftat as a throwback to an older, better time for the multiplayer FPS, when the lingo was coded in frags and gibs and sucking it down, when satisfaction was drawn entirely from performance rather than some convoluted, artificial system of progression. Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s plenty that you could justifiably expect from a Bioware RPG: chats with mates, opportunities to get those mates horribly killed, surviving mates turning to the side then walking offscreen. But I don’t think anyone expected Dragon Age: The Veilguard to be, at least on a purely technical level, one of the smoothest-performing, settings-rich AAA PC releases of the year so far.

By which I mean, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta is now live on Steam through to 4th November at 2.59am GMT. That's 2.59am sharp. If you're hurrying along at 3am on Monday absolutely desperate to polish the aesthetics of a small enslaved catperson, you can sod off and play Dragon Age: The Veilguard instead.

Speaking as somebody who would quite like there to be more Alan Wake games - or at least, moderately weird and pretty decent blockbuster singleplayer horror games - I am both pleased by this news and a little troubled that Remedy's eldritch forest fable (which came out in October 2023) has yet to break even.

What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie action game Showa American Story is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:

I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for Apex Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy RPG studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter Prey (2017) studio Arkane Austin - alongside a handful of others - back in May.
Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.

With over a quarter billion visits in the last 12 months alone, Livehd7 is a significant operation, but  news of its demise may provoke déjà vu. In September 2023, ACE said that in collaboration with Egypt's Ministry of Justice, the operator of Livehd7 had been arrested, and the network shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

I never finished it because my Xbox 360 version was not, in practice, an open world game, but a lonely farm at the bottom of a vortex of butchered spacetime. In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be inelegant. It's far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.

Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am once again asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you Ian Games for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy can be thin, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: "Nazis? I hate these guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting!

I've already written our review for Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, in which I celebrated the touching moments of Max's return to the series, and lamented the clunky plot that she finds herself in. In this adventure game, you're looking into the killing of a close friend, shot by an unknown assailant. You hop between two dimensions to solve the case - one world in which your pal still lives and the other in which she's dead. Unfortunately for the murder victim, you play a bona fide hot mess who could not perform a cross examination if she were standing in front of a crucifix with a magnifying glass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at "ancient history" for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 quality assurance staff from Eden Prarie, Minnesota have walked out in protest over Activision's ending of hybrid or remote working, which was announced in December last year. They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who claim that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they announced in 2023. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.

Shueisha's goal is to obtain enough information on these currently anonymous individuals so that it can file lawsuits against them in Japan. A DMCA subpoena obtained earlier against Cloudflare appears to have provided plenty of fresh leads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Remains Of Edith Finch is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

Unfortunately for Bl6ps, and for us, that technical success is balanced on the knife tip of some seriously overwrought infrastructure. Mainly in the form the UX nightmare that is the Call of Duty HQ launcher, as well as a meddlesome always-online requirement, itself serving a feature that doesn’t even work that well.

But the word "ambivalent" already exists. So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM's Global Main Menu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Není to kvalitní film, ale je šílený a není nudný ani rutinní. Je to výpověď o tom, co si Coppola na stará kolena myslí o světě a o filmařině - a taková výpověď mě zajímá.

Kdyby mu bylo 10 nebo 12 let, už bych mu nepouštěl tohle, ale první Bayovy Transformers. Je to fajn, ale je to opravdu jen a pouze pro děti. A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
