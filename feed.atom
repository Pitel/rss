        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far bet it from me to complain about Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The London Case introducing more incongruous eye candy, after my previous conniptions over Hot Hipster Poirot with his ankle-grazer trousers and his sexy egg-shaped head, but tick tock, it's himbo Hastings o'clock. Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).
Technically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.
"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out'," Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. "In fact, it was the opposite," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was "who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's "creative sequel" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the "what if" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.

If you owned a Sega Genesis growing up, you probably know that a co-op Sonic game is a bad idea. Sonic runs too fast, the screen moves too quickly, and player two often gets lost off-screen. So when I learned the upcoming Sonic Superstars would offer a multiplayer sidescrolling Sonic experience, I couldn’t help but scratch my head. Sure, our own Eric “the Hedgehog” Van Allen covered this already, so I knew the game was already toying with some 2D Sonic fundamentals. But the how and why of a Sonic Superstars co-op mode continued to eat at me. How could a game like this ever work?
Fortunately, during a recent event held by Sega, I was able to sit down with a demo of Sonic Superstars that let players get into the trenches…]]></summary>

Some of the heaviest hitters of 2023 are lengthy RPG journeys that advertise dozens upon dozens of hours of questing and storytelling. So it's nice when a game like Sea of Stars lets me hang up my adventurer's hat for a little bit of fishing.
I'm only a few hours into Sea of Stars, which is out today on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It's a chill, interesting RPG that definitely has some love for the golden oldies, but also has some neat ideas of its own. Not surprising, given its the team that made a similar retro-modern fusion in The Messenger.

These slapstick delights made it a cult classic, but rights-holders Ubisoft haven't done much with the game since.

Now a group of modders have been given a "completely blank check" by Ubisoft to do what they want with their efforts to build a modding SDK for the nearly 20-year-old game, and their ambitions include co-op and raytracing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samba De Amigo: Party Central is out now, to the rejoice of anyone craving a Latin-themed music game. The original game produced by Yuji Naka received several ports since its 1999 release, but this marks the first proper sequel since then.
Party Central launched with an exciting and colorful trailer featuring its cast dancing to Mr. Worldwide. It's a stylistic choice I approve of, as a Miami native.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9j1maxNVs8
Beyond marking the revival of a classic franchise, Samba De Amigo: Party Central fills a hole for more stylized rhythm games. Anyone wanting to bust a move while at home was pretty much stuck to the Just Dance games, so this will be refreshing to anyone wanting something different.
Something odd about this release is its chosen platforms. Nintendo Switch is unsurprising due to the type of game this is, but it's also coming to Apple Arcade as Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go. It looks like it'll be fun regardless, and will likely appeal to many casual players with the subscription. A VR Samba de Amigo is also expected sometime later this year.
Multiplayer is the highlighted feature in the trailer, but there is also a story mode. Given the musically whimsical nature, it looks like a light-hearted adventure featuring protagonist Amigo and friends.
While Samba De Amigo: Party Central looks like a blast, the game lacks one of the original's iconic features. Something that made it special was the special maracas players used to follow the beats, but Joy-Cons and touch controls have seemingly made them outdated.
Still, it's good news for Sega fans and rhythm game fans. Assuming it lives up to the original game, Party Central can hopefully be a wonderful revival of a classic franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WayForward announced a major addition to River City Girls 2 with the launch of a four-player online mode. Beat 'em up fans have been brawling with up to three friends locally for a while, but now online co-op extends to four players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. 
This follows some recent patches that have been put in place to improve balance and performance. Animation was increased to 60FPS on PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC along with upgraded Switch performance. Combos and juggles have also been adjusted for a more user-friendly experience. Those who already traversed the mean streets from end to end can continue to do so with repeat playthroughs of New Game+.

Return to River City
To get everyone up to speed on the series, WayForward shared a River City Girls series trailer. The games flip the script on the River City Ransom story, this time tasking Misako and Kyoko with rescuing their kidnapped boyfriends. The sequel ups the stakes and has our heroes brawling with the yakuza to take the city back. It's all set to lively pixel art visuals and a scorching soundtrack by Megan McDuffee. The Sean "Jacksepticeye" McLoughlin-voiced Godai narrates the overview below.

After the first game's 2019 debut, River City Girls 2 made its way to consoles and PC in December 2022. As as a spinoff to the Kunio-kun / River City Ransom series, WayForward carved a nice little niche of its own. If you're looking to get into the series, WayForward introduced new digital bundles that pack in all three games. River City Girls, River City Girls 2, and River City Girls Zero are all included for a $74.99 bundle price.

I have about another 300 hours before I know what the heck they’re talking about, but apparently, some people have beef with the way Larian ended the character arcs for certain beloved party members in Baldur’s Gate 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gameplay trailer for the hand-drawn horror game Bye Sweet Carole has made its online debut, showing off its classic animated film-inspired visuals. Publisher Just For Games and developer Little Sewing Machine first announced the "thrilling horror adventure" back in April. Following a cinematic reveal trailer in June, the first gameplay preview was showcased behind closed doors at last week's Gamescom event. Now the rest of us can see how the visuals carry over to the adventure-style gameplay. 
As the trailer notes, footage comes from a "very early" pre-alpha version of the game. Complete voice acting (in Italian and English) and other final assets will be added later. I'm getting some real Clock Tower vibes from the footage so far.

Timeless inspirations 
Bye Sweet Carole comes from Remothered creator Chris Darril. Much like Studio MDHR's Cuphead, the developers behind it took inspiration from cartoons of the past. Instead of citing specific films, they simply give a nod to "the greatest animation movies." Feel free to fill in the blank with your own personal favorites. There's definitely a classic Disney / Don Bluth aesthetic to it all.

The story finds Lana Benton trailing Carole Simmons, who previously escaped 19th century orphanage Bunny Hall. True to its name, a colony of wild rabbits has taken over, all with the power to open a portal to the world of Corolla. Don't feel left out of this lagomorph legend, though, because you'll also be able to transform into a bunny. 
Bye Sweet Carole is currently in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Don't mark your calendars just yet, because it won't be ready until sometime in 2024.

Capturing the imagination space of the tabletop and transforming it into a single-player, highly produced and catered experience is a dream that can seem a little unattainable. But Baldur’s Gate 3 gets pretty damn close.
Baldur’s Gate 3 is the third game in a series of Dungeons & Dragons RPGs originally made by BioWare; but just as importantly, it’s the latest game from Larian Studios, hot off a winning streak with Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2.
As has already been discussed to death, plenty of individual factors account for Baldur’s Gate 3 success: the established development history of Larian, years of relative freedom in development and Early Access, the surging popularity of tabletop role-playing …]]></summary>

But what exactly is Thank Goodness You're Here!? Well, having played through one of its 15 minute missions now, I can tell you it's a bit like Untitled Goose Game, in that you have a village you can wander about in causing chaos, but it's also much more structured than that, with specific quests and people to help as you guide your tiny travelling salesman through its surreal neighbourhood.

Lenny didn't exactly unequip his weapons, because they're forced onto your AC unit. Still, he found out that he could simply not use them and charge into his enemies instead, as that also provides a reliable damage output. Naturally, punching doesn't use ammunition, but that doesn't mean ZeroLenny came across an infinite source of damage. This is a …]]></summary>

It wasn't necessarily a moment exclusive to this difficulty setting, but having what should've been an easy kill lead to a character's death made me rethink how I approached battles going forward.
Generally, Baldur's Gate 3 is a challenge on whatever setting you pick, but Tactician Mode is brutal. The setting forces players into a new mindset: Fully take advantage of all the systems BG3 offers, or die. Honestly, it's amazing how different the game feels with the difficulty spike, and I love it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, news of a malicious Genshin Impact hack began circulating around social media. Through use of third-party plugins, bad actors could abuse a Kaveh ability in Genshin Impact to explode Dendro Cores and delete any interactable entity in the overworld. The situation is now resolved, with the developer HoYoverse making a statement that the issues have been fixed and perpetrators have been banned.
Before the official statement though, there was a period of confusion and uncertainty among players. Some panicked. Others responded with memes. Here’s some of the best creative content that was produced during the ordeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To say that the Starfield community is excited about the game's early access release on September 1 would be a severe understatement. The game is now at the top of Steam charts, for one, and even though an odd leak here and there may have tried to throw a wrench in the hype, it doesn't seem like there's a way for this train to stop before it reaches its inevitable destination. It's not too surprising, then, that some community members have patched together an impromptu pre-release Starfield character planner to let fans theory craft away while they wait.
It's not an awfully long wait until Starfield comes out, granted, but the fact of the matter is that this is Bethesda Game Studios' next big sandbox RPG. A certain amount of pre-release hype was to be expected.

It was an extremely influential game, and it’s still very entertaining to play today, but it was a pioneer on ground that has since become well-trodden. Typically, this sort of game that was important but largely superseded would be found in one of any number of game collections. But The Making of Karateka is not that.
Sure, you don’t just get Karateka. You also get a number of ports, prototypes, a full remaster, and a remastered prototype. But the focus is clearly on the marquee title.

After opening its doors in 2017, Ubisoft Bordeaux has worked mainly as a support studio to others in the Ubisoft umbrella.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forever Entertainment has announced that they’ve bolted in a firm release date for their Front Mission 2 remake. It will be coming to Switch on October 5.
Front Mission 2 was originally supposed to be released back in June 12, 2023, but was delayed. I took that devastating news with dignity and a stiff upper lip and only cried a lot. At the time, Forever Entertainment said that they wanted an additional window to cram as many features into it as possible.
https://youtu.be/8VeqGrxGaR4?feature=shared
Originally released on PS1 in 1997, this remake will be the first time that Front Mission 2 has graced our shores. Forever Entertainment is currently in the process of remaking the first three games in the series, but here’s hoping that they don’t stop there.
The first Front Mission was already remade as Front Mission 1st (remake) and released last November. It’s not the greatest game, but I loved the heck out of it and appreciate the effort taken to localize them. Coincidentally, I just bought and started the PC version of it yesterday. One of my complaints about the Switch version was its technical deficiencies, so I’ve been waiting for a good chance to grab a port on a more powerful console.
However, I won’t be waiting when it comes to Front Mission 2. I’ll be grabbing it when it drops on Switch October 5, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not just another cog.
Back when Trine 4 came out, it felt a bit like a hail-mary attempt to recapture the audience that was lost after the disappointment of Trine 3, and the future of the series seemed a bit up in the air. Luckily, that last title proved to be a strong return to form for the series, and after a DLC expansion (on PC) that was also well-received, Frozenbyte was able to justify greenlighting a full-fledged sequel in the 2.5D tradition. Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy certainly doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it proves beyond any doubt that the developers still have a lot of great ideas to explore and it stands as yet another high-quality entry in the ongoing series.
Trine 5 once again follows the exploits of Amadeus the Wizard, Zoya the Thief, and Pontius the Knight who are now quite famous in their world for saving the day many times. The heroes are reunited after being summoned by Lady Sunny for a celebration ceremony to commemorate their achievements. However, upon arrival, the regent quickly reveals her true colors and attempts to steal the heroes’ power from them, aided by an army of clockwork knights built by Lord Godric. Our heroes manage to escape in time, and this kicks off a quest to defeat the elusive and power-hungry Lady Sunny before she seizes control of the kingdom.

Beginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET the Direct will run for about 15 minutes and, hopefully, peel the curtain back on Wonder’s new features and power-ups. The game's biggest change centers on the Wonder Flower, which transforms stages into trippy versions of themselves laden with mind-bending effects. More than anything, however, we’re excited to see more of Mario's new elephant transformation as well as the elephant versions of his friends.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the next 2D sidescroller in the legendary franchise. Mario is joined by Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy in an adventure that can be enjoyed with up to four players. The game is slated to launch on Switch on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["What's better than gazing at the Milky Way?", asks Bethesda. The answer? "Savouring it as well." That's right folks, I may not have laid my hands on big Todd's mega RPG Starfield, but I've actually tasted its universe, in the form of a promotional drink handed out at Gamescom. It’s composed of cinnamon and stardust, with the boundless expanse of space taking on the form of a grey liquid goop. I’ve got to admit, I think it makes for an excellent beverage, and could perhaps have elicited more excitement from me than the game itself will on release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced via Twitter that there’s a Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Direct stream slated for August 31 at 7am PT/10am ET.
The stream is scheduled to be about 15 minutes, so it’s unlikely that they’re going to really dive into much else. That said, I’m sure people are still going to be hoping for a “just one more thing” reveal.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1696523235138158892?s=20
On the other hand, we don’t know a whole lot about Super Mario Bros. Wonder aside from the fact that Mario’s mushroom habit has gotten worse, and he also has yet another fursona; this one of an elephant. Hopefully, this stream will clear up any lingering questions, like maybe who’s taking over the voice duties for Charles Martinet. At least we won’t have to wait long to find out.
The Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct stream is scheduled for August 31, 2023 at 7am PT/10am ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you step out into the plains of Fallout 4, what do you see? A derelict city, a bunch of raiders, and some mutated beasts. It's all very fine, but one modder decided that the post-apocalyptic RPG needed an injection of some added flora and fauna.
Over on Nexus Mods (as spotted by DSO Gaming), user StamperDoesMods has created "Mutant Menagerie - Life Finds a Way," a mod for Fallout 4 that adds a ton of new wildlife as well as plant life. According to the description, The Commonwealth is now crawling with more than 60 new mutants, over 30 new herbs and plants, and around 50 new species of fish.
https://youtu.be/4bIR1BVoJOE?t=122
It's a veritable Garden of Eden, if said garden had been annihilated by an atomic explosion. The mod also allows you to "earn new perks through gameplay, craft hundreds of new recipes and workshop objects, and much MUCH more!"
Life...uh...uh...uh...
The images on Nexus Mods–as well as the above video–give a brief overview of what you can expect from "Mutant Menagerie." The fact that it contains so much new content should keep any dystopian-loving wannabee David Attenborough entertained for a while.
Fallout 4 is already pretty full of dangerous creatures, so a few more won't hurt. It's safe to assume that not all of these news ones are hostile, which means there'll be opportunities to just take in what remains of nature. Not to mention a chance to do some fishing. So...Fallout meets Stardew Valley, then?
You never know what you're going to get from the modding community. There are so many ways to tweak games like Fallout 4 that it's little wonder people are still playing years after release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to "-gate" status, with "Tilegate" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing "dreamable" space sim Noctis. 


Who knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The amount of hype for Starfield easily rivals the biggest games of this year, which is really saying something. In fact, the anticipation is so enormous that Bethesda's upcoming sci-fi RPG is already topping the Steam charts.
If you head over to the website, you'll see that – at the time of writing – Starfield is currently at the number two spot on Steam's "Top Sellers" list. The only thing beating it is Valve's own Steam Deck device, which means the upcoming sci-fi RPG is number one in terms of actual games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek3I6_9c58E&pp=ygUdc3RhcmZpZWxkIGxpdmUgYWN0aW9uIHRyYWlsZXI%3D
Anybody who's even skimmed video game news lately could probably expect this development. Microsoft even reduced and then removed the Game Pass trial just ahead of the game's release, presumably to prevent eager people trying to play it on the cheap.
How it is at the top when it's not even out yet?
Some may wonder how an unreleased game can dominate a chart that measures sales. However, it's likely that Steam is taking into account pre-orders.
A quick look over on SteamDB shows that Starfield has approximately 342,000 owners and is the number one wishlisted game. To clarify, the information on the number of owners/players comes from PlayTracker, which does clarify that this insight is "90% certain that estimates for this game are accurate within a 27% interval".
In any case, Bethesda's upcoming title will inevitably continue to be a hot topic of discussion in the foreseeable future. We're still a week away from its release, so get used to seeing Starfield absolutely everywhere soon.
Starfield is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6. It'll also be available on Game Pass.

Now, the publisher has announced that the game will be blasting onto Switch on 5th October 2023 (via Gematsu).
Front Mission 2: Remake is exactly what it sounds like — a remake of the 1997 strategy RPG for the PlayStation. What makes this second remake more interesting than the first is that this entry has never been officially localised in English before, meaning this will be the first time many will be able to suit up in their wazner in the sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that they have a new entry in one of the oldest video game franchises around. Qomp2 is an upcoming game developed by Graphite Labs, and is the sequel to the shortform 2021 indie game, Qomp. It’s scheduled to hit PC, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2024.
Qomp was a spiritual success to 1972’s Pong, which is a game I probably don’t need to explain. Qomp is said to be the answer to the question, “What would happen if the pong ball escaped the paddles?” Well, I already know the answer to that. A point would be counted for the opposite side. It’s the point of the game.
If it was up to me, the ball would break out into the real world and discover that it has to get a job to afford to live. Then, it would struggle with a dead-end job, bills, loneliness, and an uncaring society. It would yearn to return to the Pong playing field.
https://youtu.be/tah154H6i1o?feature=shared
Emotions about balls
However, in Qomp’s universe, the ball goes on an adventure through a deadly, minimalistic labyrinth. Minimalistic is pretty much the defining word here, as the challenges and movement are all based on a single button that changes the direction of the ball. It was also a short game, but it got some modest acclaim.
Qomp2 is bringing a second button to the input table. This one is a dash, and dashes make everything better. It promises “an enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly with simple animations, effects, and the game mechanics themselves.” That sounds like an indie game, yeah. Interestingly, though, I’m not sure if the original developers are involved. The first Qomp was a group of indie devs united by Stuffed Wombat, but the sequel is being done by frequent Atari collaborator Graphite Labs.
Qomp 2 will release on PC, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink has been on my most anticipated games list for two-years, with all of my anticipation based purely off bitty trailers that haven't revealed anything other than its flashy action RPG combat and deeply anime towns. So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.
Blazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Going through the motion controls.
In the Wii's heyday, some executive or other higher-up at Nintendo dove into the multitude of factors that converged to make the Wii such a resounding success. Among the factors was the idea that motion—even at a minuscule level, like flicking one's wrist—was tied to the brain's production of dopamine. Pairing that concept with the dazzling chimes and flashing lights of a video game intensified that sensation and added a deepened sense of interactivity.
Flicking your wrist to swing a tennis racket in Wii Sports felt so good—and continues to 'hit different' today in Nintendo Switch Sports. Sure, the novelty's worn off a bit, but there's no denying that it just feels right. While VR has carved out a niche for itself as the new home for motion-controlled games, the Switch Joy-Con controllers still make a good host for the occasional motion-fueled jaunt. Unfortunately, Samba de Amigo: Party Central, the first true sequel to the original 1999 Dreamcast maraca-shaking game, doesn't use them particularly well. This is where the vast majority of Party Central's biggest issues stem from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampires might be the themed threat for Diablo 4's second season, but it was arguably its own player base who drew first blood when season one started at the end of July. As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as "a perfect storm of a couple of situations" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. 
"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again," says Fergusson. "As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the first derelict and/or abandoned (but is it really abandoned???) spaceship you ever visited in a videogame? I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. 


Does Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile "Legendary" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about "the tragedies and perils of space travel".

Nintendo's Switch has just achieved another sales milestone. Although worldwide hardware sales of the hybrid system surpassed Wii sales some time ago, there's been an update in the US.
According to new data from Circana (previously the NPD), US lifetime sales of Switch hardware have "finally" overtaken the Wii. After six years on the market, the hybrid system achieved this feat in July 2023. No exact sales data was provided, but IGN notes that "49 million were sold in the Americas".

As a decades-long fan of pro wrestling and RPGs, WrestleQuest is my dream premise. A game that distills the best traits of classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI and injects them with a hefty dose of sports entertainment? Sign me up. However, what begins as a great idea on paper falls apart thanks to a botched execution that sees the game stepping on rakes any time it tries to pick up momentum.

But which of those was good? Which of them was bad? Why is 2023's Lightfall sitting at an 'Overwhelmingly Negative' review rating on Steam? And why did the game lose massive batches of content in the years prior? One thing is for sure: Destiny 2's history is remarkably complex and storied, and this article aims to look at it with a specific objective in mind: ranking all Destiny 2 expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has shown off some spiffy-looking pictures of the classic Living Forest level as it will appear in Mortal Kombat 1. Oh, gosh. I really hate the naming scheme of these games. At least the level looks great.
The Living Forest first appeared in 1993’s Mortal Kombat II. It’s one of the game’s most memorable locations. Not only is it haunting and surreal, visibly demonstrating the dark hazards of Outworld, but you could also catch a glimpse of secret characters Smoke and Jade peaking from behind the haunted trees.
Since then, it has been a staple of the series, reappearing every few games to eat a few more Kombatants. The last we saw it in its full glory was in Mortal Kombat (2011). It appears that in Mortal Kombat 1 we'll be seeing two sides of the famous flora. The first side is the normal Living Forest. During the daytime, it actually looks pretty peaceful. Full of life and foliage. No doubt, it's benefited from Liu Kang's vision of a more peaceful universe.
[caption id="attachment_399606" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via NetherRealm[/caption]
But then there's the other side: the Corrupted Forest. There’s green fire for some reason. The trees are all skull-like. But I think the nicest touch is that the undergrowth has lost all its leaves, so you have these skeletal shrubs jutting out on all sides. NetherRealm's Twitter post seems to suggest this part of the woods has been twisted by dark magic that has interrupted the slumber of the haunted trees.
I definitely dig the dichotomy of the slumbering Living Forest and the dangerous-looking Corrupted Forest. One looks like a nice place for a walk, and the other looks like it will wreak havoc on your shins.
Mortal Kombat 1 comes out September 19, 2023 to PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.

We've given this list a fresh end-of-summer update with many stunning-looking games, including the gorgeous 16-bit inspired Sea of Stars.

While the Switch might not be able to compete with other platforms in pure processing terms, there's certainly no shortage of beautiful-looking games on the console. Switch may not output at a native 4K at 120 fps, but Nintendo diminutive little hybrid can still pack a punch for the eyeballs. Couple clever programming with excellent art direction and Switch can deliver stunning visuals on a little console you can throw in a backpack. How far we've come since the Game Boy days!

        <updated>2023-08-28T16:54:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is almost here. Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. 


Here are the PC specifications for Starfield: 
Minimum: 
OS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti
DirectX: Version 12
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
Recommended: 
OS: Windows 10/11 with updates
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080
DirectX: Version 12
Network: Broadband Internet connection
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
As you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. 
Starfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. 
While waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. 
Are you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many attempts have been made to recapture the JRPG's glory days. In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's "HD-2D" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep one hand on your wallet because Analogue is coming around with a special, glow-in-the-dark edition of their Analogue Pocket. This radiant version of the beefed-up Game Boy goes on sale on September 1st. There is no pre-order period, so you can expect it to ship by September 5th.
The Analogue Pocket is Analogue’s take on portable handhelds. It uses FPGA to create a hardware environment close to the Game Boy line of handhelds. There are also a number of adapters available that let you play games from other consoles, like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear. It also has various display modes to bring you closer to the original platforms without having to deal with all their warts.
[caption id="attachment_399525" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Analogue[/caption]
It’s a pretty slick enthusiast-level device. I’m a bit envious since it’s sort of out of my price range. Also, I don’t really play handheld games that much, even though I’ve got a rather substantial library of titles. Still, if I had one, it would get used.
The glow-in-the-dark luxury edition is exactly that. The shell has been made of glow-in-the-dark plastic. It gets charged via available light sources and can apparently continuously glow for 8 hours, just like those plastic stars you have all over your bedroom ceiling. That’s all you get in terms of special features, which I feel is to be expected.
The Analogue Pocket Glow-in-the-Dark Limited edition will be available in “highly limited” numbers. It goes on sale September 1st at 8 am PDT for $249.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arleen Sorkin, veteran actress and the original voice and inspiration behind the popular DC character Harley Quinn, has passed away. She was 67.
The news was announced last night. Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance. Her now-iconic portrayal of Harley Quinn resonated with fans, and she became the breakout character of the show. Harley…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Starfield isn't out yet, there's been so much content and sneak previews for the game that some people are trying to piece it together ahead of schedule. For example, one person has decided to recreate an outpost styled after the upcoming sci-fi RPG in something other than Bethesda's in-house engine.
As spotted by DSO Gaming, YouTuber Ghost Design recently uploaded footage from an Unreal Engine 5 project they've been working on. Spanning seven minutes, the footage shows what a typical Starfield outpost looks like when rendered in this software.
https://youtu.be/Q67J3Aw_GEM
Using the free "Mission to Minerva" pack, Ghost Design has created what is essentially a facsimile of something that looks like it could be from Starfield itself. Only it's done in Unreal rather than Creation Engine.
Imagine the whole game in Unreal
UE5 is currently one of (if not the) most powerful accessible game engines in the world. It's also one of the most popular, more so by the fact that any developer, big or small, can make use of it. Conversely, Bethesda's Creation Engine is proprietary, so only Bethesda games get made with it.
While the use of Creation Engine for Starfield has likely drawn some criticism given how old it is, it's worth remembering that this is version 2.0. The studio has allegedly overhauled the software, bringing it more up-to-date, so games made it in should hopefully not have that Skyrim jank to them. From what we've all seen so far, it's fair to say that Starfield does look pretty. It's likely that official footage has been captured on PC using the most modern hardware around, so we'll see whether it looks as nice on a mid-range system or the Xbox Series S.
Starfield will be releasing on September 6 for Series X|S and PC.

Sea of Stars is like a great genre film by a skilled director. It looks and feels familiar; you basically know what to expect and can probably even predict the major beats, but it doesn’t hinder the experience. The intention is so well-executed that I was eager to soak it all in and, in this case, swim in the stars. I dreaded Sea of Stars’ conclusion not because I feared the worst but because I didn’t want to leave the world and stop playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But you know. In a good way. My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.
I may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like Warframe, Digital Extremes’ shockingly enduring free-to-play action RPG, but I do find its sci-fantasy direction a bit much. The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. 
The Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, Tenno! This message comes to you from that primeval epoch known as "Last Wednesday", when Digital Extremes treated RPS to a preview screening of the Warframe update announcements planned for this year's Tennocon - a special Tennocon indeed, coinciding as it does with the game's 10th anniversary and the studio's 30th. Alas, "Last Wednesday" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, "Today" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency. Fickle are the winds of history! Still, even with the limited insight of our time, we grasped at some sense of the offering's magnitude. Read on, if you dare.

Some criticism also fell upon its four classes, who lacked the 'career' subclasses of its developer's previous game, Vermintide 2.

Darktide's classes will therefore get an overhaul October 4th, when an update will introduce skill trees for each class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 will feature a familiar face in actor Shawn Ashmore. While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. 
Ashmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. 
The brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx
August 25, 2023
“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment," says Ashmore in the video. "Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will."
Alan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest. You can watch the latest trailer from Gamescom 2023 here and read our impressions of a Summer Game Fest demo featuring Saga here.]]></summary>

The downside of such a bounty is there are even more gems getting overlooked than usual, because nobody has the time even when we're aware of them. Like, for example, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

It absolutely is the Jet Set Radio tribute it looks like, and it's a delight even if, like me, you never really liked the originals. Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consistent with the spirit of the game, Baldur’s Gate 3’s first “major” patch notes are too large to even fit into Steam’s usual text character limit. Developer Larian instead published a portion of the patch details on a Steam blog and the rest on their forums, which were briefly  down - probably either due to an online traffic jam or just, again, the patch’s sheer size. Regardless, we have well over three thousand words worth of details on today’s patch, which addresses around one thousand bugs and graces us with “Short King Summer” before it’s too late. But beware: there are some spoilers in the patch notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco have announced a substantial 2.0 patch and the first DLC pack for their rollercoaster management game Park Beyond, both of which are dropping on September 29th. Prefabs and ride sharing are the big new additions coming with the free 2.0 patch, alongside the option to discover other player’s creations across platforms. Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.
The game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.

That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.
Maybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.

While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.

That vampire is named Kado Thorne and he’s made the battle island his home in Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4. He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. 

Epic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards. And inside, you’ll find Thorne has filled them with …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Jump Over The Age revealed Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, a sequel that occurs “some time” after last year’s Citizen Sleeper. Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. 
The game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: 


“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” 
This sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” 

If you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. 
There’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. 
In the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has been perhaps the biggest surprise hit of 2023 – we gave it one of the highest scores of the year – although Early Access players have been singing the RPG’s praises for a while now. It launched on PC earlier this month and is due on PlayStation 5 next month. Earlier this summer, Larian said it wants to launch Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox this year but might push into 2024 due to parity issues between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.

My approach to games is pretty unruly is what I’m trying to say, but there has been one game that tamed my rampaging ways and that was Cappybara Games’ Below.
Below is a game that’s best played slowly. You’re tasked with reaching the bottom of an island’s subterranean caverns, trying to survive against monsters, traps, starvation, and dehydration. Each layer is shrouded in darkness meaning that you only have the small ring of light from your torch to watch carefully where you step. Charging through these levels is the quickest way of getting sliced and diced, and when you die, you begin back on the beach right next to the boat you arrived on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is a meditative climbing adventure by Life is Strange developer Don't Nod. First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.
The game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. 
Web of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. 


If that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. 
Actor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. 


Naturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. 
RoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Lil Gator Game launched last December, it captured our hearts as a fun, cozy adventure that drew obvious inspiration from the Legend of Zelda franchise. The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.
The free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.
Lil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC. For more on the short-but-sweet adventure, check out our review.]]></summary>

Chef’s kiss, no notes. The only downside is that the co-op craft-y-survive-a-thon is coming out on October 24th, the same week as - sweatily checks calendar - everything else. I’ll find the time to raid mines with big-bellied friends anyway, though.

As I’ve been finding out, it’s also a fine fit for the Steam Deck: performance issues are few, controls translate comfortably, and it won’t hog too much space on a microSD card. Handheld life is good for Fires of Rubicon, even if it likes to keep yours brutish and short.

But this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, "the entire game will be good", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.

At its core, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk wants to remind you how cool other games were. Specifically, Jet Set Radio, Jet Set Radio Future, and a tiny bit of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The problem is, by choosing nostalgia as its sole focus, Bomb Rush lacks an identity of its own – it only reminds me of why I'd rather play those other games instead. 
Bomb Rush attempts to right one of Sega's great crimes: the 21 years we've gone without a new Jet Set Radio game. For the uninitiated, Jet Set was an action sports series that put you in control of a gang of rollerbladers terrorizi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome have revealed that AK-xolotl will hit consoles and Switch this September. More specifically, the top-down roguelike shooter about a cute but deadly-with-a-gun axolotl will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14. 
The team announced this release date during today’s Future Games Show presentation with a new trailer showing more of the amphibious creature’s violent stroll through the animal kingdom, and it looks great. It features a fun retro throwback visual style and plenty of arcade-like action in combat. 
Check out the AK-xolotl release date trailer for yourself below: 


To coincide with today’s news, a new extended AK-xolotl demo is now live on Steam. Playstack vice president of publishing Rob Crossley says the game’s previously released demo hit almost 70,000 downloads and with player feedback from that demo, 2Awesome has “really managed to expand on some ideas and add a few new really cool features as well.” Some of those new features are present in the new demo, but Crossley says some are being held for the final release. 
AK-xolotl features five unique biomes, each with a variety of enemies, as well as dozens of weapons and power-ups. There are “tons of Axolittles to find and raise” and bosses you’ll love to hate, Playstack says. 

AK-xolotl hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Crunching Koalas and Developer Label This Studio revealed its psychological thriller, The Gap, last year at the 2022 Future Games Show. Now, the team has returned to this year’s Future Games Show with a new trailer for The Gap and an October release date. 
The Gap will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 19, and preorders for the game are now live. Today’s new trailer is about Maria, who seems to be either the wife of protagonist Joshua Hayes or his daughter. In The Gap, players must explore Joshua’s memories, both of the joyous and heart-wrenching kind, to find a solution to his family’s affliction thanks to a new rare genetic disorder. 
Check out the latest trailer for The Gap for yourself below: 


“Delve deep into the human psyche in The Gap, a psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves together the realms of memories, emotions, and corporate intrigue,” a press release reads. “The game revolves around Joshua Hayes, a dedicated neuroscientist, whose life takes a sudden turn when his family becomes afflicted by a rare genetic disorder. As memories fade and sanity slips away, Joshua is faced with an unimaginable challenge: finding a cure before his family’s essence is forever lost.” 
Here are some screenshots from The Gap:

As for BioWare’s two known in-development games, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and the next installment of Mass Effect, the studio says production on both are continuing. It says it is confident it has the time needed to ensure Dreadwolf reaches its full potential while a “core veteran team” led by Mike Gamble continues pre-production work on the next Mass Effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic point ‘n clicker series Broken Sword is planning a big comeback starting next year with a remaster of the original adventure game, followed by a new sixth entry sometime after. Snooping tourist George and snooping professional (investigative journalist) Nico will reunite in the all-new Broken Sword: Parzival’s Stone, but first, over two decades after it launched, Broken Sword - Shadow Of The Templars: Reforged revamps the first outing of the nosy duo. As you can see from the reveal trailer, it’s enjoying quite a dramatic makeover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lexar's NM790 PCIe 4.0 SSD is our 'best cheap PCIe  4.0 SSD for gaming' pick, offering extremely rapid speeds. It maxes out at 7400MB/s reads and 6500MB/s writes, near the boundary of the PCIe 4.0 standard, and random read/write figures are impressive too despite lacking a DRAM cache, using HMB instead. So I thought it worth mentioning that you can now pick up this 2TB high-end drive for £85, following a price drop from £93 at Amazon UK.

All you need to do is open a shutter and you can reveal unto the player all the wonders of the universe you have built, be that a giant, misty blue planet with a neon green dust ring, or purple nebula sweeping accross the sky like a bruise and crackling with lightning. Starfield's opening (shown off at Gamescom this week, and leaking all over the internet like a collander used for SMG target practice) does not forgo this moment, but it does say "okay but what if the grand reveal was entirely in shades of grey, though"?

There aren’t any cool menus in this trailer and my day is ruined. But the trailer also confirms that the game is due to launch on February 2nd, 2024, so we can gawk at the level-up screens soon.

Do you prefer ones that fire straight up and then swoop down like birds of prey, or the kind that jet off to the sides, trapping the target in a pincer formation? How about a single missile that splits into a swarm of smaller missiles? Perhaps a zig-zagger that leaves a trail of explosive charges in its wake, detonating them like dynamite dominoes once it impacts? Well, whatever your fancy, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon has a loadout for every occasion. With as many combinations as Dolly Parton's wardrobe, it’s almost a scandal to equip the same gear twice.

As a member of the niche mech-action genre, Armored Core has been out of commission for some time. The last entry in the series was a full 10 years ago, and since then, developer From Software’s other titles (Elden Ring, Bloodborne, etc.) have made the developer a household name. Now, the studio has returned with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (ACVI), applying many lessons from its other action games. Armored Core VI doesn’t revolutionize the mech game formula but refines it to create one of the genre's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aperture Desk Job is full of unexplained details. Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. 
On its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.]]></summary>

Or smash through buildings on horseback. Or smash through buildings as a giant gorilla. Or... you get the gist. In other words, there should be a metric mega-ton of options when the game hits early access next year, as you'd expect if you played the first Streets Of Rogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.


The original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights.

Little Nightmares III gives players the story of Low and Alone, two children trapped within The Spiral, which is a cluster of disturbing places, and they need to work together to escape from a threat that is lurking in the shadows.

This summer’s announcement of Mortal Kombat 1 brought with it a new era for the long-running fighting franchise. The latest game from NetherRealm Studios brings the outstanding fighting mechanics the series has been known for since the 2011 reboot, but adds layers of complexity.

Given that the first season is uninteresting, I'm not super fussed about that. What does sound good is quality-of-life changes coming alongside the new season. For starters, your inventory will no longer become clogged with six billion gems. Season Of Blood will also let you pick specific Unique and Uber Unique items to farm bosses for, which is most welcome given how vital Uniques can be for builds. Here, watch the trailer.

And thus, a new Snyderverse is born. Not that they showed us said game, mind, or really told us anything about it. It will be set after both Rebel Moon films, though, so you better get watching if you want to know what the hell is going on.

You play Pax, a pregnant con-artist on the run transporting an important package across the Northern border of what appears to be an authoritarian, dystopian USA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live, we got a new look at the gameplay and live-action scenes in the upcoming Alan Wake 2. The trailer begins with a slew of live-action footage – including Wake on a talk show.
The footage is then followed by gameplay showing combat with dual protagonists Saga Anderson and, of course, Alan Wake. It's all very spooky.
The footage was brief, but to see it yourself, check out the trailer below:


Alan Wake 2 was originally set to be released on October 17 but was pushed back to October 27. For more info, check out our recent preview.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year is shaping up to have a killer line-up of fighting games between the launches of Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter 6, but unfortunately, Tekken 8 won’t be completing the holy trinity as it just got a new release date: January 26th 2024. Not too far away from 2023’s punch-a-thon, though, and to tide us over, publisher Bandai Namco dropped a brand new trailer at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live. Bears, arcades, and lots of kicking down below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can't wait for Path Of Exile 2, and you've long since lost interest in Diablo 4, then you might want to cast your loot-hungry eyes toward Last Epoch, an upcoming time-travel fantasy ARPG that's been enjoying a successful stint in early access since 2019 and, as tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show revealed, is on track for a full release later this year. The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you. So let's back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a brand new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1, and it’s one of the wildest ones yet. It confirms that both Sindel and General Shao are playable characters, and we get another look at Liu Kang’s chosen champion, Raiden. 
The trailer begins with a cinematic cutscene setting up the ensuing fight as Liu Kang challenges Sindel to a duel by way of Raiden. It doesn’t take long for the trailer to become a gory mess of blood and guts, though, as we see Sindel, General Shao, and Raiden face off in various fights. The trailer also reveals two additional Kameo fighters: Motaro and Shujinko. 
Check out the Rulers of Outworld Mortal Kombat 1 trailer for yourself below: 


"As supreme ruler of Outworld’s army, General Shao has proven loyalty to his realm through countless victories in battle and possesses a gameplay style that dominates opponents with conquering strength and iron will," a press release reads. "Sindel is the empress of Outworld who fights to protect her family and empire with the ability to vanquish enemies with her mystifying hair, piercing scream, and power of levitation." 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19. 

For more about the game, check out this trailer that confirms Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik are on the roster and then watch this Keepers of Time trailer. After that, watch this trailer all about Rain and Smoke and then check out Game Informer’s hands-on Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay after that.

Announced at tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, Frontier Developments also showed off the game's new single-player Conquest mode, a procedurally generated series of challenges that will pit players against increasingly unpredictable combat scenarios, as well as its third playable faction: the wraith-like Nighthaunt. They'll be going up against the Stormcast Eternals alongside the Orruk Kruleboyz in the game's campaign, and I got to see them in action ahead of tonight's showcase. And I can confirm: they're a nasty bunch of spectral rags, this lot, especially when they pile on in large numbers.

Hence, though I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in open world survival crafting games like yer Valheims and what have you, I cocked my head like a dazzled magpie at the Gamescom release date trailer for Nightingale. It's the chintzy big swing fantasy (okay, Victoriana urban fantasy but it still counts) coming from Aaryn Flynn-founded studio Inflexion Games. And it's coming to an early access release near you on February 22nd next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap took fans of both the popular comics and movies company and collectible card games by storm last year thanks to its bite-sized, exciting gameplay and compelling collection and leveling-up mechanics. Both the mobile and Early Access PC versions have received various updates that include a Conquest series mode, friend PvP, and a ton of new cards and variants, but the PC version has remained in Steam Early Access until now.
However, during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, developer Second Dinner Studios' Ben Brode announced that Marvel Snap has exited Steam Early Access and is officially out now on PC. To celebrate, players who log into the PC version of Marvel Snap will receive a Devil Dinosaur Mech Variant. Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. 
"Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we've worked really hard to ensure it's an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love," Brode said in a press release. "This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can't wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we're live."
The PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today's livestream below.


Marvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer's Top 10 Games of the Year list.

But during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It's kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I'm into it.

Now, the studio has formally unveiled The Final Shape, the expansion concluding this decade-long story arc, and it launches on February 27, 2024. 
Bungie says in The Final Shape, Guardians will confront their ultimate adversary, The Witness, alongside companions from their years of adventures in Destiny 2, like Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Cayde-6, who has somehow returned after dying in the game’s Forsaken expansion. The Final Shape will take players right into the heart of the Traveler to end the War of Light and Darkness with the Vanguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Frontiers was released late last year, it was generally regarded as good but "rough around the edges." Because of that, it's been great to see Sega move to support the game further post-launch with a series of updates with free content. Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as "The Final Horizon" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.


The teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.
For any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now. If you're itching for more Sonic news, check out the latest issue of our digital magazine to learn about Sonic Superstars. You can also learn about its newly announced release date.]]></summary>

In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.
Sonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.
This announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.


Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20. We already knew this fall and holiday season would be fantastic for gamers, but it looks to be particularly awesome for fans of 2D platforming. For more on Sonic Superstars, be sure to hit the banner below for exclusive details surrounding the highly anticipated 2D adventure.]]></summary>

This combination proved popular, and today there's a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. 
The 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom Opening Night Live provided a platform for a new gameplay walkthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The video focuses on a new wrinkle called Open Combat Missions. These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.
You can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. 
Similar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the highly anticipated debut game from Inflexion Games, received a new Early Access release date during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live stream. We now know that the shared-world survival game will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in an Early Access state on February 22, 2024. 
In Nightingale, you control a Realmwalker as you venture through arcane portals in a procedurally generated Victorian gaslamp fantasy universe. Though survival crafting serves as the core gameplay loop, the studio touts its world-building and excellent visuals. The studio also pushes forward its ever-evolving narrative, which emphasizes play autonomy.

"[The Early Access date] is a few months later than previously announced," Inflexion Games CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. "But as a studio, we're committed to quality and take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfils our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come."
You can watch the Nightingale Early Access release date trailer below:


Nightingale arrives in Early Access via Steam and Epic Games Store on February 22, 2024, for $30. According to Inflexion Games, this launch will mark the beginning of the road to a 1.0 launch, with a high level of collaboration with the community. Inflexion hopes to continue iterating, improving, and adding to the game as the Early Access period continues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're keenly awaiting next month's launch of Starfield, Bethesda's new open-world sci-fi RPG, you can skip the new trailer. It's one of those live-action affairs with CG up the wazoo, complete with an 'epic' cover of Elton John's Rocket Man that would bring a tear to the eye of Zack Snyder*, and only Zack Snyder. It does not show the game at all, nor does it capture the thrill of escaping our Earthly bonds to find a load of grey rocks just like we have at home. But you can watch the trailer below.

        <updated>2023-08-22T18:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pearly Abyss, the studio behind Black Desert Online, has released a new trailer for its upcoming single-player open-world RPG, Crimson Desert, and it features our first look at new gameplay since 2020. 
The studio released this trailer as part of Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live presentation for Gamescom, and it features new 4K footage of protagonist Kliff investigating the region of Hernand. It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. 
Check out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. 
“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” 

Pearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. 
For more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.

        <updated>2023-08-22T18:05:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Game Science has released a new trailer for Black Myth: Wukong. Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony today, Black Myth: Wukong continues to look great.
Today’s trailer showcases more of the game’s action RPG combat alongside its dive into Chinese mythology. The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. 
You can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” 
Today’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glance at a Fort Solis screenshot and you might summarise it as "Dead Space if it were set in a moodier corner of Ridley Scott flick The Martian". The correct bundle of analogies is actually "Tacoma if it was made by Supermassive Games or Quantic Dream - and also, if it were set in a moodier corner of Ridley Scott flick The Martian". If you're unfamiliar with all of those things, here's the translation: this is a creepy but seldom scary mystery-horror game about a couple of engineers exploring an abandoned spacebase full of quick-time events (aka, "push the button before the prompt vanishes") and audio/video diaries from the Project X Proceeds Apace School of Ominous Backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom's Opening Night Live event, CD Projekt Red shared a new trailer and took to the stage to share what is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don't buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.


The footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.
The 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day. You can find Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review by following the link.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyper Light Breaker, the upcoming action title by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine, has been delayed. It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.
As such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, 
“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”


Hyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op. Players roam the large, colorful world discovering new areas, battling monsters in flashy combat, and obtaining powerful gear in a quest to overthrow a powerful king.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all of Supergiant’s games, I feel like Pyre is the odd duck out. Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).
The rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.

        <updated>2023-08-22T14:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the 1983 video game crash and Nintendo’s subsequent takeover of the industry with the NES, the Atari 2600 reigned supreme. The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. 
Atari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players.

Adventure

Surround
Video Pinball
Yar’s Revenge
“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”
The Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.]]></summary>
