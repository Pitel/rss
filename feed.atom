When this happens, as anyone who has played a Bethesda RPG will know, you go from being a nimble killing machine to a near-immovable lump of stone.

While it's hard to draw strong conclusions across the board, new research into the effects of TV show piracy finds there is a promotional side to illegal downloading. By generating online "buzz" on YouTube, Google, and Twitter, negative effects on legitimate viewership start to disappear.

Kupříkladu jak vdechnout 30 let starým digitálkám nový život náhradní elektronikou, logický analyzátor z RP2040, kde sehnat učebnice programování STM32 v češtině, nové pluginy pro KiCAD nebo jak odemknout naprogramované ATtiny, pokud jde o vážná témata.

Z kategorie úsměvných může působit například ezonávod na opravu LED žárovky na webu zabývajícím se (možná poněkud "alternativním") zdravím, trollení majitelů Tesel otevíráním "palivových" víček na dálku nebo sluchátkové zesilovače s elektronkovým koncovým stupněm, kterému předchází osmijádrový procesor XMOS.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 2. května od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, doražte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

As much as we love the Nintendo Switch, one downside is the fact so many great games still are still exclusive to Japan. With this in mind, our American-based video producer Zion Grassl has rounded up a bunch of games that we would love to see localised.
There are all sorts of games from Yo-Kai Watch 4, Dragon Quest X to Buddy Mission: Bond. Below is a quick list of the games we think should be given a chance here in the west. You can get the full rundown in the video above.

The year is moving along quickly, and the Switch has been relatively busy in terms of major releases. On the eShop, though, April proved to be another packed month with a range of highly regarded ports and awesome new games. Once again, then, it's time to try and pick the best of them all from the last month.
These awards aim to celebrate the best of Nintendo's digital store, giving some love and attention to the games that could so easily be missed in the Switch's ever-growing download library. It's worth noting we've focus on download-only games and not retail downloads, DLCs and so on.

The EU and Japanese box arts for Kirby's Dream Land went head-to-head, and although the abstract nature of Japan's box art gained a few fans, it was the EU's more traditional approach that won the day, taking in 61% of the vote.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far from a miserable pile.
Castlevania first launched in Japan on the Famicom Disk System on 26th September 1986, but in honour of the series' 35th anniversary on NES in North America today, it's the perfect time to revisit this ranked list of every Castlevania game on Nintendo consoles. Enjoy!

The Castlevania series has a rich history on Nintendo consoles ever since the original game came first to the Japanese Famicom Disk System way back in 1986, and then to the NES a year later. There may be a significant release or two from Konami's vampire-killing catalogue still missing from Nintendo platforms (we're looking at you, Symphony of the Night), but the vast majority of the series can be found on Nintendo consoles.

Although there's still a lot of demand for the Switch, Nintendo is reportedly bracing itself for a decline in hardware sales.
According to Nikkei Asia, the Japanese video game giant expects to sell "only about 20 million Switch game consoles" in the current fiscal year, which would be a 10% decrease from fiscal year 2021. Nikkei goes on to state how it has learned that "a semiconductor shortage and disruptions to logistics networks" are contributing factors.

Regardless of the individual flavours, the addictive mixture of cinematic terror and B-movie shlock and gore runs through them all. But which Resident Evil is the best?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing the second game in Supergiant's catalog, Transistor.
Released for PlayStation 4 on May 18, 2014, and PC a day later, Transistor was a very different game for Supergiant to make compared to its freshman effort a few years prior. Development started just a few months following the release of Bastion, and while its first game was a success, the tight-knit studio wanted to prove what it did wasn't lightning in a bottle. In this episode, we discuss the various ways Supergiant pushed against the ever-present shadow of Bastion in the games design and the studio's production methods. We also cover the process of creating a new retro-inspired cyberpunk setting, the unique tactical action combat, and how the studio landed on a voiceless lounge singer named Red and her talking sword, the Transistor, as the main characters.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Magazine Content Director Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Transistor! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Hold on, it's May on Sunday? We're a little bit confused about that here at Nintendo Life Towers — how are we already in the fifth month of 2022? Blimey. Anyway, after the release date chaos of last week, this week has been decidedly more steady. Reggie Fils-Aimé's SXSW talk is now available, and in it, he reveals how the legendary Satoru Iwata's death affected his decision to leave Nintendo. We've got some tips from Nintendo on how to deal with Switch battery issues. And Yuji Naka claims that he was removed as Balan Wonderworld director by Square Enix in a pretty revealing Twitter thread.
Also, for you lovely Europeans out there, we've highlighted our picks from the Spring into Action sale on Switch. There are thousands of deals, so go check them out, but don't blame us if you spend all of your pennies!

Whether you consider this a celebration of spring, the start of summer, a day for workers, or just a long weekend, may you have a good'un.

As you've probably seen, the new Min Min Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo is now available in-store. If you are planning on adding this one to your collection, here's your PSA that this new amiibo based on the fighter from the ARMS series might not actually need to be unboxed to be used.
As highlighted by a user (with a North American Min Min model) on the amiibo subreddit, this new amiibo's packaging may not have an "NFC blocker tag", which prevents Nintendo fans from scanning the NFC figure while it's still inside the box.

The former Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aimé, is currently doing the rounds online to promote his new book Disrupting the Game. If you thought you've heard everything he's had to say, perhaps not.

Strange Scaffold's hit indie title Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator launched on PC and Xbox via Game Pass last December. However, in a surprise move, the developer has announced that its organ trading sim is out right now on Nintendo Switch. Well, that's the quickest deal we've seen in a while!
With a name like Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, you can tell this is going to be something very different. You are an organ trader who makes profits from body parts. Throughout space, you'll be trading and selling with unusual clients such as a mysterious astronaut-looking dude named Quartermaster, a fungus (maybe?) called Farmer Popkin, and "legally not a dog" Chad Shakespeare, who looks like a dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes fan service just isn't enough.
When something becomes popular enough, it is bound to attract imitators. Sometimes those imitators will smash as many different genres together to try to capitalise on multiple other games' popularity. In the case of Waifu Impact, the developers took the principles that have made Fortnite a bewildering success and combined them with a healthy dose of fan service to attract players, plus a lick of Genshin Impact-style presentation. There's nothing wrong with taking what has been popular in the past and serving it up in a new way; players sometimes need a little familiarity to help them settle into a new game. However, a high level of polish is required, and with Waifu Impact that polish just isn’t there. Even worse than awkward and clunky gameplay, it simply isn’t fun.
Waifu Impact sees players dropped onto glorious 'Waifu Island', a place visited nightly in the dreams of many; a tropical paradise hosting cute girls running around shooting each other with water guns. It is the basic premise that we saw in Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash, but with stripped-back features. Instead of different teams vying for control of the arena, it is a free-for-all against the AI-controlled enemies who all look and play the exact same. Instead of the barely contained chaos, with action coming at you from every angle — the things that make other arena shooters fun to play — this feels like a slog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding your niche can often be the key to success for smaller developers, but Swedish team Image & Form refuse to be pigeonholed. Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can't say it's one of the best dueling games ever, but it's the best one I've played for ages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of 12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford’s Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It’s mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don’t need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you’re greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won’t see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you’ll have to go elsewhere.

Instead, it comes by way of a new Yoshida interview in a free magazine currently being given away at Uniqlo stores in Japan, as discovered by Twitter user alverich_ff14 and translated by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If, at any point, while playing through the Mass Effect series, you’ve thought to yourself, “I really wouldn’t mind a replica of the Reaper Sovereign ship,” then today’s your day. 
That’s because BioWare and Dark Horse Direct have unveiled a new 14-inch Reaper Sovereign ship replica, and it’s beautiful. What’s more, it’s available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it’s something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don’t have to wait too long to have it in your hands. 

“Reaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,” Dark Horse’s description reads. “This spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.” 
Gentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA’s Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect. 
Are you going to pick up one of these replica Reaper ships? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Nearly a year later, Young Horses, the game’s developer, announced during a Sony State of Play the game would be getting a new DLC. Called The Isle of Bigsnax, the expansion will be free for players who already own the base game. On top of a fresh story, which should take three to five hours to complete according to the creators, fans can expect a slew of new content. And while it’s aiming to release in the first half of 2022, we got an early hands-on look at the game at GDC.
Adding hours of playtime to the original game, Young Horses announced players would receive their own in-game dwelling to renovate. Now you can …]]></summary>

The RTX 3080 Ti offers comparable performance to the RTX 3090 while costing far less, and today there's an OC model available at the card's UK RRP. It's an Ventus 3X OC model from MSI, with a hefty triple-slot thermal solution that ought to keep the card cool and quiet even running at its factory overclocked 1695MHz. 
To get the discounted price, use code SAVE75 to knock a healthy £75 off the list price. That brings it down to £1054, just £5 more than the UK RRP and a great deal for an OC model. You also get free delivery, with the card slated to arrive just after the upcoming bank holiday.

That could mean anything from a solo developer working on a debut title to critically acclaimed teams releasing self-published works. While these games have been around as long as the industry, their popularity surged in the early 2000s. This was partly due to new digital distribution and crowdfunding options, which presented opportunities for some would-be game makers.
Though many of gaming’s best-loved indies belong to this early era, independently made games reached a whole new level of mainstream attention in the following decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is the next title in the franchise. 
Surprising nobody, especially considering that the company had previously revealed that this year’s Call of Duty would be a sequel to 2019’s Call of Duty Modern Warfare reboot, a new teaser dropped on Twitter today revealed not just the title, but the logo for this sequel, too.
coverage here.

You can check it out below:

April 28, 2022
As you can see, there’s really not much to glean from it. It sounds very Modern Warfare-y and looks very Modern Warfare-y, too, but it doesn’t reveal much about the actual game. Perhaps there’s something to be made out of the muddled voices playing during the trailer, but it’s likely that this teaser is just setting the stage for a bigger reveal in the coming weeks or months. The Call of Duty account that tweeted out the teaser does say, “The new era of Call of Duty is coming,” so perhaps the company believes this game will shake up the franchise in a big way. 
It wouldn’t be surprising because Infinity Ward's 2019 Modern Warfare reboot did just that for the series, especially in its rollout a few months before Call of Duty: Warzone. Plus, 2019’s Modern Warfare is still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty in recent years. With Infinity Ward working on Modern Warfare II, fans are likely excited to see what this sequel looks like. Sadly, there’s no telling when the next look will be but if it’s like Call of Duty reveals in years past, we could be weeks or even days away. Only time will tell.
In the meantime, read about how a sequel to Warzone is expected to drop this year and then check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023. Read Game Informer’s Modern Warfare review after that.

Rogue Legacy 2 has been in early access for a couple of years, building upon its predecessor’s fun – and challenging – roguelite formula. You still control members of a warrior bloodline who must battle through a procedurally generated castle rife with dangers. Every death gives you a new character you can outfit with helpful/strange genetic traits, from dealing increased attack damage to farting every time you perform an action. 
Watch on Twitch!
Look forward to watching a fun stream as I’ll likely be sending an entire generation of warriors to their doom. Our review will arrive in the coming days, so be sure to read our review in progress for editor John Carson’s current thoughts on the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios’ celebrated anti-war game, This War of Mine, is getting revamped and expanded for a re-release on modern consoles.
Dubbed the Final Cut, the game, in which players manage a party of civilians surviving in a war-torn city, is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S –including Xbox Game Pass – on May 10. It boasts a 4K resolution and a readjusted UI. Content-wise, it includes the locations from the base game and introduces a new character, quests, and events. 
Additionally, the three DLC narrative episodes, This War of Mine: Stories, will be available for purchase separately on PS5/XSX. This War of Mine: Complete Edition is a bundle containing Final Cut and Stories if you want everything.  
11 Bit Studios, based in Poland, states that the ongoing Ukraine/Russia conflict is the motivator to re-release This War of Mine and repromote its anti-war messaging to a new group of players. The studio recently raised nearly $700,000 for Ukrainian civilian aid by heavily discounting the previous versions of This War of Mine. 11 Bit CEO Przemek Marszal says in a press release: 
"The message and themes existing inside of This War of Mine have, unfortunately, become brutally vivid and relevant in recent months. We believe it’s especially important to educate people on the realities of war right now, while its horrifying reality has become a daily struggle for people that are close to us. We’re proud that recent This War of Mine fundraising helped us create a wave of spontaneous help for war victims in Ukraine, and we hope we can further spread our antiwar message with This War of Mine: Final Cut.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, the dev duo that make up Analgesic Productions , seem to make games about scientists. Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”

They're a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they'll flower into a roguelike that you won't be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it's something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.

That’s quite a lot, and it sounds like players will be able to play through The Quarry dozens of times without having the same experience.

The announcement is light on details right now, as you might expect, but there’s the promise of a “diverse line-up of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC”. Personally, I'm hoping we'll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3 too. Here's hoping!

More specifically, the special event stream will be about the game’s upcoming expansion, Sunbreak, and it will begin at 7 a.m. PT/9 a.m. CT/10 a.m. ET on May 10. It will be streamed on the official Monster Hunter Twitch channel and according to the announcement tweet, will feature “exciting reveals of new gameplay info, monsters, and more.” As for how long it will run, that remains unknown. 


A teaser trailer for this digital event, which you can watch above, reveals a few more tidbits of info. 
“Get ready for a brand new trailer, more monster reveals, much-awaited info about new Hunter actions, and additional game features,” the trailer reads.
As you can expect, director Yoshitake Suzuki will be presenting during the showcase. Not much else was shared about this event but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too much longer to learn more about Sunbreak because the event begins in less than two weeks. 
In the meantime, read about Sunbreak’s confirmed June release date and then check out the previous Sunbreak reveal that highlighted new monsters and locations. Read Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review after that.

More specifically, the showcase will air on June 12, beginning at 10 a.m PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. ET, and will feature “amazing titles coming from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and our partners around the world." 
As for what to expect, the showcase will focus on games that will soon hit Xbox Series X/S consoles and PC. However, these showcases have been known to surprise-reveal new titles early in development, so it wouldn’t be surprising if games with no release date are showcased. 
“The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will include everything you need to know about the diverse lineup of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC,” the Xbox Wire post reads. 
Nothing else was revealed besides some links to social and streaming channels where you can watch this showcase. There’s no mention of specific games, the runtime of the event, or anything like that. However, with Starfield set to release on Nov. 11, there’s a good chance we finally get a deeper look at what this game is. Only time will tell, though.

Off your cute wee peglin goes on an adventure, battling baddies and claiming treasures, but damage is dealt by pling-plonging orbs down Peggle/pachinko boards and you have a bag of different orbs instead of cards. I like it, and it has a demo you can try for yourself.

While it's not disputed that 'Destiny 2 Hacks' were offered for sale, the court is not convinced that these are copyright infringing. The trademark claims are intact, however, so the case is far from resolved.

I'm too old and thin-skinned to enjoy the competitive nature of most online FPS games, and rallying together a regular squad of buddies to tackle the world of games as a service always seemed too much like hard work. Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I've seen them take hold in friends and family. But with Dorfromantik, the chill, pastoral village builder from Toukana Interactive, I finally understand the journey towards that mythic 'forever' status.

Far: Lone Sails introduced the idea of crafting a ship of questionable quality as it makes its way across a mysterious landscape, and Far: Changing Tides continued those core principles with some fun new twists.
Changing Tides focuses on a seaborne ship that gradually gains new components and features as the player encounters new obstacles. In an especially fitting way to highlight the game’s distinctiveness, the game makers partnered with Aaron Newman, a professional LEGO-building artist, to create a custom LEGO set of the ship seen in the game. Newman was a LEGO Masters USA Season 1 contestant and has since moved on to be a product designer at The LEGO group, though it’s important to note …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re looking to add more of the Street Fighter roster to your Fortnite Outfit collection, tomorrow is your chance. That’s because popular fighters Blanka and Sakura hit the Fortnite Item Shop at 8 p.m. EST on Thursday, April 28. 
Announced by Epic Games in a new blog post, World Warriors Blanka and Sakura hit the battle royale to celebrate 35 years of Street Fighter and as is usual with new additions to Fortnite, both characters will come with an Outfit and matching accessories to round out the skin. Plus, the Blanka & Sakura Cup, which will begin as a mobile-only Zero Build Solo Cup starting today before becoming an all-platforms Battle Royale Solo Cup on Thursday, will give top-performing players in different regions the chance to unlock the Bonus Stage Loading Screen. 
The first Outfit is the Blanka Outfit and it includes the Blanka Delgado alt Style, inspired by Rival Schools’ Boman Delgado, too. This Outfit includes a built-in Blanka Backflip Emote and it comes with the Blanka-Chan Back Bling. You can also purchase the Tropical Hazarad Kebab Pickaxe in the Item Shop, too. 

For Sakura, you can pick up the standard Sakura Outfit, and with it, you’ll get the Sakura Gym alt Style inspired by one of her Street Fighter IV alts. The Outfit includes the built-in Sakura’s Victory Sway Emote, too, as well as the Hanakaze Claw Back Bling. You can also purchase the Fighting Tournament Trophy Pickaxe and the Kayari Buta Glider, too. 

For more information about these new Outfits, as well as additional details regarding the upcoming Blanka & Sakura Cup, head to Epic Games' blog post. While waiting for these Street Fighters to hit the game, read about how rapper Emicida is coming to Fortnite this weekend for a concert, and then check out the recently-released Wu-Tang Clan Outfits added to the game. Check out all of the Marvel and DC superheroes added to Fortnite thus far after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May’s PlayStation Plus games line-up has been revealed (after suffering yet another pre-announcement leak). On May 3, subscribers will have access to the following titles: 
FIFA 22: Last year’s FIFA title boasts new-gen visuals and enhancements, making for a football title that looks better than it ever has. Though it ultimately doesn’t differ too much from FIFA 21, fans of the sport should find it an enjoyable, if not very familiar, simulator. | Our Review
Tribes of Midgard: This colorful Norse-themed survival action game that you can experience alone or with friends in co-op. You’ll build and manage a village that up to 10 players can occupy, and you’ll maintain it by harvesting materials out in the wild. Plenty of dangers, both earthly and mythical, lurk in the wilderness for you and a party to cut down with your sword. 
Curse of the Dead Gods: As an explorer fueled by greed, you’ll explore the depths of perilous temples battling monsters and plundering treasure in this run-based action roguelite. Surviving floor after floor of dangers requires accumulating powerful runes, but gaining power also saddles you with curses for a risk vs reward element. | Our Review
If you haven’t added April’s batch of PS Plus titles to your library, you have until May 2 to do so before they become unavailable. You’ll want to do the same for Persona 5, which is also exiting the PS Plus Collection on May 11. 
This will presumably be the final month of PS Plus as we know it before the introduction of new premium tiers in June. You can learn more about what that will entail here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new raft of Ryzen 5000 processors has hit virtual and physical shelves, making it a good time to pick up a new AM4 CPU at a discounted price. The appearance of the lower-end Ryzen 5500, 5600 and mid-range 5700X have pushed prices for their more expensive counterparts way down, while the 5800X3D remains hard to find due to its relatively low supply and impressive gaming performance. 
If you were thinking of upgrading, you might be interested to know which retailers in the US and UK are selling each of these processors, and for how much. I was interested myself, so I put together a couple of small spreadsheets to find out - and the results suprised me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of the Blue Games, the makers of 2020’s Call of the Sea, has announced its second title: American Arcadia.
Inspired by works such as The Truman Show, Logan’s Run, and The Prisoner, the game takes place in Arcadia, a retro-futuristic 1970s city. Players control Trevor Hills, an average town resident who discovers his entire world is just an elaborate reality TV show broadcasted 24/7 to millions of Americans. To escape his false existence, Trevor teams up with the show’s stage technician, Angela Solano, and the pair must work together to evade the clutches of Arcadia’s security forces. 


American Arcadia features two gameplay styles. Trevor's action unfolds as a 2.5D action side-scroller fearing plenty of puzzle-solving as well as elements of stealth. Controlling Angela shifts the game to first-person to complete specific hacking and puzzle segments. Cissy Jones and Yuri Lowenthal, who portrayed Call of the Sea’s protagonists, reunite to voice Angela and Trevor, respectively.
American Arcadia has already been selected for Tribeca’s 2022 Festival Games. It will launch for PC and unspecified consoles, but it does not have a release window.]]></summary>

Unfortunately, for fans wanting either, it doesn’t sound like these features are planned for the title right now.

The update is also dropping for Call of Duty: Vanguard. In addition to new guns and a special timed event featuring Godzilla and King Kong (because of course), this season also sees the debut of some new types of private matches - although Raven have qualified that the latter are temporarily disabled due to “stability issues”. At least that gives us time to download the 39GB update for Warzone, but remember to leave 13GB extra room for the patch to copy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney fans, take note. Today, Gameloft announced a new free-to-play life-simulation adventure game called Disney Dreamlight Valley. In it, you brush shoulders with various Disney and Pixar characters, creating your own avatar and life in their magical world. The adventure challenges you to uncover the mysteries of Dreamlight Valley, where its inhabitants have lost their memories due to an event called The Forgetting. You must solve the case and restore the now desolate place to its former glory, putting your own mark on it in the process.
The reveal trailer above should give you a taste of the experience, where you enter classic Disney and Pixar worlds and help iconic characters get back their memories. A big bonus? You'll also be designing your own villages with various Disney items and customization options, from Frozen-inspired antique kitchen designs for your abode to princess-inspired ballgowns for your avatar.
During your journey, you can interact with and befriend popular franchise characters who have their own unique story arcs. The press release confirms familiar faces will appear from The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Toy Story, and Moana. It also promises fun activities like cooking Disney-themed dishes alongside Remy from Ratatouille, fishing with Goofy, and growing vegetables from Wall-E's garden patch. 
This summer, the game enters Early Access, which you can join by purchasing a Founders Pack or by being an Xbox Game Pass member. As an early adopter, you get to not only provide feedback to the development team but you'll also earn exclusive awards, which will carry over when the full game releases. Disney Dreamlight Valley is currently set for an official launch in 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Mac. 
For more information, you can visit the official site here. And stay tuned for impressions from our demo of the game, which will go live tomorrow.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Stanley Parable is a game about a man who leaves his desk one day to discover that all of his most difficult to animate colleagues have vanished. First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.


But most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.

I've given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.
As I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.

        <updated>2022-04-27T14:27:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software released a new patch today that fixes a Malenia bug that unintentionally made the boss fight much harder. 
Dubbed Update Version 1.04.1, this patch fixes a bug with the Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight in Elden Ring’s endgame that allowed her to heal herself at any time if you were in online co-op. This was a problem because Malenia is only supposed to self-heal upon damaging you, in a vampiric way. That she was able to self-heal at really any time was causing quite the conundrum for players looking to defeat her, who is already arguably the most challenging boss in the entire game. This new patch fixes that fortunately, and it brings with it a few other fixes too. 


Here’s what Update Version 1.04.1 brings to Elden Ring: 
Fixed a bug in which the effect duration of the Cerulean Hidden Tears was revised downward
Fixed a bug with Malenia, Blade of Miquella in which her HP was not healed correctly in the online multiplayer environment
Fixed a bug that causes some bosses to die at unintended times.
Fixed a bug that prevented the boss “Elden Beast” from working properly under certain circumstances
Fixed some texts
“The version number of this update shown at the lower right corner of the Title Screen will be as follows: App Ver. 1.04.1, Regulation Ver. 1.04.2,” the patch notes read. 
As expected, in order to play online in Elden Ring, you must have this update installed. For more about the game, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about an Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the closed colosseum, where once inside, they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies. Read about a recent update that adjusted sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that.

Don’t worry, you’ll have the option to transfer over your games, saves and Wallet balance until May 11th. You'll have to redownload everything unfortunately, but any game you happen to own via the Bethesda.net Launcher should appear as a free purchase on a linked Steam account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I might not have owned Nintendo’s seventh-generation home console when Wii Sports launched in 2006, but I was well aware of its cultural impact. I recall booting up the wacky sports simulator at my sister’s apartment and joyously swinging my Remote/Nunchuk to hit a baseball, throw a quick jab, or swing a golf club. So, it feels serendipitous that I’m reviewing Switch Sports 16 years later. Diving into the second sequel’s six activities alone and with friends (locally) has been a fun, nostalgic rush. I haven’t had access to the game's online multiplayer component, which, as you can imagine, houses a bulk of Switch Sports’ content. So, while I can’t talk about ranked progression, the cosmetic/currency systems, and exclusively-online modes, here are my thoughts on everything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matt Reeves’ The Batman is getting a sequel, to probably nobody’s surprise. 
Not only did the movie do really well at the box office, especially as the silver screen continues to struggle to bounce back amidst the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, but it was well-received by both critics and fans alike. Now, DC has confirmed that The Batman will get a sequel with Matt Reeves returning to write and direct and Robert Pattinson set to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader, as reported by Variety. 
The publication notes that this was announced last night during Warner Bros. CinemaCon presentation and while the company revealed a sequel is happening, not much else was shared. As for a villain or storyline, we’re all still just as in the dark as we were before the sequel was revealed. However, those who have seen The Batman, which is now streaming on HBO Max for subscribers, there are a number of threads the sequel could move forward with, both in terms of potential villains and potential storylines. We won’t spoil those threads here, but The Batman sequel seems to be heading in a certain direction. 
The Batman hit theaters last month, raking in $134 million domestically, Variety reports, and its ticket sales still represent the biggest opening weekend for any movie in 2022. Today, its global box office sits around $759 million, making it the highest grossing movie of the year thus far (although Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is eyeing that throne). 
While waiting for a sequel to The Batman, read Game Informer’s coverage of two upcoming DC games, Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League.

Published by Raw Fury, American Arcadia centres on Trevor Hills – an average bloke in flares, tank top and ‘tache – who is a bit too boring to survive the unwitting reality-show metropolis of Arcadia where he lives. Cue a mysterious guide who may or may not be trying to help Trev escape. It's good to hear that Yuri Lowenthal and Cissy Jones are back on voice duties, presumably as Trevor and his new pal, after their top-notch performances in Call Of The Sea.

It's a game about bending and distorting shapes by applying mathematical transformations, starting with a simple flat sheet and aiming to replicate elaborate 3D shapes which look like blown glass sculptures. It's done cleverly and simply by dragging shapes through zones which distort them in real time but alas, I myself am simple too. Some of the shapes I've accidentally made in Tandis are downright reality-breaking.

Sure enough, it wasn't Diablo 4 , but a mobile game called Diablo Immortal. Blizzard's warnings didn't stop the developers from being booed on stage at Blizzcon, which seemed harsh.

Now that Diablo 4 has been announced (in 2019) and we've seen all the ways it's catering to fans of classic Diablo 2, perhaps the world is ready for Immortals. If that's so, then good news: it's now also coming to PC, with a free-to-play open beta on June 2nd.

The Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 for Switch will remain playable. The same immunity applies to Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis library for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.
Sega has not cited a reason for this move, but the publisher evidently wants to steer players towards Origins if they want their classic Sonic fix. Rockstar Games made a similar move when it delisted the PC versions of the Grand Theft Auto games that appeared in last year’s ill-fated Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition. The decision earned significant backlash from fans before the collection launched, as many felt Rockstar was limiting their options for purchasing the classic entries. That situation further backfired due to the Trilogy’s botched release, and Rockstar eventually restored the standalone GTA titles to PC storefronts. 
Sonic Origins bundles remastered versions of the Genesis-era platformers. It boasts enhancements such as new and improved animations, new gameplay modes, and the option to play as Tails/Knuckles in each game, among other features. It’s slated to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms, Switch, and PC. The game comes in two editions – a $39.99 standard version and a $44.99 Deluxe – with a few content packs that you can read about here.]]></summary>

The terribly named Moviedle does something different. The aim, again, is to identify a movie, but instead of a single frame, it squeezes the entire movie into a single second. Get it wrong and you get a two-second version, and so on.

Players will leave the safe orbit where other humans await salvation and begin exploring an Earth covered in a thick layer of toxic dust following an ecological disaster in hopes of learning more about its demise and uncovering secrets that could save the human race. The reveal trailer gets straight to the point – humans messed Earth up and failed to do what was needed to save it. Sound familiar?

        <updated>2022-04-26T15:29:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has announced that the next artist in its Soundwave Series, which sees artists from around the world perform on creative islands, is rapper Emicida. 
Emicida is one of the biggest rappers in Brazil, and his performance will begin Friday, April 29, at 6 p.m. EST. It will repeat non-stop for 72 hours until Monday, May 2, at 6 p.m. EST. To accompany Emicida’s performance, the Keep Going Lobby Track and Triumphant Emote will be available in the Fortnite Item Shop starting this Thursday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST. Upon completing Emicada’s experience, you’ll receive some XP and the Soundwave Series – Emicada Spray as a memento from the show. 
As for what to expect beyond the actual performance, you’ll find a creative island inspired by Emicida’s life journey and how it influenced his music, made by community creators BertBuilds, Paradox Builds, and Zen Creative. 
“The setlist, which includes some of Emicida’s biggest hits, tells the story of how he grew up in Jardim Cachoeira in the north of São Paulo, Brazil, and became one of the most popular rappers in Brazil and a successful artist worldwide,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “In the experience, Emicida shares a bit of his path as a rapper, from where he was doing street rap battles to becoming recognized internationally.” 

Players will have the option to watch the show via Picture-in-Picture while playing other Creative Experiences, Battle Royale, and more if they don’t want to experience it on the creator-built island. However, Epic Games says this is available only during certain times of the event. It can be accessed through the game’s settings, but interactive elements will not be playable if the experience is viewed through Picture-in-Picture. 
For more about Emicida’s Soundwave Series event, read the full Epic Games blog post.

All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher's Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated.

Each level is a course with straights and corners and demons. You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you've turned every demon along the way into a red paste.
The game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It's quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that's worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it's a payoff you'll remember.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players suspect that a closed colosseum in Elden Ring could be the location for a potential PvP-based DLC or expansion. Popular From Software modder Lance McDonald was able to look inside it with a mod. He confirmed that the colosseum’s outer walls aren’t just set dressing but actual walls to an arena. 
As reported by Video Games Chronicle, another From Software modder, Sekiro Dubi, used a mod to enter the colosseum and explore it even further. Surprisingly, Sekiro Dubi discovered not just a colosseum to explore, but two additional Elden Ring enemies and even a new Site of Grace, which are Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls' bonfires. 


As noted by VGC, the Site of Grace seems to indicate that this area was reachable within the game at one point or another, unless, of course, this Site of Grace will become reachable one day in a patch or DLC that allows players into the colosseum. Sekiro Dubi notes in their video above that the Site of Grace is called “?PlaceName?” (an obvious placeholder name) in the locations menu, but they point out that leaked Network Test files point to it being called Leyndell Colosseum. 
As far as new enemies go, there’s a Gladiator Large and an Old Lion of the Arena, neither of which can be found elsewhere in Elden Ring. Sekiro Dubi notes that in-game lore indicates that this colosseum was a place where warriors fought against beasts. 
For now, this colosseum remains inaccessible to the standard playerbase as it’s only reachable via mods. However, many speculate that it will become a PvP arena someday. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about how Elden Ring was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the second month in a row. Read about the latest Elden Ring patch that adjusts sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Apex Legends Season 12 coming to a close, fans have been eagerly waiting for news about the next chapter in Respawn’s battle royale and what it has to offer. A cinematic trailer dropped yesterday, revealing the game’s next defensive legend, Newcastle, while showcasing Titanfall Spectres and feral wildlife along Storm Point’s tropical beaches. You can watch the footage below. 


Apex loremasters might already know that Bangalore has a friendly rivalry and close relationship with her older brother, Jackson. While protecting Bangalore during the Battle of Gridiron, Jackson is presumed KIA. We join Bangalore after some time has passed; she’s announced her retirement from the Apex Games. At the same time, a masked defender named Newcastle is slated to be her replacement. Of course, explosive hijinks ensue while the two squad up for Bangalore’s final battle royale match. Bullets whiz past faces, grenades leave craters in the sand, and Titanfall Spectres ambush our favorite legends while they slay a massive beast. Bangalore is surprised to learn the truth behind Newcastle’s mysterious identity by the end of it all.
Season 13 “Saviors” might shift up the meta with the inclusion of Newcastle. While the terminology for the character’s abilities isn't clear, it’s safe to assume that he’ll keep his teammates safe with well-timed fortifications. According to speculation, he might even be able to drag downed allies out of the fight while reviving them. If this holds, then we’re in for significant changes in the casual and competitive levels of play.

Think of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal’s Illumination Entertainment’s upcoming film adaptation of the Super Mario Bros. series is delayed to next spring. 
Instead of hitting theaters on Dec. 21 of this year, the movie will be released on April 7 in North America and a few weeks later in Japan, on April 28. This announcement came by way of a rather odd tweet from the Nintendo of America account that seems to indicate the news comes straight from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself. 
This is Miyamoto. After consulting with Chris-san, my partner at Illumination on the Super Mario Bros. film, we decided to move the global release to Spring 2023–April 28 in Japan and April 7 in North America. My deepest apologies but I promise it will be well worth the wait.
April 26, 2022
The Illumination Twitter account released the news at the same time last night with a similar message. 
“Miyamoto-san and I have been collaborating on all aspects of the Super Mario Bros. film and, together with our partners at Universal, have decided to move the global release to Spring 2023 – April 7 in North America and April 28 in Japan. We are excited to share this incredible film with you.” 
As you can see, neither company lists a definitive reason for the delay, but it seems like the movie simply needed some additional time in the oven. Considering that this is Nintendo’s first significant foray into animated silver screen features and how big the Mario brand is, it makes sense to take all the time needed to make this movie the best it can be. 
Reports from November of last year indicated that Nintendo was happy with the film thus far. Miyamoto reportedly even hinted that more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. While waiting to see if that becomes true, check out the complete cast list for this Super Mario Bros. film. 
Are you excited about this movie? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck software update is a biggun, with Valve adding an arguably overdue lock screen to their handheld PC. This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.


Without the update, it’s possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn’t at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It’s definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.

In a blog post today, Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at PlayStation, introduced VRR and described the basics of how it works. "On HDMI 2.1 VRR-compatible TVs and PC monitors, VRR dynamically syncs the refresh rate of the display to the PS5 console’s graphical output. This enhances visual performance for PS5 games by minimizing or eliminating visual artifacts, such as frame pacing issues and screen tearing," writes Nishino. “It causes the games to look smoother overall and can even reduce input latency.”

As they stand now, Mega Evolutions require a hefty amount of candy for a particular Pokémon to evolve into its larger form, which is only available for a set amount of time. Each time the player wants to use this powerful form, more candy is required, and it isn't easy to come by, as it is tied to timed raids and missions.
After the update hits, there will be a one-time cost for Mega Evolving a Pokémon, meaning you can evolve it freely without using more candy. The only catch here is that your Pokémon will become fatigued after transforming and will need time to regain its fighting form before evolving again. Mega Energy can be used to reduce the amount of time it takes for that Pokém…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3070 Ti is a great mid-range to high-end GPU, with excellent performance in rasterised games plus DLSS and RT support, but it's been hard to find at a good price if you haven't lucked out with a Founders Edition restock. Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within £100 of the £549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost £1000 or more at the beginning of the year. 
The cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we've found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking £649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year.

This news comes by way of The NPD Group’s Mat Piscatella in his usual monthly NPD numbers round-up. While Xbox Series X/S took home the gold medal in terms of dollar sales, the Switch sold the most units in March 2022 and in the first quarter of the year. Xbox’s great March sales led to March 2022 being an all-time high March record for the hardware platform. NPD reports that previous Xbox bests for March were set in March 2011 (in terms of unit sales) and in March 2014 (in terms of dollar sales).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who doesn’t want to go to wizard school? In fairness a few people, probably, and they'd best steer clear of Sega and Two Point Studios’ Two Point Campus when it launches later this year, because there’s going to be a canny few wizards kicking about being all magical. Two Point Studios have shown off a new trailer for one of the courses to expect when you arrive on campus, which has a lot of the potion brewing and casting of spells that you’d expect from even a magical academic establishment.

It’s a gaming laptop with specs, price and performance that are so straight down the middle of the road that they might as well be studded with cat’s eyes. Apologies in advance if this is not the most action-packed hardware review you’ve ever read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.
The game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.

Yet it also hints vaguely at what’s coming in Season 3 – now starting all the way off on November 8th, with the open beta for Forge from September. 343 cite “quality of life” lessons from Season 1, along with the sensible goal of maintaining team health, for the extension.

An odd choice, considering Shiro Games themselves downplay RTS elements in a Steam blog. Spice Wars is as much 4X as the dead eyes of two smiley faces, and one with enough forward momentum as to make such tantalising lies unnecessary. Embrace your grand strategy! It’s like John Dune always said: “Fear is the path to the dark side, Malcolm Reynolds”.

There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more.

We also caught up with Larian to chat about Baldur's Gate 3 (watch out for a dedicated video coming in the next day or two), and we capped off the day by attending Shirley "Skyrim Grandma" Curry's panel over on the Bumblebee Theatre stage. I'll be writing up a separate post about this in the coming days, but needless to say, Shirley was an absolute delight.

Now, everyone's favourite bomb disposal expert is back in McPixel 3 (solo developer Sos Sosowski prefers we never mention the likes of McPixel 2), which we got to see in action over at the Devolver booth at PAX East 2022. Sosowski took the reins for us in this demo, showing us exactly how not to save the world in this equally comedic sequel, proving that the McPixel formula is still just as potent ten years on from the original.

Moderated by Overclocking-TV.com's Isaïe "Trouffman" Simonnet with special guests Joe Gialanella from ModMyMods, Eric "hobbseltoff" Hobbs from PC Modding Enthusiast, and Justin "Robeytech" Robey, these four experts took us through the history of PC modding over the last 15 years, the highs and lows of some of their very own builds, and what lies in store for PC modding going forward. It was a fascinating panel, and we caught up with Simonnet afterwards to try and recapture some of that excellent hardware chat for you folks at home.

Instead of plonking ourselves in the middle of the empty show floor after hours, we snuck back into Devolver's booth to film our Friday catch-up, where we started our day some 10 hours beforehand. We got the lowdown on McPixel 3 from solo dev Sos Sosowski, and marvelled once again at the lovely overgrown arcade cabinets of reverse citybuilder Terra Nil. We then moved over to the Focus stand to play supernatural cowboy slayer Evil West and the ultra fast FPS Warstride Challenges. We also stopped by the Pinny Arcade communtiy meet-up today, and sat in on a couple of panels, including one about the history of PC hardware modding and a Wordle Royale. Find out exactly what that means in the video below.

It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.
It's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.

According to the patch notes, Monarch is the name of the organisation that tracks down these cryptozoological Titans. Somehow there have been two movies starring the big ape-lad and the large dragon with bad breath now, one of which came out last year. I guess this is a tie-in to that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox Software are making an “all-new” follow-up to Telltale Games’ Tales From The Borderlands episodic graphic adventure set in the Borderlands universe. It’s out this year, Gearbox revealed at this week’s PAX East event.


Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford – who stepped aside as head of Gearbox Software last October – dropped the existence of the project right at the end of the PAX East presentation while wearing some shockingly Borderlands-yellow chinos. You can watch for yourselves below. Skip to about five minutes from before the end if you’re just interested in the Tales From The Borderlands announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was out with friends once and a person who was a mutual aquaintance with a pal, and who did something or other in theatre, looked at a couple of us with sad eyes and asked "What have you been doing recently to give your life meaning?"
I think your reaction to the idea of someone asking you that will predict your response to Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between, a self-described "surreal journey through the spaces between places". Do you think "what have you been doing to give your life meaning?" is a cool way to start a conversation? A better prompt than you'd normally encounter? A big question, rather than small talk? Then you will probably be more open to the delights of Glitchhikers, a game where where you talk about choice and predetermination to what appears to be sentient windchimes while driving along a one-way motorway. Where you take a nighttime walk around a park peopled with meditating animals who have opinions about magic.

Larian’s CEO Swen Vincke didn’t make his usual armoured appearance for the announcement, unless you count his legs poking out from behind a desk. Get well soon, Swen. Larian have styled the release date announcement as a look back at Baldur’s Gate 3’s “journey so far” while it’s been in early access. It’s a bit daft, but neatly summarises how the game has evolved over the past two years.

In the latter category, first prize definitely goes to the trio of highly cursed doll babies scattered around the stand for Chernobylite, the post-apocalyptic survival horror roguelite that came out last year. They were also accompanied by two gas masks, casually strewn across the corners of TV screens, but nothing compared to the truly haunted look of these semi-melted plastic husks.

The 12700K is my personal pick of the new Intel 12th-gen family, as it offers the same number of performance cores and therefore much the same performance as the flagship 12900K - all while producing far less heat and costing much less too. It normally retails for around $385, but today a $45 discount code on Newegg brings it to just $340.
