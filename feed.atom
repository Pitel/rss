Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release.

Originally released in 2015, Touken Ranbu is a free-to-play browser game where players take up the role of a Saniwa who has the power to turn historical, mythical, and even a few imaginary swords into pretty boy warriors known as "Touken Danshi". The Danshi are mankind’s greatest weapon against the History Retrograde Army, a group of absurd-looking skeletal bugs that are traveling backward in time to change the course of history. As the Saniwa, it is up to you to protect the historical timeline by sending your Danshi back through previous eras of Japanese history to defeat them, even if it means restoring unquestionably cruel moments from the past.

Curious PlayStation fans are picking up tidbits left and right now that the new tiered PlayStation Plus plans are in effect in certain regions — namely, Asia markets, excluding Japan. In the Americas, PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium plans are launching on June 13, but we've got early info to glean about the priciest tier's classic PlayStation games. Continuing last week's story about Syphon Filter getting new trophies for PS4/PS5, other PS1 Classics have gotten full trophy lists, including Wild Arms and Ape Escape.
The trophy lists popped up today on the reliable trophy tracker site Exophase — and so far, everything has a platinum trophy. That said, not every PlayStation Classic will offer…]]></summary>

That heft is the conversation starter that helped Gloomhaven find the audience it rightfully deserves. It's a great board game experience that was recently adapted into an equally as notable turn-based tactical RPG for PC. And now developer Flaming Fowl Studios and publisher Asmodee Digital have plans to release this digital version on consoles in 2023.
Asmodee is working with Saber Games and Embracer Group on this console port. No specific systems are known at this time, but Asmodee's tweet announcing this project shows an image of an Xbox controller. You can see it below along with a teaser video for the console versions:

It’s said that even the best-laid plans often go awry, and that is fully evident in Mini Motorways. What starts as a pleasant city-planning simulation evolves into a frantic puzzle you must solve before time runs out.

When Tchia was announced at the Game Awards back in 2020, I immediately added it to my list of beautiful, relaxing games that I'm looking forward to. It's billed on Steam as a "tropical open-world adventure" which, as someone who loves all things sand and surf, is enough on its own to get me interested in learning more about the game. All of the other fun adventures the game promises, well, those are just icing on the cake.
Unfortunately, the game's developer Awaceb just announced that Tchia has been delayed to early 2023, so we're going to have to wait a little bit longer to embark on our tropical adventure. The good news is they did drop off a new mini-feature that highlights a key component of Tchia's gameplay: ocean exploration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQXFd4jn-mY
The short trailer shows clips of the titular character Tchia sailing around gorgeous tide pools, diving into the water in search of lost treasure, and even different customization options for the boat's sails and flags. Of all the open-world games I've played, Tchia looks to be the most relaxed and easy-going, which we can always use more of in an industry of titles focused so heavily on combat.
The news of the delay may not be ideal, but it does look like Tchia is going to be worth the wait. On top of the ocean exploration portion of the gameplay, we can also look forward to other fun mechanics like transforming into different animals and objects, climbing and gliding around the oceanside cliffs, and strumming on a fully playable ukulele.
We can definitely see the impact of titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey in Tchia, and I personally can't wait to see what new spin Awaceb puts on gameplay mechanics that we've come to know and love.
Tchia will be available in early 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team becomes the first union at a major U.S. studio
Raven Software quality assurance workers have now officially voted to unionize. The final vote came down 19 for, 3 against.
The vote was held today, over a webcast stream. The group, Game Workers Alliance, marks the first union at a major games studio in North America and one of only a few around, including Vodeo Games staff.
https://twitter.com/WeAreGWA/status/1528825165798223872
It's a big move, especially as The Washington Post reported that Activision Blizzard management had been discouraging employees from voting in favor of the union. A Bloomberg report from earlier today says that the National Labor Relations Board is preparing an official complaint unless Activision settles. An Activision spokesperson denied the allegations in a statement to Bloomberg.
A long road
It's been a long road for Raven employees, starting with sudden layoffs at the end of last year. Workers at Raven's QA department, which works on titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, held a walkout and eventually went on strike calling for worker representation.
The strike ended when the QA testers formed a union, Game Workers Alliance, under the Communication Workers of America. The union called on Activision Blizzard for official recognition.
Activision Blizzard did recently confirm it would be moving many of its U.S. QA workers to full-time positions. But the company also said it would not voluntarily recognize Raven Software's QA union, leading to today's vote.
The publisher has been the subject of acute scrutiny for some time now. A lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing kickstarted a series of lawsuits and reports.
Microsoft announced earlier this year that it plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Microsoft told The Washington Post earlier this year that it would "not stand in the way" of an Activision Blizzard union.

I wasn't sure what to make of V Rising in my first hour or so with it. The Steam Early Access survival game starts out just tasking you with making a vampire lord, rising from a coffin, and collecting resources. Crafting, scrapping, and surviving, it all felt familiar.
Yet the isometric world and grim, gothic setting kept giving me more and more Diablo vibes. Soon I had a castle and heart, some weapons and spells to work with, and a domain to call my own. And soon, I'd go on the hunt, and really see where V Rising would set itself apart for me. After putting in a handful of hours with V Rising over the weekend, I can absolutely see why players are so excited about its prospects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I do believe it is the role of company leadership to set a culture".
Early in April 2022, reports of poor working conditions at Nintendo of America surfaced, accusing the company and a third-party hiring firm of “concerted activities” and “coercive actions” to prevent unionisation, and the struggles of part-time workers and contractors to secure time off and decent pay.
On May 23rd, 2022, Washington Post games journalist Mike Hume spoke to Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former President of Nintendo of America, as part of Fils-Aimé's book launch — and several of his questions were on the topics of unionisation and mistreatment of temporary workers.

As cloud gaming continues to build out, one service provider is now bundling streaming games in for its customers. AT&T announced today that Control Ultimate Edition is free to stream in its entirety to a phone, tablet, or computer for AT&T customers.
According to AT&T's site, you just need a postpaid mobility plan. Then you can head to its Play Now site using a mobile device or computer. Enter your phone number and zip code for your account, and bam, Control Ultimate Edition.
It's available for a limited time, and powered by Google's Immersive Stream for Games. That program is a spin-off of Stadia, where companies can license Google's Stadia streaming tech for their own streaming purposes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UISRDU_mzaw
This isn't the only game available, either. Batman: Arkham Knight is also on the program, as it launched last fall.
Cloudy future
Cloud gaming has been an interesting technology to watch develop over the years. Stadia itself went through some woes, shuttering its internal studios and looking to expand in other ways.
A report in February indicated Google might be pivoting and adapting the technology, bringing the tech to services looking for streaming options. It certainly seems like this Control offer falls under that.
Other companies have tried out their cloud tech, too. Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming has made Xbox One and Series X|S games open for streaming through the cloud.
For AT&T, it's a very specific subset of users able to take advantage of this. But it is interesting, as a microcosm of where these options could go: mobile. Cloud options already feel largely targeted towards phones, as they make for capable and widely available streaming platforms. With a pack-in like Control Ultimate Edition, it's certainly a step to watch for future streaming developments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.
He's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like "Ram Grenade Down Throat," "Blow Opponent in Half," and "Fire Hole Through Opponent." The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.
I doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

Here are Game Informer, we loved Sonic The Hedgehog 2, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and while 2022 is void of much competition in the video game adaptation space, save for Uncharted, it’s one of our favorite video game movies in a while. Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well. 
While waiting for tomorrow, check out this story about the scrapped “Ugly Sonic” movie design that makes a cameo in Disney Plus’ new Chip ‘n Dale movie.

In an interview with TrueAchievements, former Eidos Montreal art director Jonathan Jacque-Belletête said the studio once worked on a version of the game.
"[Eidos-Montreal] brought back Deus Ex," he said. "I was the art director on that—Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Then [I was] the executive art director on Mankind Divided. Then we tried to do Final Fantasy XV. Then they decided to bring it back to Japan—which I think was a big mistake, but it's still the truth. Ours …]]></summary>

This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Although there are many (too many?) chances to get into Warhammer and 40K these days when it comes to video game adaptations, two upcoming titles, in particular, are really speaking to me: the first-person co-op game Darktide from Vermintide developer Fatshark, and Space Marine 2, a long-awaited action sequel. We'll see more of both of them shortly, as Games Workshop is putting together a Warhammer Skulls showcase on June 1.
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 are the showpiece games here — especially since they're new and they look cool — but the event will also cover the "latest updates and future plans" for some already released games, too. In its announcement, Games Workshop specifically pointed to Total War: Warhammer III, Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector, and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. We'll see what we get.
[caption id="attachment_323256" align="alignnone" width="1920"] That's a lot of logos![/caption]
When to show up
The Warhammer Skulls event will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday, June 1, with "week-long offers" and new game content to follow. You can catch it live on Twitch.
Even if you're only interested in seeing a new trailer or two, you may want to swing by for the wider showcase — Clive Standen (of Vikings fame) will be involved. (If you missed it, he's Captain Titus in Space Marine 2.) Considering how quickly our summer calendar is filling up, though, I don't fault anyone for being a bit more choosy with their time.
Darktide isn't too far off with a September 13, 2022 release date, but Space Marine 2 feels much less tangible at this point — Saber Interactive is still listing a TBA launch.
I'm ready to cull the hordes in both of these games. Where are you at with them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fighting game fans and brawler fans rejoice! The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. 
The four sets respectively are:
Ryu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off
Chun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance
Guile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength
Ken Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect

The two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. 
“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” 
This collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot Wheels Unleashed is getting some content soon featuring some looney new vehicles and tracks. In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.
A brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.
Hot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.
The Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules.

If there is one thing I’ve learned from the current era of pop culture, it’s that I shouldn’t get too attached to the characters and stories that entertain me and bring me joy. Because, inevitably, this world will find a way to ruin everything that we love. Whether it’s turning cinema’s most magical moviegoing experience into one of the stupidest film franchises ever, or stripping away all meaning from a beloved character so you can endlessly monetize them, there are no depths companies and corporations won’t sink to if it means squeezing out a few more nickels from their fans and consumers.
That’s why I honestly have no problem with something like MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighter from Player First Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Ente…]]></summary>

In a relatively low-key post from Pac-Man's official website to celebrate the franchise's 42nd Anniversary, it's been announced that a collaboration will launch between the classic Bandai Namco franchise and Epic's titanic battle royale game Fortnite.
According to the official post, 'items with the "Pac-Man" motif' will appear in Fortnite starting on Thursday, June 2nd. It sounds like this will be limited to apparel, meaning you likely won't be seeing Pac-Man himself trotting around the map.

In a surprise announcement last year, we found out that the highly acclaimed PlayStation RPG — also available on Switch, of course — Final Fantasy IX would be getting an animated show. Developed by Paris-based Cyber Group Studios, we've heard literally nothing since this initial reveal almost a year ago. But it looks like our patience is going to be rewarded.
Animation Magazine has interviewed the Vice President of Cyber Group, Bruno Danzel d’Aumont, ahead of the 2022 Licensing Expo in Las Vegas, where brands such as LEGO, Pokémon, Warner Bros., and more often make appearances. In the interview, d’Aumont says that Cyber Group will be sharing "the company's latest updates" during the show, and when asked about what new shows will be presented, one will be of interest for fans of Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner's journey in the 2000 RPG:

2022 game streams are on the way, and I use "E3" in quotes because really, we all know it's E3 in spirit, even if E3 doesn't exist this year. I mean, the ESA made its bed, but it's still weird to call it by any other name at the current moment. It's kind of like Facebook changing the name of the Oculus Rift to something I won't even mention here. I'm just not ready for change!
In the meantime, here are all of the confirmed dates and times for 2022 game streams. It's...a lot. While "E3 is canceled," we're effectively getting a more spread out E3: with all the good and bad that comes with that.
Expect this page to be updated when new 2022 "E3" and Summer Game Fest streams arise.
When the Summer Games Fest stream starts
June 9 - 2PM ET
When the Netflix Gaming stream starts
June 10 - 1PM ET
When the Guerilla Collective stream starts
June 11 - 11AM ET
When the Wholesome Games Direct stream starts
June 11 - 12:30PM ET
When the Future Games Show stream starts
June 11 - 3PM ET
When the Xbox and Bethesda showcase stream starts
June 12 - 1PM ET
When the PC Gaming Show stream starts
June 12 - 3:30PM ET
Remember, EA Play Live 2022 has been canceled

Capcom has been on a roll in recent years, with its top franchises like Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, and Street Fighter raking in the money for the publisher, resulting in its ninth consecutive year of operating income growth for FY2022.
For several years Capcom has been looking to "awaken" past franchises, and a leak in 2020 suggested that new Final Fight, Power Stone, Mega Man and Dragon's Dogma games may be in the works. During a recent Q&A session (thanks, VGC), Capcom was asked what its plans were for its more dormant IP, with the publisher stating “We are currently putting together plans for our pipeline based on-demand data from the market. Going forward, we will continue to take customers’ wishes into consideration while devising our title lineup.”

Nintendo's fascinating history continues to be unearthed by fans across the world. Just last year, 16mm film from Nintendo's Wild Gunman — originally a 1974 arcade cabinet before jumping onto the NES in the '80s — was discovered. 16mm film games use film reels and projectors to project photos and footage onto the screen. Now, footage from another 16mm game has been uncovered.

The game in question this time is Sky Hawk, a 1976 arcade game. This time, the 16mm film footage is of remote-controlled fighter planes, which you must shoot down. One game lasts 60 seconds, and if you shoot down eight or more planes, you get give a free game. Many haven't seen footage of this game at all, but YouTube channel Critical Ephemera has uploaded some never-before-seen gameplay of the long-forgotten shooter.

Roughly a year ago, it was announced that French animation studio Cyber Group Studios was deep into a Final Fantasy IX animated TV series. Now, according to Animation Magazine, it'll be debuting soon, in the hopes to be sold to a distributor.
Cyber Group will be attending the Licensing Expo in Las Vegas from May 24-26, in a bid to sell the show. It's here that we'll likely see the first screens or maybe even a trailer, as well as info on some of the characters (and potential newcomers). In 2021, the company noted that "for those who [don’t] know Final Fantasy IX, this will be an [introduction]...and for the many who [do], this will immerse them in a universe they’ll love."
At the moment, details are slim. The McFire Family, Gigantosaurus, and PressStart projects were all shown off: but we're waiting to see Final Fantasy IX at a later date. If you want to stew over what it could look like and the subject matter it could entail, you can peruse Cyber Group's catalog here.
To be clear, I don't think you should expect the moon here — or an epic series with adult themes. We already know it's aimed at kids, but their entire catalog is predicated on family viewing. As someone who does watch cartoons with their kid, I just hope it's nearly as good as Spidey and His Amazing Friends.

When I booted up Citizen Sleeper for the first time, it immediately enthralled me with its premise. Its dystopian transhumanist pitch – surviving as a digitized consciousness of a human body implanted into a robot designed to work for a mega-corporation – is refreshing in the cyberpunk genre of games. Its slick, clean, and unique art style, coupled with its score, a Tycho-esque take on sci-fi beats, told me I was in for a good time, assuming the gameplay would click. And at first, I wasn't sure if it was going to because its early …]]></summary>

The eShop itself, however, is far from great. With more and more games being added on a weekly basis, the eShop has gradually become slower to load, more difficult to navigate, and an overall pain in the bum to use since the Switch launched five years back.

        <updated>2022-05-23T15:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. 
Lost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. 


Before launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. 


At launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  
You can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.]]></summary>

Folks are being charmed all over again by both LEGO and Star Wars collectively, as many have collectively been taken in by a combination of nostalgia and LEGO formula mechanical evolutions in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. The High Ground Skywalker Saga mission has been patched, among a few other bugs that folks have been encountering recently.
In all, three missions have been fixed, all of which were either game-breaking or progress-halting bugs (two locked story completion, and one messed up the camera). The studio also technically added new content, as there are 34 new Kyber Bricks (collectibles) to locate throughout four new encounters.
Here are the full patch notes for the May High Ground Skywalker Saga update:
Numerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:
Issue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.
Issue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.
Issue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.
Implemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:
Fulminatrix
Home One
Invisible Hand
Venator
WB Games reminds folks to submit bugs here if they occur. Can we still submit them for Arkham Origins on PC?

Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

'Project' has been dropped from the name, and we now know the game is going to be called Trinity Trigger. The game will launch on PS5, PS4, and (most importantly) Switch on 15th September in Japan. When we'll get it in the West, we have no clue yet, but hopefully it won't be much longer after!

With ongoing consolidation occurring within the gaming industry, rumours of a potential Ubisoft sale continue to persist. Although the most recent reports suggest that the company is looking to block potential takeovers with a partnership of their own, the latest report suggests that Ubisoft may in fact be holding off until its share price increases.
According to Dealreporter (via GameIndustry.biz), the Assassin's Creed publisher is looking for its share price to reach at €60 to €70 before it considers any kind of buyout. Looking at a best-case scenario, it's been suggested that a share price of €100 would be the optimum level due to its long-term prospects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few minor fixes just came out
A new N64 on Switch patch was recently released alongside of Kirby 64, and some sneaky dataminers have managed to once again uncover some invisible patch notes. Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.
Over on Twitter, Switch "tinkerer" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled "version 2.3.0:"
Kirby 64 added
Star Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.
Dr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)
Mario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).
In short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, "Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks."
With that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.

And over on the Xbox side, you won’t find any new Marvel games developed by an Xbox studio because according to Ong, the company declined Marvel’s offer, opting instead to focus on its own IP, as reported by Video Games Chronicle.

Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

        <updated>2022-05-23T12:27:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service that combines Plus with PS Now back in March. Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. 
Funnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. 
As Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. 
Over on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  
While PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.

The Switch has some rather good free-to-play options, and June will add more to the ranks. On 1st June, as a reminder, Knockout City will be going free-to-play; developer Velan Studios (also well known for Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit) will also be parting ways with EA and taking on publishing duties.
The same date will also be the launch of season 6 for the game, and it certainly seems like a fresh opportunity for the multiplayer dodgeball extravaganza. We liked it a lot in our review, but there's also the inevitable reality that some of us will have fallen off it, or perhaps played the extensive free trial but then not taken the jump with a purchase. No doubt Velan Studios has looked to the free-to-play successes of games like Rocket League, and of course we also have Fall Guys going free when it arrives on Switch and Xbox on 21st June.

Reddit user Sagezu was flummoxed by the bug over the weekend and shared their woe at crashing out of Lost Ark’s first Legion Raid, Valtan, which arrived as part of the May update.

When fully in the grips of My Time At Sandrock, my little made-up computer game life is all I can think about. My relationships with real humans fade into the background, to be replaced by an altogether more fulfilling kind of relationship, one based entirely on gifting the same jar of honey to a cartoon character over and over again until they admit that they love me.

[Update: The Switch Sports towel is now live as a reward for 550 Platinum.]
My Nintendo has been ramping up its physical reward selection as of late, and the next one in line is a Switch Sports towel.
As revealed by a news post promoting the game, the new My Nintendo reward is slated to arrive soon:
"Spocco Square is a sprawling complex where all the sports matches are held! This towel is inspired by Spocco Square from the Nintendo Switch Sports game. Handy for keeping your head in the game, wicking away sweat, or cooling off during your next match or workout!"

The lead time from an announcement to a release for a My Nintendo reward varies, but generally it can be anywhere from one to three weeks until it's up for sale. Expect it to arrive in mid-May at the latest, most likely. Based on prior reward structures, it'll probably be around 500 Platinum or more: but the Japanese Switch Sports towel reward (which is a different design) is 400.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
There's free shipping on orders of $50 or more, and you can bundle cash products with the Platinum rewards if you want. You can also buy multiple My Nintendo rewards with Platinum and pay one flat rate shipping fee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends Mobile impressions
I’m old enough and self-aware enough to know that I probably shouldn’t play competitive online shooters anymore. And it’s not because they can be insidious with their FOMO skins and seasons. I shouldn’t play them anymore because I have an addictive personality when it comes to the genre. If any of these types of games find their way onto my consoles — be it Fortnite or Overwatch or Splatoon — I risk losing myself and my free time to feed the insatiable obsession that arises after just one match. I will seriously spend an entire weekend planted in front of my television playing these games like I’m a zombie who feeds on headshots if left to my own devices.
The only place I should experience these types of games is on mobile. Because while mobile shooters can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sugimori style
I can't let you get through the rest of your weekend without spotting this mock-up of a Pokemon game inspired by the watercolor style of Ken Sugimori's classic illustrations. It's a brilliant idea for a first-gen Pokemon Red/Blue/Green remake from artist @pokeyugami.
I'd be writing this article if the source was just an image, but it's a full-blown video:
https://twitter.com/pokeyugami/status/1527576053014618112
In the clip (via The Escapist), Red strolls through the forest as a few Caterpie and Weedle scooch by while a Bug Catcher boy stands guard, ready to show off his beauties.
On Twitter, a fan tacked on the Viridian Forest music for the full classic effect.
Not to tear down some of the official Pokemon remakes we've gotten over the years (most recently the chibi-ified Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on Nintendo Switch last year), but dang. This fan art is so wonderful. It's how adults like me imagined Pokemon as a kid.
[caption id="attachment_323124" align="alignnone" width="1920"] The original Pokemon fantasy.[/caption]
If you're on board, you should also check out some of @pokeyugami's other work on Twitter. I love this generation-spanning Gym Leader illustration, as well as this Professor piece. Their art combines the old with the new in a novel way.
What are the odds?
Just the other day I was thinking about another similar fan project — a custom Gengar plush with Sugimori-esque painterly detailing. There's a growing passion for this stuff among creators, and a riled-up audience of fans all ready to go, cash in hand.
With the power of nostalgia and the way trends seem to circle back around, I feel like it's only a matter of time before a real Pokemon game taps into this watercolor vibe.
What is it with me getting my hopes up as a once-die-hard Pokemon fan? I need to chill!

It makes it a lot harder. Hopefully, this weekend will definitely, finally be it, and next week I'll be broadcasting from a new location. Exciting! Scary af! How's the project going so far? Well, let's just say that nobody trusts anybody anymore... and we're all very tired.
Regardless, I hope that this week and weekend find you very well indeed. I hope that the next couple of days bring you happiness, rest, and relaxation if you are free from the doldrums of work and chores.

And now for something completely different. The retro enthusiasts over at Hamster have taken time out from the Namco party to offer up one of the most infamous oddities of the classic arcade era. Straight out of Data East and into your hearts, it's Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released in arcades in the spring of 1990, Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is a delectably daft crossover beat-'em-up that stars characters from Data East's catalog, as well as some familiar, non-sequitur stages and even some iconic works of art. Players guide one of three heroes through incredibly strange side-scrolling action — fighting cities full of ninjas, monsters in the rainforest, giant robo-guardians, stacks of animals, and even the fire-breathing Data East veteran, Karnov. This is not to make mention of the moped-riding zombies, disembodied unicorn heads, or the player's enviable final form of... a sheep.
Check out the wacky antics in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.

While Trio the Punch is hardly the most playable or enjoyable of classic side-scrolling actioners, the title has long cemented its place in video gaming history simply due to its nigh-on incomprehensible nature. The game does not offer any insight whatsoever in regards to plot or reason, and most on-screen text is just poorly translated (or simply garbled) gibberish. It's just a whole lot of nonsense, charmingly released as the arcade market truly started to find its feet with polished, well-produced, sensical video games. Among its contemporaries, Trio the Punch was batshit anarchy, and for that, it will remain curio in the video game hall of fame.
Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at $8.

The games industry is flooding with cozy, impossibly cute life simulators right now, and as a massive fan of the genre, I personally could not be happier. Titles like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have left an obvious mark on the market, proving time and time again that gamers are craving a simpler, sweeter life. Next up in the long list of simulators is Little Witch in the Woods, and it's looking like a real contender to stand out among the competition and be one of my favorite games of recent memory.
Little Witch in the Woods may have just entered early access, but it's already been garnering a lot of attention on Steam and Xbox (it's also playable with Game Pass).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9QHk2A6yg
Players take on the role of Ellie, a young witch who takes it upon herself to collect items in the forest and help out her neighbors. Ellie also teams up with a sentient witch hat named Virgil, and works to hone her craft as an apprentice witch, an element reminiscent of Kiki's Delivery Service (which is unsurprisingly one of my favorite movies, go figure).
Early reviews say it's very similar to Stardew by way of gameplay, just with a witchy theme about it, and there's not much else you could say that would make me want to play this game more.
The developer of Little Witch in the Woods, Sunny Side Up, is reportedly very pleased with the response to the game so far, and are continued to update players. They say that the plan is for the game to get a full launch in 2023, and to add two more story chapters and an ending in addition to the prologue and first chapter that are currently available to play.
It sounds like they have a lot more game to make, but knowing that fans are already falling in love with the project so far has to be an amazing motivator. Godspeed, Sunny Side Up — we can't wait to see what else you have in store for us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regal Replica
One of the contributing factors to the enduring appeal of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lies in its introduction of many mythical new characters to the Zelda universe. And for those of you besotted with the underwater kingdom of Zora, First 4 Figures might have a treat in store for you.
The merch-maker has offered a first look at a brand new figurine capturing the beautiful form of Zoran princess and Champion of Hyrule, Mipha. The PVC figurine stands roughly nine inches in height and is delicately poised with her formidable Lightscale Trident. Mipha's ethereal presence and compelling beauty belie her adept combat skills and overwhelmingly courageous nature, reflected in her subtle stance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGeIxpNMoMo&t
Mipha stands atop a sturdy circular base, emblazoned with the symbol of the secretive "Shadow People," The Sheikah. The base features LED lighting effects, which light up her royal highness with a delectable aqua blue glow. The Mipha figurine will look mighty fine standing on anyone's bookshelf, and will make an even better accompaniment to F4F's previous releases of Princess Zelda, Revali, and, of course, Link himself.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mipha figurine is available to pre-order now from the official First 4 Figures website. Mipha will retail for around $150 USD on release, but those who pre-order now can bag an Early Bird price of $137.99, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Mipha is expected to ship in the fourth quarter of 2022 and payment options are also available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. 
Unlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Not that long ago, I was out here publicly wishing that Wario Land 4 would show up on Nintendo Switch Online as my one true hail-mary GBA pick, and I'm still trying not to get my hopes up. Admittedly though, my attention is better spent on Antonblast, an upcoming PC and Nintendo Switch indie platformer that taps into the dearly departed series' vibes.
Antonblast is already winning over fans on Kickstarter, who have pushed past the game's baseline $75,000 goal on Kickstarter with a month left in the crowdfunding campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's an arrr-PG
Bandai Namco is showing a bit more of the battle side of its upcoming One Piece Odyssey. The role-playing game based on hit manga One Piece is launching sometime this year, and it certainly has some RPG systems in place.
When the new One Piece game was first revealed, it definitely had some RPG vibes. Some new screenshots from the Japanese One Piece Odyssey site (as spotted by RPG Site) really emphasize just how it's tackling battles, though.

There's HP and TP, as well as a weapon triangle of sorts. There are definitely some Persona vibes to the UI elements here, and I think they actually work pretty well.

Another screenshot, shown above, also highlights some positioning mechanics. It looks like range and position on the field will be important too.
Other screenshots show different members of the Straw Hat Pirates using their various abilities to navigate the environment. From slicing a gate in half to seemingly flying across the map, it looks like overworld traversal mechanics will play a role too.

Straw hat life
I am, admittedly, not a huge follower of One Piece. I've dug other Shonen Jump series like Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia, but never taken the dive on One Piece, due in large part to just how lengthy it is. My backlog is already gigantic.
That said, these screenshots are making a pretty good case for checking out One Piece Odyssey. While anime spinoffs usually veer into fighting games or other action-oriented formats, RPGs are relatively unexplored territory. Bandai Namco seems to really be going for a full-on RPG with One Piece Odyssey though, with screenshots more evocative of Persona and the Atelier series.

No firm date's been set yet, but One Piece Odyssey is due out sometime this year for PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The little PlayStation mascot that could
The next PlayStation character to get a Nendoroid is none other than Astro from Astro Bot Rescue Mission and Astro's Playroom, and that goes to show how far this mascot has come.
I mean it! We were talking about Good Smile Company's figure for Aloy (of Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West fame) just a few days ago. And now here's the humble little bot, looking like a champ. When's the next game? There's got to be another one.
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1527487300283801610
Good Smile Company is taking pre-orders, and you'll have until June 29 to partake. The Astro Nendoroid costs $63.99, and it's aiming to ship in February 2023, but as Siliconera points out, these things have a tendency to slip. You'll need some patience either way.
Aside from the default face, Astro also comes with swappable "dizzy" and "smiling" expressions, as well as accessories: a fuse, a PlayStation coin, and laser feet.
I love this design as is, and it's a natural fit for the Nendoroid line, but one thing is missing. Imagine if they recreated some of the collectible PlayStation console "artifacts" from Astro's Playroom. The pack-in PS5 game was such a nostalgic, nod-filled collect-a-thon.
The Astro Bot figure is so cute and pure, I feel guilty for neglecting Astro's Playroom — a game I got all of the trophies for but admittedly haven't thought about much since the PS5 launched. I should download that again (you can never have enough free space...) and try to improve some of my times. Or maybe I'll just pop back in to soak up the jams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conclusion to the first season of Master Chief's TV adventures is finally here, but did it stick the landing or continue to frustrate us? Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.


The regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.
In episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that "Transcendence" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.
When looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.
Thank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. 
What do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

Release:

Fueled Up is a four-player couch co-op game set in space announced last month and the first trailer had us convinced it would make for some chaotic, and great, co-op sessions. We couldn't help ourselves so we reached out to Fireline Games to ask if we could play it and they said yes. And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!


As you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. 
VIDEO
Enjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. 
For more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month. For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Diablo Immortal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, MultiVersus, Bear And Breakfast, and more.

BattleTanx was 3DO’s first N64 game and a pretty decent success for a company that was trying to pivot from their failed hardware endeavor. As 3DO would soon prove, they were crazy about franchises and sequels. It’s not surprising that BattleTanx would be up for a new entry the very year after it launched.
Creative director, Michael Mendheim, was nice enough to humor some of my questions about BattleTanx, so it seemed natural to also pivot to its sequel. Here’s the thing: even though he’s credited as creative director for BattleTanx: Global Assault, he wasn’t heavily involved in its design. According to him, “My involvement in BattleTanx: Global Assault was mostly just pre-production just to make sure nothing went off the rails.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The delay train keeps on rolling. In a week that saw Kerbal Space Program 2 and Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown get pushed to 2023, one of the year’s promising indie titles won’t be arriving in 2022 either.
Tchia was first announced at the 2020 Game Awards and unfolds on a beautiful island inspired by New Caledonia. Players control a young girl with the magical ability to inhabit the bodies of animals as well as inanimate objects, such as coconuts. Exploration involves sailing to different tropical islands in an open ocean as well as climbing through forests and soaring across the landscape on a glider. The game last appeared at the 2021 Game Awards where it got a 2022 release window.

May 20, 2022
Developer Awaceb posted an update on Twitter explaining that it needs to delay the game to tinker on it further, saying in part “this extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience.” 
Tchia is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. You can catch up on every big game delayed to next year here.]]></summary>

The film also includes insight from professional shooter players and industry experts as they unpack the genre's origin, evolution, and impact on the industry and pop culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019. Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. 
It seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. 
Death Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo announced in February that it plans to discontinue Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases in March 2023. However, the sunsetting process gradually rolls out throughout 2022. The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.
If you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  
Keep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. 
As a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge.

Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. 
While this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.

Issue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.
Issue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.
Issue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.
Implemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:
Fulminatrix
Home One
Invisible Hand
Venator
As you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect. 
While waiting for this patch to download, read Game Informer’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review, and then check out our guide of codes to unlock additional characters in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Check out these awesome new Star Wars dioramas recently debuted by Lego after that.

Incoming From Bend Studio:

May 19, 2022
Bend Studio announced in a tweet today that Syphon Filter is going to come packed with trophies to obtain when it releases as part of the upcoming PlayStation Plus expansion. The tweet reads, "Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus." The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called "An Explosive Start." A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name "Excellent work, Agent."
With the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.
PlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.

Most of them come out of Summer Game Fest, Geoff Keighley’s annual onslaught of livestreams and world premieres, but there are a few non-Keighley branded streams taking place as well. To help you get a grip on what’s going on and when, we’ve compiled all of the announced presentations with dates, times, and a brief description of what each entails.

Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.
Capcom is no stranger to live service games, nor do they lack experience in seasonal content. Street Fighter V had plenty of both, with four seasons of new characters, plenty of costumes, and new stages. N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new collection of indie puzzle games released today aims to give a broad and gentle introduction to many puzzling subgenres. Wrapped up in that idea that they're all pulled from a mysterious alien games console, CosmOS 9 packs nine games that are each meant to take 30-90 minutes. I've played a few and they seemed puzzle game staples, having me drawing paths through blocks, figure out how a mysterious computer interface worked, and such. See the breadth of the cosmic puzzling experience in the trailer below.

        <updated>2022-05-19T17:00:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. 
Marvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. 


“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” 

At launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. 

Beginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. 
In regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more.

The delayed new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be released in Q4 of 2022. 
Back in April, CD Projekt Red announced that it had taken the development of a new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in-house and that as a result of this shift, the update had been essentially indefinitely delayed. Following reports that the delay was in "development hell," CDPR put out a notice that this was not the case and now we know that the new-gen update will be released sometime in the final three months of this year.

Player First Games is well on its way to releasing its fighting game MultiVersus, a new multiplayer platform brawler that pits the extensive list of characters from the Warner Bros. catalog against one another in chaotic button-mashing battles. It's easy to compare MultiVersus to other fighting games in the genre, like Nintendo's juggernaut Super Smash Bros., but after spending a handful of hours throwing fists, kicks, and lasers with the WB crew, there's plenty that impressed me about MultiVersus that makes it stand out, and should be a game to …]]></summary>

What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they're not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?
Because of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying 'egg' a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew's life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.
The game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.


Like the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. 
The studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. 
The first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.]]></summary>

Mikami established Tango in 2010 after nearly two decades at Capcom, directing games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4, and a few years contracting for Platinum Games, where he directed Vanquish. His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.
“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry. When you’re in your 30s, you have the right balance – you’re energetic and have your ego a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: 
New Game Announcement!
pic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK
May 18, 2022
As you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. 
Elsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. 
In the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aloy is the star of Horizon Forbidden West – one of the best games of this year – and will soon shrink in size to forever be preserved as an adorable Nendoroid action figure. Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.
Along with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.
If you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures. Overwatch's Junkrat and D.Va, Bayonetta, and Hades' Zagreus are just a few of them that you can grab. You can find more about Aloy at Good Smiles' official site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. 
The long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: 
“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” 
To soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. 
Nacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles." You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. 
Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. 
2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.
On May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. 


As players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. 
Roller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. 
Roller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

All of this is to set up and say that if you’re looking for what a hardcore Warcraft fan thinks of the series’ first venture into the mobile space in Warcraft Arclight Rumble, I’m not your guy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Intel’s recent takeover of the RPS best gaming CPUs guide wasn’t indication enough, their latest 12th Gen Alder Lake chips are the real deal – especially on pure games performance. This should make the newly launched Core i9-12900KS, in a way, the realest deal of all: it’s structurally identical to the Core i9-12900K, originally the top-spec CPU in the series, but made with an even more discerning binning process. A component of the highest quality components, if you will, and as such can brush past the Core i9-12900K’s maximum boost clock speed of 5.2GHz to reach a scorching 5.5GHz.

It's currently going for $1799, a $601 drop from its MSRP of $2400. That's still a lot of money, but it's a great deal on a flagship-grade gaming laptop.

Maybe you're actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship's load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

Escape Rooms have become all the rage over the last decade, but the pandemic has put a damper on the in-person experience. Escape Academy brings the concept home, expanding the concept into a broader adventure set in an unusual university. 
You control a new student enrolled at a school dedicated to training escape artists. Nearly every room, floor, or corridor of this institution hides a puzzle or three, and very little is what meets the eye. The same extends to the eclectic faculty, including a mysterious headmaster.

But this week, in the name of experimentation, I'm trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can't imagine many will think this good, let's give it a go, for science. Tell me, what's better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like "Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble," and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like "cops", "switch car" and "plan", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout.

While the site returned, it never reached its old highs again and staffers lost their motivation along the way.

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

To others, I might say it's "similar to Crimsonland or Nation Red." Either way, it's a top-down survival shoot 'em up about blasting through Lovecraftian horrors using your trusty gun, levelling up to get magical perks and powers, and yes, grabbing a load of XP gems. A free demo is out now, and I'm enjoying it.

Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama.

I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria's pop goths and Latvia's song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that's the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PCIe 4.0 drives are coming down in price fast, and nowhere is this more evident than with Ebuyer's recent sale on the WD Black SN770 2TB drive. It normally costs £190, but this has dropped to £170 today. That's an awesome deal on a high speed PCIe 4.0 drive that works on both PC and PS5 and hits the current sweet spot for bulk storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While fads come and go, mech games continue to simmer pleasantly away without ever taking over or going away. The latest one I've finally made some time for is Ignited Steel Colon Mech Tactics, a turn-based tactical game with a light sprinkling of FTL.
Despite appearances, it's quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren't quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It's a good time.

Pétursson is hardly the first person to profess an affection for Paul Verhoeven’s cult military satire. But he is one of the few with command of his own company of science fiction game developers. For well over half of Eve Online’s existence, he has led CCP in an effort to create the perfect spin-off shooter - stubbornly chasing the dream of a playable Starship Troopers, even as those brave young prototypes have been cut down by unimpressed players, one after the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.
