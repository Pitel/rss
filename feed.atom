        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD are looking to wring the last few GPUs out of their RDNA 2 architecture, ahead of the RDNA 3-powered Radeon 7000 series launching later this year. They’ve just announced the Radeon RX 6650 XT, the Radeon RX 6750 XT and the Radeon RX 6950 XT: slightly faster, but more expensive and power-hungry refreshes of the RX 6600 XT, RX 6700 XT and RX 6900 XT models. These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.

However, I was hit with reality: he doesn’t yet have his own video game, and that’s a shame. 
Sure, he’s appeared in franchises like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Marvel vs. Capcom, and more – he’s even set to be one of the main protagonists in the upcoming Marvel’s Midnight Suns due out later this year – but if you want to experience a Strange-centric story akin to something like Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, you’re out of luck.

They know an important message is to follow, and that everybody in voice chat needs to hear it. Often, when Michael Pusateri is in a work meeting at NBCUniversal that’s going sideways, the same comms command enters his head. "Check, check. Shut up, everyone."


“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

Publisher Raw Fury and developer Fury Studios have announced the next entry in the Kingdom series, but with a very different vibe.
Kingdom Eighties will still be a strategy game like its predecessors, but instead, the game shuns the Medieval aesthetic for something a bit closer to home — the 1980s. The teaser doesn't give much away, though it's clear there are a few nods to Netflix's Stranger Things and movies from the decade such as E.T. and Disney's Tron.

Today brought us the May Monster Hunter Digital Event, which unsurprisingly was dedicated to the upcoming 'massive expansion' for Monster Hunter Rise - Sunbreak; it launches on 30th June. The headline part of the broadcast was the flashy new trailer (above) that set the scene for some further details.
An announcement that stood out to us related to Sunbreak having all-new 'Follower Quests'; these are single-player only and involve you heading into battle accompanied by story characters. They'll pitch in and help, with each having distinct fighting styles; they'll even behave like human players and ride monsters, for example. It seems like an enjoyable way to experience some extra storytelling, and in addition to follower quests with characters from the new Sunbreak hub (Elgado), there'll also be some of these with Kamura residents from the base game, such as Hinoa and Minoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the successful launches of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars: Squadrons, Electronic Arts is finding its place in a galaxy far, far away. Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind the Jedi title, is overseeing production for three different Star Wars games: a strategy title, a first-person shooter, and a sequel to Jedi.
I don't know what to expect from the first two games, but I expect Jedi to be a direct sequel that reunites fans with protagonist Cal Kestis, who is still trying to find his place in a troubled time with the Empire on the rise. If Respawn goes in this direction, here's what I hope to see:
The Light and Dark Side of the Force
Force Turmoil
A Gruesome Death for the Poncho
Play as BD-1
Larger Environments
More of the Same with the Lightsaber and Fighting
A Connection to The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian show, but I didn't expect to see one from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars fans believe BD-1 was in the show, meaning he's been around for over twenty years. How awesome would it be to see BD-1 return to that location and show us why he was there in the first place?
And now I'd like to hear what you want to see from Respawn's next Jedi game? Do you want Cal back? Would you rather have someone else in his place? If so, who? Also, if he does return, where do you think his story goes?]]></summary>

The second collection of Nippon Ichi / NIS America RPGs, Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 2, is out today in North America on Nintendo Switch. To celebrate, NIS has unveiled a launch trailer to show off all of the crazy tactical combat, over-the-top special moves, and variety of gameplay systems on offer.
The collection features two classic Sony-released games from NIS' back catalogue — 2005's Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome, now known as Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound, and 2010 PSP game Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman. While the former is a more traditional (for NIS America) tactical RPG, the latter mixes in some roguelike elements for an extra dash of randomness. Because these games' colourful characters aren't enough on their own!

Today, Capcom held a digital event covering plenty of new content coming to the big DLC release.
The event began with a new story trailer, focusing on the cover monster Malzeno, who, with a horde of tiny vampiric monsters, drains life from the environment and captures other creatures. Malzeno has a history of devastating the kingdom of Sunbreak's new character Fiorayne and will continue to be a problem for hunters in this expansion. It can inflict a new Bloodblight status which drains health and forces the blighted hunter into "a bat…]]></summary>

He's also dead – in open-world action RPG Gotham Knights, at least. "Gah", was my initial reaction, but that's changed to "Oh well" having seen 13 minutes of new gameplay footage showing Night Wing and Red Hood stick it to some thugs. What about four-player co-op? Nope, sorry; it's confirmed only to be two-player, as that's what Batman would've wanted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new statue might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. 
According to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: "While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, "The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. 


Of course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that it will be hosting an Indie World Showcase tomorrow. 
The showcase will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, and it will run for roughly 20 minutes. As the name implies, the games showcased will be indies, so don’t expect to see the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or anything like that here. However, if it’s like the most recent Indie World Showcase that aired in December, we could be in for some indie treats. 
Tune in May 11 at 7:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on upcoming indie games headed to Nintendo Switch. #IndieWorld

May 10, 2022
That December showcase came with the release of Chicory: A Colorful Tale on Switch, a new look at Sea of Stars, and several game reveals, and it was a great time. Hopefully, tomorrow’s 20-minute presentation lives up to that.  As you might have guessed, fans are already preparing their ritual circles in hopes that Hollow Knight’s sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong, makes an appearance, just as they did ahead of the last Indie World Showcase. Naturally, there’s no word on if Silksong will make an appearance tomorrow, but it’d be a great moment if it did appear. 
While waiting for tomorrow’s showcase, catch up on everything announced in the December Indie World Showcase, and then read Game Informer’s list of our most anticipated indie releases for 2022. If you’re looking for an indie to play today, be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 indies to play right now.

Publisher Happy Juice Games has announced the upcoming launch of a brand new point-and-click game for Switch: Lost in Play. It's an homage to Saturday morning cartoons that looks to deliver a feel-good adventure that will make players nostalgic for their childhood. It's described as a cross between Alice in Wonderland, Monkey Island, and Hey Arnold!, so if you're a fan of the classic Nickelodeon cartoon, this might be one to keep an eye on.
In an effort to make the game as inclusive as possible, the developer has opted to exclude spoken words, instead using actions and visuals to communicate instructions to the player along with the narrative. The game will launch on Switch this Summer for $19.99/€17.99/£15.49.

In the results, Nintendo calls Pokémon a first-party franchise, which some might not consider true since Game Freak, an independent party, develops most of the Pokémon games. However, Nintendo invests heavily in the franchise, and Pokémon games have always been released exclusively on Nintendo consoles. So, it’s hard not to call it a first-party franchise. On that note, Pokémon was Nintendo’s most successful property in the fiscal year that began in April 2021 and ended this past March.

We love a good documentary here at Nintendo Life, and CREATORVC's upcoming film, First Person Shooter, looks like it will fill a big gap in our lives. Shooting for a Q4 2022 release, this 3+ hour documentary is all about the genre's rise. Ahead of its release later this year, CREATORVC has shared a six-minute snippet with IGN which looks at how id Software first decided to make its first FPS and one of the most pioneering and influential games of all time, Wolfenstein 3D.
Anyone who knows anything about Wolfenstein 3D knows that on its native DOS it's bloody and brutal, which wasn't exactly a perfect fit for Nintendo at the time. Still, because the game was such a hit, Japanese company Imagineer contacted id Software to make a Super Nintendo port of the game. And Nintendo was less than happy with the violent content of the shooter.

Nintendo's latest financial results demonstrate strong sales for the Switch, despite a 20% drop YoY as a result of semiconductor shortages. With a total of 107.65 million Switch units sold, the console is inching ever closer to the lifetime sales of the Game Boy and the Nintendo DS.
Just to highlight its success even further, Switch hardware sales have now surpassed Wii U software sales. That's right; as pointed out by the Nintendo Life alumni and all-round good egg Jon Cartwright on Twitter, there are now more Switch consoles out in the wild than there are Wii U games. That's wild.

Nintendo has taken the opportunity with its annual financial results to make some notable business moves, even if they're little to do with the games we get to play or the systems we own. In addition to a planned share buyback, the company has announced a major shift to its shares / stock structure with a '10-to-1' split.
First of all, let's look at what that means. On 30th September Nintendo will 'split' every share into 10; so, if you own 10 shares in the company they will become 100 shares. The overall picture means that Nintendo will go from having an approved issuing of 400 million shares up to four billion, multiplying by 10.

Despite being a different take on the Pokémon formula, the brand itself is infectious — as are those glowing reviews, of which we have one of our own — but over 12 million sales between its 28th January release and 31st March is a heck of a lot.

The Switch-led successes for Nintendo over the last five years have enabled the company to once again generate significant profits and enhance its already impressive cash reserves. While investment has clearly gone into game development, will continue in terms of hardware R&D, and of course into major collaborations in areas like theme parks and the upcoming Mario movie, the company has also used its cash wealth for some other accounting and financial manoeuvres.
In August last year the company outlined plans to spend up to $900 million buying back shares to then 'cancel' them, a move to adjust the balance of company finances and investments. In today's annual financial results a similar plan was outlined, though there is a key difference in the focus.

After the dizzying highs of the 2020/2021 financial year, the most recent financial results from Nintendo show an expected but relatively modest drop following the pandemic / lockdown-related boom. The results are still very strong, yet we're now into the sixth year of the Switch generation; as such Nintendo is forecasting an upcoming year of declines to match the older hardware.
First, let's summarise the key figures for 2021/2022, with percentage indicators in brackets for how they compare to the previous financial year.

Despite this, Nintendo reports that sales of the Switch has decreased by 20% year-on-year, with the company citing "shortages of semiconductor components and other parts". It also singles out Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a particularly high driver of sales during the last fiscal year, something that Nintendo has arguably lacked in more recent months.

Nintendo has just published its latest financial report, and one of the biggest highlights of it is seeing the total sales figures for the company's most popular games. And there are no newcomers or big surprises here.
Once again, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is at the very top — will it ever not be? — having sold 45.33 million units since it launched. That will likely continue to grow as the Booster Course Pass is expanded. Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate still sit at second and third with 38.64 million units and 28.17 units sold respectively. It feels like very little will catch up to Mario Kart or Animal Crossing with over a 10 million difference in sales between third place's Ultimate and the cuddly life sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is a bit of a weird one. Originally conceived as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the next JRPG from Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama, this smaller, more action-focused RPG has become both an official prequel to Hundred Heroes and a kind of intermediate stop-gap designed to tide players over until the main event next year. Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A mixed intro to the world of Suikoden's spiritual successor.
Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, a spiritual successor to the legendary Suikoden series of Japanese role-playing games, blew past its funding goals on Kickstarter two years ago, raising a whopping 4.5 million USD and shattering all its stretch goals in the process. It’s safe to say that many have a strong appetite for the kind of game director Yoshitaka Murayama creates, which made it all the more bothersome when Hundred Heroes, like many crowdfunded projects before it, was delayed – this time until 2023.
Enter Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, a spinoff/prequel that promises to tide us over until the main course (although there are question marks over whether it will make it to Switch at all). However, if you’re looking for a JRPG, look elsewhere; Rising trades Hundred Heroes’ turn-based battles for a side-scrolling action adventure steeped in town-building mechanics with a little Metrodvania thrown in for good measure.

Electronic Arts is known for creating blockbuster games based on series like Star Wars, but it's also worked with plenty of other famous IPs in the past. One, Nintendo gamers from the 2000s might recall, is Middle-Earth's The Lord of the Rings series.
Now, many years later, the games giant has announced it is returning to the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien with a new game. The catch is it's a free-to-play mobile title, but hey - who knows what else could be released later down the line...

Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.
As spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development. According to Broussard, he has no idea how the footage resurfaced but shot down hopes of a complete, playable build by describing these demos as a “smattering of barely populated test …]]></summary>

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). 
But somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought.

As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. 
That performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 4525 days since James Cameron's Avatar was released in theaters, decimating box office records, and today, the trailer for its first of many sequels dropped online. 
Avatar: The Way of Water rejoins Jake Sully (in his now permanent Na'vi body) and his partner Neytiri over a decade after the first film's events. According to the film's description, the two now have a family with kids of their own, and The Way of Water is the first of many new stories to chronicle "the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure." Previously we got to see how the Na'vi live and thrive in the lush jungles on the planet of Pandora. This time we see how they fare on the coast, in the oceans, and of course, in the skies above it. The humans are still around, too, and look to be up to no good with armed Na'vi or Avatars in their ranks.
The trailer, which you can watch above, has plenty of grandeur, drama, and action. It brings back memories of how gorgeous the setting of Avatar is, and the last shot of the trailer shows Cameron hasn't forgotten how to make a cool action sequence. He is responsible for Terminator 2 and Aliens, after all. If I wasn't sold on the idea of more Avatar before the trailer, seeing Jake surf into the skies on a flying crocodile with a huge gun in hand and an ax on his back was more than enough for me to buy a ticket when presales go live later this year. 
Avatar: The Way of Water stars Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, and Kate Winslet. It will be released in theaters on December 16, and yes, there will be a 3D version.
Are you excited about Avatar: The Way of Water? Did you remember that Ubisoft is working on an Avatar game set for release this year? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness hit theaters Thursday and it’s doing quite well for Marvel Studios, scoring the biggest opening in 2022 thus far and claiming the 11th best domestic box office opening of all time. Critically, it’s been more divisive than one might guess, with many either being put off by how "Sam Raimi" the Doctor Strange sequel is or completely smitten with it as a result of the Evil Dead director’s style. 
If you’ve seen the movie, you’ve likely noticed how unique it is in the pantheon of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. It features more horror elements than ever before, and it introduces a lot of new concepts and ideas to the MCU. In fact, I think Multiverse of Madness sets up where the MCU is ultimately going later in Phase 4 and beyond. To speak any furthe…]]></summary>

Following its predecessor's footsteps, Salt and Sacrifice hits a similar 2D Soulslike feel. After perishing in the opening moments, your character becomes Spellmarked, an entity that treads the line between life and death by the power of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE 2K22 may be the current hotness, but some fans are still enjoying the online offerings of WWE 2K19 or 2K20. Unfortunately for them, that will soon come to an end. 
The WWE Games Twitter account tweeted that on June 30, the online functions for both of those games will be shut down. 2K explains that doing so allows the team to give its full attention to supporting 2K22. Once the shutdown occurs, 2K19/20 players will be unable to play online, download/upload user-created content, or interact with presumably any other feature dependant on the servers.   
📣 Attention WWE 2K community: On June 30, 2022, we will sunset support for WWE 2K19 & WWE 2K20 servers. This includes all online functions, such as online matches & Community Creations. We are turning our full focus toward supporting #WWE2K22. Thanks for your continued support! pic.twitter.com/vOJ06AA9iy
May 9, 2022
While 2K20 is largely remembered as a disaster, 2K19 was generally well-liked, but both games haven’t exactly maintained bustling online communities. The average Steam player count for both games currently sits between 90-130 players, so it’s easy to understand why 2K would feel justified in sunsetting online support.
Furthermore, WWE 2K22 garnered positive reviews (here's ours) and recently received the first pack of DLC wrestlers of its months-long roadmap. On paper, it behooves the team to bolster a game perceived as a relative return to form with updates as much as it can. It's undeniably a bummer to lose such a big function of the old titles for preservation purposes, if nothing else, but at least fans have plenty of time to squeeze in some online match-ups before the final bell tolls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the moment PlayStation 5 was announced, fans have been asking for a Bloodborne remake or remaster. Now seven years old, Bloodborne is one of PlayStation 4's greatest games, showing developer From Software can do terrifying and exciting things within a gothic, Victorian setting. Summer is always a hotbed for video game announcements, and even without an E3 this year, the rumor mill is spinning at full force, teasing massive games that we may see revealed in the months ahead. One of those games is Bloodborne. If you asked me if I wanted a Bloodborne remake or remaster before February 25, 2022, I would have screamed, "YES!"
Ask me this question now, and my answer is a bit more low-key but still a "yes." When I played Elden Ring, I expected big things from one of gaming's most consistent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m testing an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti this week. No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?


“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp. But the best graphics cards aren’t huge as a rule, and when it’s got to the point where new GPUs can’t easily fit into a standard mid-tower PC case, it might be time for some course correction.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

        <updated>2022-05-09T14:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotham Knights might feature four-player co-op, if an updated PlayStation Network Store listing for the game is to be believed. 
Gotham Knights, which lets players control either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in a Gotham without its Batman, has marketed co-op as a feature since its reveal back in 2020. However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. 
As you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. 
Perhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. 
For more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

Titled The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth, this game is a collectible role-playing game that brings the fantasy of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings to a “strategic, social-competitive experience” on mobile devices.

Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

If you fancy yourself an old-school TMNT fan, then Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is likely one of your most anticipated games. The upcoming title takes the blueprint of classic brawlers like Turtles in Time and shines it up for an original adventure that feels better than the old games ever did. I should know because I played a demo of Shredder’s Revenge and walked away even more excited for the full release.
The demo let me battle the Foot Clan across the game’s first two levels: the Channel 6 news station and the streets of New York City. I’m now intimately familiar with these stages, given …]]></summary>

Sentinel, the next expansion, is no different. It launches on May 13th and will introduce new items that follow you around and make the enemies around you stronger - and the rewards for killing them greater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hearthstone Battlegrounds is but a few days away from a major shakeup. On May 10, Blizzard will be releasing pats 23.2, which includes the significant Rise of the Naga update for Hearthstone's auto battler. With it comes a new hero, Queen Azshara, and a brand new minion keyword called Spellcraft that gives the player temporary spells out of thin air each turn to buff their team of minions. 
Speaking of minions, a new race of creatures will be coming with Rise of the Naga, and it will, of course, be the Naga themselves joining the fray. No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. 

Since Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.
How much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you excited to play around with the Spellcraft mechanic? Let us know your thoughts on this big update in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale's The Walking Dead: The Final Season brought a sense of closure for Clementine in video games, but her story is apparently far from over and is continuing in comic books. We got a small taste of her next adventure in a 12-page short story in the comic book Skybound X, and now, if you run out to your comic book store today, you can see what happens next for absolutely free.  Each year, retailers celebrate Free Comic Book Day by giving away dozens of comic books from various publishers for free. One of this year's books is Clementine: Issue One by publisher Skybound Comet and Eisner and Ignatz award-winning writer and artist Tillie Walden.
This free book is surprisingly lengthy, giving readers 27 pages of Clementine's next story, as well as an interview with Walden. This story leads into Clementine: Book One, a graphic novel that releases in June. Here's the official product listing from Skybound for the forthcoming book:
Clementine is back on the road, looking to put her traumatic past behind her and forge new path all her own.















	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










If you run out to your comic shop today, make sure you also grab Marvels Judgement Day and Spider-Man/Venom, as well as DC's Dark Crisis. All three of these books serve as preludes to big events in both universes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After two weeks of great episodes, the Halo series takes a huge step back during "Inheritance," the seventh episode of the Paramount Plus episodic adventure. Join us on The Game Informer Show as we break down and spoil the highs and lows of Kwan and Soren's journey and quickly touch on our thoughts on last week's episode, as well.


The regular crew of Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are all back and, unfortunately, have bad news to deliver to fans of Master Chief, Cortana, and Dr. Halsey. "Inheritance" features none of those characters or the exciting storyline on Reach with the discovery of the actual Halo ring. Instead, we head back to Madrigal and the ongoing adventures of the reformed Spartan and his rebellious counterpart.

Developer Retro Forge announced that Souldiers will miss its May 19 launch and now arrives on June 2. The delay gives the team additional time to iron out some lingering technical kinks, with creative director Alberto Hernández writing in a press release: 
Souldiers is perhaps best described as a 16-bit amalgamation of Metroid exploration, RPG progression, and Souls-like combat. As either a scout, caster, or archer, you’ll battle across a fantastical land that sits on the border between life and death. You can watch the original announcement trailer here to see it in action. 
You can play Souldiers on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Jill Grodt on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

The Statik Selektah produced track is titled “Come Get Some” and features the vocal talents of Method Man along with PXWER and iNTeLL. In a nice touch, the beat samples Joseph LoDuca's original Evil Dead score. The song will presumably appear somewhere in-game, but you can listen to it now in the video below or seek it out on your streaming app of choice, including Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music.


Evil Dead: The Game is our cover game for the month of May. The asymmetrical multiplayer title pits four players in the roles of Ash Williams and his allies against one player-controlled demon. It launches May 13 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Your Devil May Cries and your God Of Warses are the obvious reference points for describing Ultra Age, but it doesn't really feel like them, and I don't think it's trying to either.
The basic idea is that you're stranded on a jungle planet full of industrial ruins, and have to fight through robots and huge animals in small groups, switching between several (kinda samey) swords as needed. It's not really doing anything spectacular, but it's enough of its own thing to feel like more than just a budget God Of Cries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: The views of the author of this piece do not reflect the views of the entire Game Informer staff. 
Build-A-Bear has revealed that you can now buy a plush of Grookey, the best Generation 8 Pokémon starter (easily and undeniably), in a new online exclusive bundle. 
This news comes by way of the official Build-A-Bear website, which reveals Grookey is now available to ship in the U.S. and U.K., as reported by NintendoLife. The bundle, which will cost you $65, includes a Grookey plush, of course, with a sound chip that includes the Pokémon’s cry, a matching “Leaf Shirt,” and a “Leaf Cape.” It’s basically a Grookey plush with a Hawaiian shirt on, and it looks awesome. 
“Get into the groove with Grookey,” the site’s description of this bundle reads. “This friendly Pokémon is sure to always stick by your side. The curious Grookey is a Grass-type Pokémon with green fur, large eyes and ears, and a curly brown tail. Pokémon trainers will love this exclusive Grookey plush toy bundle, which includes Grookey’s leaf print shirt, matching cape, and 5-in-1 sound chip.” 
There’s a limit of five of these bundles per customer, if you want to get close to having a full team of Grookey plushes, and Grookey as a plush cannot be purchased individually. If you want the plush, you have to buy the bundle online that includes the shirt, cape, and sound chip. 
As previously mentioned, Grookey is very much the best starter in Pokémon Sword and Shield, and you can read our thoughts on those games in Game Informer’s Pokémon Sword and Shield review. After that, read about Gen 9, which was recently revealed as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. Check out every confirmed Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet so far after that.

The game first launched for PC in May 2020, and it puts you in the boots of a courier and photographer living in a futuristic city facing a world-ending crisis. As everything you know begins to fall apart, you’ll capture photos of these final moments to complete objectives and unfold the narrative. Thanks to various lenses, filters, and effects, you're allowed a degree of artistic freedom in how the final images turn out. The game has received critical praise, and we recently included it as one of the most intriguing photography games worth looking at. 


What makes this version special? It contains the base game and its Marco story DLC, additional modes, plus every quality-of-life update since launch. 
Umurangi Generation Special Edition comes to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on May 17 and costs $24.99. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now the most successful video game movie of all time, at least by box office numbers, in the U.S. (although it’s easy to argue it’s also the best movie adaptation of a video game, too). 
Having now earned more than $331 million at the global box office, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now one of the highest-grossing video game movies of all time. Funnily enough, it took this record from the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie, which held the record after earning $319.71 million in box office sales back in 2020, according to a press release.

The video was originally captured for Noclip’s 2020 documentary about the history of Arkane, the studio behind the much beloved Deathloop and Dishonored series. Ravenholm did feature, albeit briefly, in Noclip's original documentary, but now Noclip producer Danny O’Dwyer has decided it's time to show off a bit more of it, interspersing his gameplay footage with some critical context for what’s going on and the ideas behind it.

The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TennoCon, the annual convention and celebration for all things Warframe, is unsurprisingly happening again this year. Digital Extremes, the developer behind the action MMO, will be holding the show on July 16.
On its website, Digital Extremes announced the show's timing and that it will once again take place virtually, promising an "all-day event packed with exciting reveals from the team at Digital Extremes." Despite having to watch the festivities from home, fans of Warframes can still participate in the big day by submitting to the Community Art Showcase. "Sculptures, drawings, digital art, Captura pieces, cosplay and more — we want to see it all," says the submission form for the showcase. Clans can also show off their group's home base with the Dojo Showcase.
Digital Extremes will also be donating to a Canadian charity that has yet to be determined. The company says it will announce the chosen charity at a later date.
At last year's TennoCon, a big cinematic solo quest called The New War was revealed, which was later released in December of 2021. Digital Extremes also announced the development of crossplay and cross-save systems was in the works, though these features have yet to hit the Warframe client as of the time of this story.]]></summary>

A much-requested bundle of items known as the C.O.R.E. Defender Pack is returning to Call of Duty: Warzone in celebration of the Call of Duty Endowment hitting a landmark milestone in helping veterans find jobs outside of their military careers.

Activision Blizzard has committed even more funding to the cause to commemorate the occasion, promising to inject another $30 million into the Call of Duty Endowment.

Keighley first announced the event’s return in March, almost immediately after word of E3 2022’s cancellation made the rounds. Summer Game Fest begins at 11 am Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern, including a live kick-off show. 
It's official: #SummerGameFest will have a big live showcase event on Thursday, June 9, streaming live everywhere at 11a PT / 2p ET / 6p GMT.@geoffkeighley hosts a cross-industry showcase with announcements, reveals and more! pic.twitter.com/iANNRxrgRj
May 5, 2022
In addition to streaming everywhere, Summer Game Fest can be watched live in IMAX theaters for the first time. Tickets go on sale sometime next week. The new partnership extends to Keighley’s other big event, The Game Awards, which will also be presented in IMAX this December. 
Surprise! On June 9, you can watch #SummerGameFest Live in @imax!

Naturally, Keighley hasn’t announced what games will appear at the show, but the IMAX trailer montage featured upcoming games such as Starfield, Sonic Frontiers, Star Wars Eclipse, and The Callisto Protocol. Before you get too excited, that footage may only be for the sizzle reel and not indicative of what will actually be shown.
E3 may not be happening, but the summer gaming event schedule is beginning to take shape. Double Fine and Iam8bit’s indie-focused Day of the Devs kicks off on June 9, The Tribeca Games Spotlight airs on June 10, and the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase was recently confirmed for June 12.]]></summary>

Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.

Live today, Patch 1.13 brings with it a ton of fixes not just to quests, but to general things like the game’s UI and some of Aloy’s animations, as well as improvements to the game’s performance and stability. Perhaps the biggest issue is the aforementioned visual shimmering, which has been a player complaint since launch. 
For the uninitiated, the shimmering is an almost glitter-like effect that appears on the edging of objects, robots, and more in Horizon Forbidden West. It makes things in-game look shinier than intended and in most patches since the gam…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-05T13:55:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neill Blomkamp is helping Gunzilla Games write the narrative for its next game, Off The Grid. 
Blomkamp, perhaps best known for directing movies such as District 9, Chappie, and Elysium, is helping Gunzilla shape the story of Off The Grid, which the studio is calling a cyberpunk battle royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter. Calling it “2.0” makes it sound like the studio is aiming to revolutionize the genre, but of course, that remains to be seen. However, you can get a glimpse of Off The Grid now thanks to a new teaser trailer released today. 


“Dive into the heat of a covert corporate war in Off The Grid, a cyberpunk Battle Royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter where you shape the story and the gameplay,” the teaser trailer’s description reads. “Unfolding on a dystopian tropical island, OTG sends you on a head-spinning assassination and sabotage missions to the greater glory and market share of your chosen faction. Tool up for 2023: it’s about to get bloody.” 
As you can see, Gunzilla is aiming to release the game in 2023. 
Off The Grid seems like a great match for Blomkamp, especially considering many of his movies have focused on the relationship between mega-corporations and consumers. 
“The approach is to try to inject the story in a way where players have the option of engaging straight up in the battle royale or have the option of diving into story and story missions, almost like a campaign that you would be playing to follow a story narrative,” the director told GameSpot. 
He says the three different organizations in the game – the factions that Gunzilla is staying mum on for now – are fighting over a space elevator located on the battle royale’s island. This elevator leads to an asteroid mining operation that has created a lot of wealth, which is why so many of the elite are interested in gaining access to it. Blomkamp elaborates more in GameSpot's interview so be sure to check that out here if you’re interested.

“Fall seven times, stand up eight,” says Trek to Yomi’s hero, the orphan-turned-samurai Hiroki. The line represents not only his caricature-like perseverance, but something players should take to heart if they want to reach the end of this journey. However, I wasn’t always sure seeing the finish line was worth getting back on my feet. The eye-catching art direction can’t hide the title’s lackluster gameplay, empty characters, predictable story, and antiquated design. Indies are typically fertil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trek To Yomi is a stylish side-scroller of a samurai slasher, with an aesthetic that'll have you mashing the print screen key at every corner. Like a seasoned ronin, the combat is clean and refined. The story is simple and elegant. The visuals are straight out of a classic samurai flick. But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits! The lack of enemy variety hurts what could've been a sensational hike - but it's still a trek worth embarking on if you break it up with a few pitstops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive shared its plans for Year 2 of Hitman 3 back in January, revealing the Elusive Target Arcade, a PC VR release, plans for the World of Assassination Trilogy to hit Xbox Game Pass, and a new mode called Freelancer. 
This new mode was set to release sometime this spring but in a new update released by the studio today, Freelancer has a new target window: the second half of 2022. IO Interactive says it sees Freelancer as “the next evolution of Hitman and an entirely new way to engage with the world and characters” it’s built in the World of Assassination universe over the last seven years. Due to how “expansive and involving” Freelancer is, the team says it needs more time to work on it.

The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

Well, the game’s development team have taken to Twitter to announce that Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time Remake will be delayed indefinitely, which seems oddly fitting considering the game is about messing with time. It was meant to launch this year, but the game’s already been delayed indefinitely once before.

Not so, says Gilbert. On the subject of his previous comments, he says "None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech G502 Hero is the most popular gaming mouse on the market, not to mention the RPS reader's choice and our current 'best gaming mouse overall' - so it's exciting news that it's going cheap on Amazon UK today. 
£29.99 is the cheapest we've ever seen this mouse, beating out last year's Black Friday price, and it's also 63% off its UK RRP. That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. 
If you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year.

Like a shorter Black Friday, this can be a good opportunity to pick up some PC gaming hardware at severely slashed prices, so if you’re currently weighing up a new SSD or replacement mouse then it may be prudent to hold off until the event gets underway. And you might not even need to shop at Amazon for it, as some rival retailers like to run their own deals to compete with Prime Day directly.

He is not my favourite character in Citizen Sleeper but he is the one who best represents it. In one scene he explains his deep anti-capitalist reasoning to you. Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.
Throwing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run. Even when the game's own systems of dice and clocks clash with its stories of human interest, it is the people who come out on top.

Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through. There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.
There's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding your niche can often be the key to success for smaller developers, but Swedish team Image & Form refuse to be pigeonholed. Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

I'm not a fan of most fighting games. All too often they have too many elaborate moves, too much memory testing, or they feel like glorified puzzles you have to figure out the one solution to.
Hats Are Not Allowed takes an approach I find far more interesting. Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can't say it's one of the best dueling games ever, but it's the best one I've played for ages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle royale spinoff and subtitle collector Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt launched this week , following a delay to address feedback from its early access phase. That included ample reports of performance issues, but fortunately, what I’ve played over the past couple of days points towards a much more stable brand of last-vamp-standing shootery. Let’s take a look, then, at Bloodhunt’s PC performance, system requirements and the best settings to tweak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[QA contractors working directly on the next Dragon Age with BioWare Edmonton have filed to unionise, just the latest in a string of such decisions affecting high-profile companies throughout the industry. The workers are employed by the internationally-operating contract services company Keywords Studios but contracted out to BioWare. They’ve now formed the KWS Edmonton United group and have named low pay and concern at being instructed back into the office while Covid-19 remains a danger as their reasons to seek collective bargaining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford’s Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It’s mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don’t need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you’re greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won’t see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you’ll have to go elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take chess, reduce one side to only the king, fill him with a terrible wrath, hand him a shotgun, then watch him go. That's Shotgun King, a roguelikelike turn-based shooter where units (mostly) move like chess pieces, only our lone king has a shotgun. It might sound like a throwaway joke game but Shotgun King is an interesting and fun challenge, especially when your upgrades also bestow different buffs upon the opposing army. And it has a free early version so you can have a go yourself.

So Newcastle isn’t the Newcastle that's been in the Apex Legends backstory for ages, yet he is Newcastle. How does that work? Well, Jackson Williams is Newcastle now. He just wasn’t always.

The RTX 3080 Ti offers comparable performance to the RTX 3090 while costing far less, and today there's an OC model available at the card's UK RRP. It's an Ventus 3X OC model from MSI, with a hefty triple-slot thermal solution that ought to keep the card cool and quiet even running at its factory overclocked 1695MHz. 
To get the discounted price, use code SAVE75 to knock a healthy £75 off the list price. That brings it down to £1054, just £5 more than the UK RRP and a great deal for an OC model. You also get free delivery, with the card slated to arrive just after the upcoming bank holiday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, the dev duo that make up Analgesic Productions , seem to make games about scientists. Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a year in early access, Rogue Legacy 2 has born a 1.0 heir, and it's a game I've become well-acquainted with over the last few days. They're a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they'll flower into a roguelike that you won't be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it's something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.
