        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several hours of battles, sieges, imprisonment and torture in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a groggy Henry of Skalitz is woken by a servant girl in a castle outside Kuttenberg. She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

How to get Cursed Techniques in Jujutsu Odyssey

Cursed Techniques in Jujutsu Odyssey work a lot like Fruits in Blox Fruits. You find a Cursed Womb, consume it, and then gain the power. As you can imagine, finding the item (Cursed Womb) that gives you the Cursed Ability is the tough part. You can find them out in the wild, you can get them from defeating bosses or raids, and, as you can probably gue…]]></summary>

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

Even when the IP was in limbo, people kept making awesome mods such as the fully open-world and sandbox Call of Chernobyl. Though STALKER 2 hasn't had anything like that up until now, that's all changing.


As strange as it may sound, none of the STALKER games have released with a proper, full-featured sandbox mode. Sure, Call of Pripyat had post-campaign content if you played your cards right, but that was an exception to the rule. In fact, even STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has an actual point-of-no-return, which came as a big disappointment to yours truly in particular. Thankfully, the STALKER modding scene knows that this game's true value lies in free-form sandbox goodness, and so the first …]]></summary>

Some are strong, others weak, and some are useful only in certain situations, but if there's one thing we can say for sure, is that Jujutsu Odyssey takes full advantage of this. After you finish the first few quests, you get the opportunity to join a Clan. Of course, some Clans are better than others, and in this Jujutsu Odyssey Tier List, we will tell you which ones we think are worth pursuing. 


Tier List


For this list, we'll only cover the top-ranking Clans. If you don't see a Clan on this list, it either means it's not in the game (yet), or we didn't think it was powerful enough to make it.

Even though the genre has recently become more populated with games like Humankind, Old World, and Endless Legend—all of which are great, by the way—none have reached the same level of gameplay that Civilization offers.


Realistically, that's to be somewhat expected. After all, Sid Meier's Civilization is a series that's been around for over three decades with the original releasing all the way back in 1991. Over the years, developer Firaxis Games—and Micro Prose, back in the 90's—continued to build on and refine the 4X formula leading up to the series' seventh mainline entry, Sid Meier's Civilization 7.

This year, the main reward is the Bouquet emote, allowing players to offer an obscenely large bundle of roses to another. If you want to get this emote, or any of the other items available this year, we’ve got you covered.

To get the Bouquet emote for your collection, you’ll need to complete the quest that makes up this year’s Valentione’s Day event. It’s a pretty straightforward quest that won’t even require you to leave Gridania.

Cursed Techniques, in simple words, are the specialization skills that you gradually unlock upon leveling up. While there are some terrific options available at launch, you'll need to unlock them first before you get to equip any. That said, let's take a look at how you can obtain the different Techniques in Jujutsu Odyssey.

To get Cursed Techniques in Jujutsu Odyssey, you'll have to get something called Cursed Wombs. These wombs, in turn, will allow you to unlock new techniques from the skill tree after you absorb them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But wait, there's more!
44 years after its release, you'd think that the speedrunning community would have pushed the Donkey Kong arcade game to its limit. But, as it turns out, there are a handful of extra levels hidden behind the game's long-assumed unbeatable kill screen. All you've got to do is beat it.
That's the challenge that was recently undertaken by Super Mario Bros. speedrunner Kosmic. In a 29-minute YouTube video, the Mario pro explains that Donkey Kong's US arcade release (the one used for competitive play) maxes out at the first barrel stage of level 22. This comes as a product of a glitch in the game's bonus timer algorithm, where the game will prematurely end after just 400 bonus points have passed — nowhere near long enough to make it all the way to Pauline at the top of the tower.

In this case, it seems that someone had the thought: "Hey, why shouldn't the Tyrants from Resident Evil get to play in the Commonwealth?" And lo, they did create Reign of the Tyrants, a mod for Fallout 4 that does just that.

It kind of makes sense, when you think about it. I mean, much of the Fallout universe is built on the idea of a post-apocalyptic society that's awash with radiation a-plenty. Given the mutated state of RE's most brutish antagonists, it stands to reason that they should fit quite nicely into the Lo…]]></summary>

The only thing that beats it is Tetris, which has been out for way longer, anyway. But it's still pretty mind-blowing that a small indie game that began as a one-person passion project could go on to dominate the gaming landscape, with a legacy that endures more than 15 years on.




It almost feels a bit passé to still be talking about Minecraft, given its well-documented and enormous success. It's like asking whether you should still play Super Mario. Most gamers, even ones who haven't played it, are already well aware of what Mojang has contributed to the gami…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Odyssey could become the next major Roblox hit from the sphere of anime-based games, and the game already has an official Trello board, along with an active Discord community.


The new launch went live earlier on February 2, 2025, and it draws a massive amount of inspiration from Jujutsu Kaisen. While the Trello board will serve as your go-to guide for information, the Discord server will help you bond with fellow players.


How to join Jujutsu Odyssey's official Discord


Joining the official Discord server is pretty easy, and all you need is a Discord account. Once you've created your account (or signed into your existing one), just click on this link. You'll be able to access all the channels that are present on the server.


The Discord community will be your go-to hub for everything related to Jujutsu Odyssey. This includes participating in general chats with fellow players and being on top of the updates. There's already a dedicated channel for updates, and expect to find a lot of new information in the days to come.




How to follow the official Jujutsu Odyssey Trello


The Trello board's purpose is to provide you with any and all information related to Jujutsu Odyssey. You can visit the Trello board by clicking on this link. There are different cards present on the board to provide you with all the information you might need.


Unlike the Discord server, you can't send any text or add any information on the Trello board. It has a view-only status for all users, but you won't need a Trello account to check out the information. New cards are expected to be added here in the coming weeks once we get new content in the form of future updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ye to the walls, pikefolk of PC gaming. We've had a languid and fattening winter with a quiet game arriving here and there to peddle its wares. But the calm times are coming to an end. The big releases now march towards us in droves. But they do not know what lies waiting for them in the moat. The slick scales of the Maw surface in the moonlight, groaning, waiting, sick with hunger for fresh releases. The battle is yet to start, but we will upturn the chumbucket of news into the water below. Feed it, for heavens sake. FEED THE MAW!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The season of Valentine's Day has begun in Dig It, and you can find different gifts to obtain.


These gifts are exclusively part of the limited-time event that centers around Valentine's Island. The island will be available for a limited time, and you can find 23 different items while digging. Along the way, you can obtain different types of gifts as well, so let's find out how to obtain them.


Best way to obtain Gift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies in Dig It


As I said, Valentine's Island has 23 new diggable items for you to find. The Gift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies are on the same list, which means you can dig them up as well. Do note that they can only be dug up while the event is live, as Valentine's Island isn't a permanent POI in Dig It.


There is another way to obtain the three gifts, but that involves spending real-life cash.



The Gift of Enchants cost R$149.


The Gift of Hearts cost R$499.


The Gift of Skies cost R$699.



You can use Robux, but I believe that you should try the free way first (digging on the island and hoping to get lucky).




Gift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies contents in Dig It


The Gift of Enchants can now be opened inside the game as we are past February 2. The Gift of Heats can be opened on February 5, while the Gift of Skies can be opened on February 8. Thankfully, we already know the contents of all three types of gifts.



Gift of Enchants: Contains a Legendary rarity Mole.


Gift of Hearts: Contains a shovel


Gift of Skies: Contains an Air-Balloon



If you're confused about all the items that can be found on Valentine's Island, make sure to check this guide out. Remember that the island has been added for a temporary period, so you should hurry and get the complete set of items before the island disappears.

Many developers nowadays have taken great care to tell a great story, often sneakily taking inspiration from actual literature to fuel their incredibly rich works. Let's look at some of the best games you didn't know were influenced by books, shall we?

Both styles are pretty effective when it comes to their in-game abilities and moves. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them, followed by their respective showcases.


How to obtain Otoya and Karasu Styles in Blue Lock Rivals


Both items can be obtained by spinning, and it will largely come dow to your luck. Click on the Style option at the bottom of your menu, and you'll be able to try for the new Styles. Of course, the outcome is always going to be luck-reliant, and there's no way to guarantee the two new Styles.


Between the two, the Otoya Style is easier to obtain. This is largely due to it being an Epic-rarity Style, while Karasu is a Legendary-rarity Style. The…]]></summary>

        <updated>2025-02-02T14:16:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest update of Anime Adventures has introduced the Assassins Contracts Event inside the game, and you can earn different rewards from your grind.


The event has its exclusive token currency, which will help you unlock all the available rewards. The highlights are the new units that are exclusively part of the Assassins Contracts Event. To unlock them, you'll have to earn as many event tokens as possible.


Best ways to farm Assassins Contracts Event tokens in Anime Adventures


The Assassins Contracts Event can be accessed from the main screen of Anime Adventures. You'll find the event icon on the right side of your screen. Once you click on it, you'll find different contracts that are open. These are objectives that you'll have to complete to get the rewards.


You can also create your own game, which can be played with a stranger or exclusively with your friends. Ideally, it will be better to complete the harder contracts as they will offer you better rewards. However, make sure to take on objectives that are feasible for you to complete.




Best ways to use Assassins Tokens in Anime Adventures


To earn Assassins Tokens, you'll have to complete the objectives. These tokens are best used on the event-exclusive banner, which has its own set of limited-time units. Additionally, we might get new items in the shop in the future that will be purchasable using these tokens. Either way, I genuinely feel that using the currency to summon new units will be the best use.


The shining lights of the event banner are the three featured Mythic units: Somber, Killstreak, and Legendary Assassin. If you manage to get lucky and pull a Mythic, there's a 33% chance for one of the three to spawn. There's the usual pity rate as well for those who won't get the rub of good luck.

While it’s endlessly enjoyable to run around with familiar characters, it only gets better when you drag a friend along with you. 


Playing with friends in Island Adventure comes with a long list of benefits, as well as some rewards that are only available through multiplayer. This isn’t anything new for anyone who has played on Apple Arcade prior to the Steam and Nintendo Switch release on January 30, but if you’re new on any platform, here’s how multiplayer works and everything you can get for simply playing with a friend.

If you ever thought monasteries were just devoted to worship, feasting abbots, and choral chants of Ave Maria, The Stone of Madness is set on proving you dead wrong.
This is The Game Kitchen’s first foray into the stealth-tactics genre (a distinctly Spanish obsession we discussed with the devs last year) after the team's stellar work with the Blasphemous Metroidvanias. Two separate campaigns take place in an imposing 1800s Pyrenees monastery, which doubles as an insane asylum. This mountaintop prison offers no redemption, nor escape from earthly woes, for five luckless inmates aiming to escape, or destroy, their captors.

The new location has been added as part of Update 1.6, which went live earlier on February 1. Players will be able to visit this POI and try their luck to find all the new items. To do so, they will have to discover it first, and it's a pretty easy thing to do.


Valentine's Island location in Dig It


The Valentine's Island location is pretty easy to reach from the spawn position. Of course, the name of the island won't be available in the database until you visit it for the first time. Just head straight with a boat, and you'll find the new POI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of creatures you can catch in Fisch, but landing the secret fish is the hardest task to complete.


So far, there are six secret fish that can be caught inside the game, but they can prove to be stern tests. These six creatures are the hardest ones to catch, and they're not even part of the official bestiary. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them inside the game. Originally, there used to be three of them, but the recent Atlantic and Orcas update have doubled the numbers. 


How to catch all six secret fish in Fisch


As of the latest Oil Rig/Orcas update, there are six fishes to catch.


Fish
Type
Location
Preferred Bait
Season
Weather




Banana Fish
Secret
Ancient Isle
None
Summer
Rain


Long Pike
Secret
Ocean Territory
Insects
Autumn, Spring
Rain


Mustard Fish
Secret
Ocean Territory
Sea Weed
Summer
Rain


Resin
Secret
Mushgrove Swamp
None
None
None


Ancient Kraken
Secret
Atlantis (Kraken's Pool)
Truffle Worm
None
Night


Ancient Orca
Secret
Ocean (Arch)
Shark Head
None
None






The greatest difficulty of getting the secret fish is their spawn rate. They're not part of the official bestiary, which means that you're not supposed to find them inside the game. The Banana Fish, for example, is only meant for admins and partnered content creators. Yet, you might get lucky and land one with the correct setup.


Thankfully, you don't really need the very best rods to land them. You should fully focus on Season, Weather, and Bait, along with the locations. The odds of landing these fish are low, to begin with. Without the preferred setup, it will be next to impossible to catch these creatures, irrespective of your rod and player levels.

Let's take a look at how you can finish the full set and the rewards that you'll get in return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card in Ultimate Team. 


This is the first time that Ekitike has received a promo item with double playstyle+. To play with the card, you'll have to complete the challenge before the SBC expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at how you can finish the SBC with the cheapest possible prices. 


EA FC 25 Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC tasks


The Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC has only three tasks, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - Top Form 



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 86



Task 3 - Bundesliga



Min. 1 Players from: Bundesliga


Min. Team Rating: 87



EA FC 25 Hugo Ekitike Future Stars SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest Future Stars promo SBC.


Task 1 - Top Form 



Any 10 85-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - France



England 82


Tapsoba 83


Shaw 86


Diaby 83


Alexander-Arnold 86


Pajor 87


Mac Allister 86


Kimmich 86


Bruno Fernandes 87


Grimaldo 86


Xhaka 86



Task 3 - Bundesliga



Bruno 85


Pajor 87


Daly 85


Rice 87


Lavelle 87


Palhinha 85


de Jong 87


Popp 87


Bernardo Silva 88


Bruno Fernandes 87


Gundogan 87



With an overall rating of 89, Ekitike could have been rated higher. The SBC costs almost 200,000 coins, but that's likely due to the inflated market. The card has some really strong aspects. It has two playstyle+, which includes Rapid (one of the best choices in the current meta). He has three role++ as a striker and has great playstyles.


With 96 Pace and 90 Dribbling, he will be extremely up top, but you'll need to boost his finishing stats. If you have the fodder to spare and a Bundesliga-based squad, this Ekitike item could be a really underrated option to consider.

We get it — not everyone enjoys celebrating their birthdays, even milestone birthdays. But look, Nintendo, how on earth could you not celebrate your 100th birthday?
Well, according to former Nintendo artist Takaya Imamura — the man responsible for the designs of F-Zero, Star Fox, and art director for Majora's Mask — Nintendo completely glossed over its centennial anniversary. He shared this during an interview with 4Gamer (thanks to Time Extension and TheGamer for highlighting this) on the upcoming video game adaptation of his manga series, Omega 6: The Triangle Stars.

Thankfully, with a new report from Kotaku (thanks, Push Square) accompanying an intriguing tease from EA itself, it looks like The Sims and The Sims 2 will be re-released on PC very soon. The catch? Well, according to Kotaku's sources, it seems as though a console release is still "unclear" at the time of writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

Square Enix has announced that Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition will be temporarily unavailable on the Switch eShop starting 1st February 2025.
Worry not, though, because it doesn't sound like it'll be gone for very long. In a social media post from the official Dragon Quest account, its reasoning behind the temporary removal is quite simply so it can "make some minor updates to the store listing".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros' licensed free-to-play fighting game MultiVersus - aka, the one where Velma Dinkley and Arya Stark can team up to kick Superman's face in - will no longer be playable online as of 30th May. It'll be pulled from Steam, the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation and Xbox stores at the end of its next season, though you'll still be able to get your fill of Bugs Bunny bashing offline against either friends or bots.

But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke "all roadmaps lead to Rome".* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the "double pumped" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors. Here is a fresh look at the AVX-512 performance on a Supermicro server with an AMD EPYC 9655 processor.]]></summary>

It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about.

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

Between spring and fall of 2024, illegal subscriptions increased by a record 25%, with an estimated 700,000 households now regularly paying to pirate. The government considers a 'viewing ban' for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

In brief, it's a VR collaboration between D&D traffickers Wizards Of The Coast and Demeo studio Resolution Games that aims to simulate a tactical co-op tabletop experience without any of the boring bits, like seeing your mates' genuine reactions to things or having your frigid digitised soul warmed at the hearth of human kinship. Here is - in a sense of the word so loose I fear imminent smiting by a bellicose scribe god for typing it - a trailer:

You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nintendo lawsuit filed last November targeted video gamer Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru. Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk?

Then a few hours ago, a pair of Oscar-nominated movies, each with the same unusual feature, made their surprise entrance online.

The latest reminder being Snow Town Geek Store, a shopkeeping sim brimming with 2000's non-tude. Like the 2000's themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing last week's Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don't act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by PC Gamer, one Crastinator-pro has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South.

Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

"The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few games place me so betwixt the yin and yang of frustration and flow state as Snow Riders. Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarf Fortress's Adventure mode - a procedurally generated campaign that lets you approach the famously dense colony sim like a more traditional roguelite - is now out as a free update on Steam. The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of extended wordery on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

This time, the playlist includes a familiar geometric hazard that has seen the death of many a bean: the "hex-a-gone" level from Fall Guys.

From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. More importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to shore up the Treehouse finances following several staff departures, I'm announcing a new line of official Maw spin-off products. Presenting: New Viscous n' Delicious Mawflakes! The ultimate cosmic breakfast cereal, available in all the colours of the rainbow plus 666 others that aren't fit for human eyes! Simply pour over molten ichor and leave to stand - you'll know they're ready to eat when you can no longer hear yourself weeping. "Ready to eat" is a phrase that cuts two ways, of course - and what better way to accompany being eaten by Mawflakes than by reading about this week's new PC games.

While I've still got a pavlovian response to anything that reminds me even a little of Capcom's sadly abandoned Dino Crisis series, the trailer below doesn't inspire all that much confidence this one will pick up the mantle.

Remember the Electronic Wireless Show? Two of its hosts, Alice Bell and Nate Crowley, have started a new podcast "about video games (mostly)". It's called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
