        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto 6 is the most highly anticipated video game that's currently in development, and its eventual release is likely going to change the industry forever. With Rockstar currently aiming for a 2025 release, this gaming juggernaut is understandably intimidating many other companies.


Anonymous sources from competing video game publishers talked to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier and confirmed that these companies are waiting as long as possible to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch before they announce a specific release date for their own products. They're especially concerned because Rockstar still hasn't announced an official date for the game, and nobody is really sure if it's going to make its deadline or if the studio will delay it to 2026.

How to get Trial Coins in Path of Exile 2


The Trial of Sekhamas (Act 2) and the Trial of Chaos (Act 3) are both trials that require their own respective coin to enter. These coins are similar to the ones you used to go through each trial for the first time. The first one was given for free, but to enter either of these trials more, you will need to get your own. Fortunately and unfortunately, getting these coins is a very simple task, but they are quite rare.

It's that time of the year when in the middle of our personal GOTY list scrambles we sit back for a couple of hours to enjoy Geoff Keighley's annual round-up. For the last 10 years, though it's presented as a gong show and celebration, The Game Awards has essentially been a multiplatform conference, a platform for the big three, big third parties, and big indies to come together and get a trailer broadcast to the masses as holiday season approaches.
Say what you like, but you've got to give it to Keighley - it's a big production and pulling off a show of that scale is a hell of a job. Juggling all those names and trying to squeeze in enough variety to showcase the enormous breadth of the industry is no mean feat - and it's been a bumpy ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I received a penny for every time I did a post about a Doom or Doom 2 mod, I'd probably have enough to buy at least a loaf of bread. That may not sound impressive, but bread can be expensive these days, so that would easily equate to a couple hundred posts. It's still a fair amount for one person.


The point is that I've found another one. This one hits closer to home, as it pertains to a dystopian version of my home country, England. Also, the dystopian premise. That checks out as well. Over on ModDB, user chazlee is bringing us "Bolero," a dark take on ol' Blighty, with plenty of "urban dismay and raw insanity" to boot.


Image via chazlee/ModDB.


Taking on "Cannibals, Cultists, Nazi Bikers," and more in this Doom 2 mod, this is very much going for a leather-clad 1970s vibe, which is not quite my era, but I'm here for it all the same.


Dance, dance the Bolero


Sadly, "Bolero" is not yet out, with the download page simply having it down as TBD for its release date. For now, the images on ModDB will have to suffice, although it's hard to know what to expect from screenshots. But I do like the dark purple sky and biker gang vibe I get from what I assume is a title image.


Hopefully, it won't be too long until it's out. We all know the old Doom games inside and out by now, so it's always interesting to see the ways in which the fan base keeps tinkering with the original. It's no wonder we keep talking about the games. Or at least I do.


Add onto that all the bizarre ways Doom has been ported, which includes a version of it on Nintendo's Alarmo device and even placed within the cutesy world of Stardew Valley. Seriously, if I ever get sick of talking about the mods for these classic id Software games, know that I have been taken over by some sort of sentient amoeba*.


*"So what else is new!" Says the funniest person in the room.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 12 years of waiting, fans must have been quite delighted to see Path of Exile 2 finally drop on PC and console the other day. According to the game's Steam page, Grinding Gears' follow-up to its popular action RPG is going down a storm so far. In fact, it's hitting some pretty big numbers, according to recent data.


As always, we turn our attention to SteamDB – the third-party website that tracks all things related to Valve's gaming platform. Despite the fact that Path of Exile 2 has only been out a few days, it's already racked up 578,569 players on PC, with over 498,000 getting involved in the past 24 hours.




This is even more impressive when you realize the game's out in early access. Of course, it's been on more than a few people's radars, so it stands to reason that hype may be part of the reason we're seeing such impressive figures so soon after the early access launch. To say nothing of the number of console players who must have logged in.


The path continues


At the time of writing, Path of Exile 2 is at the number two spot on Steam's Top Sellers chart, though this is pretty typical for new releases. However, I'm pretty sure I saw it at number one yesterday, having temporarily knocked the Steam Deck from its pedestal. But it seems normal service has resumed.


Work is obviously still ongoing, and the developer recently said in a post on X that a hotfix is on the way. This small update will make it so "Raging Spirits can only summon 5 Raging Spirits per cast at all levels." The team also says it will be "making adjustments to other Trigger Meta-Gems," so keep an eye out for that.


Another post on X says Grinding Gears has been keeping an eye on feedback, and has been pleased with how the launch over the weekend went. Keep doing what you're doing, I guess, if you're currently playing and enjoying Path of Exile 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest power spikes you can have in Path of Exile 2 occurs when you properly equip your skills with potent Support Gems. At the start, you're limited to only two per skill, but it is possible to get more as you play through the game.


So here's how to get more Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2. 


How to earn Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2


Support Gems are special gems that can only be slotted into one of your equipped skills. They allow you to customize your skills, allowing for crazy and wacky setups that are actually quite potent when tested. You'll want to kit out your favorite skills that define your build, but access to only two slots makes that difficult. 


To get Support Gem Sockets, all you need to do is get lucky. Not kidding. A special currency called a Jeweler Orb can drop from any enemy you encounter. When used on a skill, it permanently unlocks an additional support socket for that skill only. You cannot undo this action, so think carefully before using one. Jeweler Orbs are not exactly common.


Depending on where you are in your socket progression, you will need to use either a Lesser Jeweler Orb or a Greater Jeweler Orb. Lesser orbs are for skills stuck at two slots, while Greaters are beyond that point. You'll start seeing Jeweler Orbs drop minimally starting in Act 3, and increasing in commonality as you progress (they are never 'common', however).

If you cast your mind back to earlier this year, you might recall that a man was arrested in Japan for selling modded data from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Well, it's clear that not everyone was paying attention to the repercussions, as last week, Japanese police announced that they had arrested a man on similar charges for meddling with Pokémon Sun (thanks, Automaton West).
In this instance, the culprit (a 32-year-old man from Saitama) was caught selling hacked save data from the Gen VII game for 5,200 yen (around £27 / $35) each, putting him in violation of Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act — which could earn him up to five years in prison or slapped with a fine of up to five million yen. Yikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set in a world where piracy is at an all-time high, it isn't surprising that One Piece has plenty of powerful warriors. While the addition of whacky Devil Fruit abilities makes the power struggle between the major factions far more intense, some characters rely on swordsmanship to dominate the high seas. This then raises the question of who the strongest swordsman in One Piece is.


Before jumping into the list, let's clear something up first. I only included characters who use swords as their primary weapons. Furthermore, their fighting style should be swordsmanship primarily. In that sense, Big Mom, while being one of the strongest characters who uses a sword, doesn't qualify for the list. For discussion's sake, the list will also include characters in their prime state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

All this stems from accessory manufacturer Satisfye and its new trailer for the upcoming Switch grip, the 'ZenGrip 2'. According to the company's website, the upcoming accessory is designed "for Next-Gen Console", so how else would you showcase it in a reveal trailer other than by sticking a definitely real 'Switch 2' in there?

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals has launched with a host of popular names from the superhero universe, but some of them are better than the rest.


In the first couple of days, it has become quite clear that a few characters are a notch above the rest. In their respective roles, they're the best options to consider. That said, the names present on the lower tiers also have their uses. In the right hands, they can be quite powerful.


Update Changelog


December 12, 2024: Jeff has been moved to S-tier. Wolverine has been dropped to B-tier. 


Marvel Rivals S-tier list


The S-tier characters are the top choices if you want to dominate the games. Their abilities make them quite overpowered compared to the other choices available in their respective roles.

Styling Challenges require you to have the right pieces to increase your score, Kindled Inspiration quests need specific items in your arsenal, and even main story progression sometimes relies on having a certain number of Outfit pieces available.

In 2024, the Switch's transfer speeds leave a lot to be desired, but that might be one of the wrinkles Nintendo is hoping to iron out with 'Switch 2', if the speculation surrounding a new job listing is to be believed (thanks, Gameranx).
Yep, the latest chatter from the 'Switch 2' rumour mill is all about microSD cards, specifically, Samsung's upcoming 'SD Express' cards, which the company revealed earlier this year. Samsung claims that these microSDs can reach transfer speeds of up to 800 MB/S — a noticeable bump on the current Switch's 60 MB/S on the branded SanDisk cards and 150 MB/S max on the SanDisk SDXC card — and it looks like Nintendo is hoping to support it in the future.

In any case, here’s how to use sprays in Marvel Rivals.


How to use sprays in Marvel Rivals


To use a spray in Marvel Rivals, you need to equip them on your character(s). So, to start, follow these steps:



In the main menu, head over to the Heroes tab.


Select the hero(es) that you plan on using. 


Head over to the Cosmetics tab.


In the sub-tab, go over to Sprays. 


Select the sprays you want to use, then press Equip.


A wheel should come up with four spray slots (this can go up to eight).

        <updated>2024-12-10T11:21:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you start getting into the more advanced movement strategies in Marvel Rivals, you’re going to want to turn options like Auto Swing off. This is something that will be useful for more competitive and higher-level play.


If you want to know how to disable this, here’s what you need to know. 


How to turn off Auto Swing in Marvel Rivals


To turn off Auto Swing in Marvel Rivals, you’ll have to head over to your settings. Follow these steps to get there:



Press the cogwheel at the top right of the main menu.


Alternatively, press the options/start button on console and hit Settings.


While in the Settings menu, head over to Controller / Keyboard section.


Find the Combat tab.


Select “All Heroes” in this tab and select Spider-Man.


Under the Hero section, he has an option called Automatic Swing.


Set this to off (X instead of a checkmark).



With that set, you should now be able to target your own grappling points when swinging around as Spider-Man. This will help you better flank enemy lines and not mess up when trying to traverse maps quickly.


Screenshot by Destructoid


What other characters have Auto Swing?


No other character has Auto Swing besides Venom, but there are advanced movement options similar to this so the game doesn’t automatically bind you to certain movements.


For example, Venom has a lot of movement options regarding running, crawling, and how wall climbing works. You can toggle if you want to hold the key to do these or not. You can also set whether you want him to move to the reticle rather than climbing straight upwards.


You’ll have to manually set this per character if they have different movement options like floating, slow-fall, or some kind of hold-toggle option. You’ll have to play around with this to get a feel of how each character works.


It’s recommended to go into the Practice Range first before committing to options like these because they’ll feel massively different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While exploring the later portions of Act 3 in Path of Exile 2, you may come across a peculiar set of mushrooms with no real defined purpose. These dubious shrooms take up a bunch of space in your inventory, so here's what you can do with them.


What are the mushrooms in Act 3 for in Path of Exile 2?


All throughout Path of Exile 2, picking up green-labeled items tended to yield amazing rewards if you could figure out what to do with them. Turns out, the mushrooms you pick up in Act Three are in a similar vein, only the rewards for these items are not exactly glamorous this time around.


As for what to do with them, if you didn't find them within the Apex of Filth, head to that location and kill enemies for them to eventually drop. Once you do have them, you're looking for a cauldron with a Cauldron Keeper standing behind it within the Apex of Filth. This zone is massive and is also quite dangerous, so it may take you an extensive amount of time to find the cauldron and the keeper. Due to maps in Path of Exile being randomized, I cannot give you the exact location. What I can say is that no matter which map variant you get, you'll find a flight of alter-like stairs just before reaching the Cauldron.

The mushrooms are reagents for the witch's concoction and can be placed within the witch's cauldron. Doing this will reward you with an Uncommon (Blue) Life Flask and a Mana Flask, both with completely variable stats. Whether or not they are good for you is up to you to decide based on your character build.


Additionally, the witch herself is a merchant who tends to sell gear that is beyond the standard you can find in town. I recommend visiting her on occasion for some potential high-quality gear.

Currently, there are seven islands in GO FISHING, and each one has two rare fish. Just like all fish in the game, rare ones have their own chance of being caught. You may get extremely lucky and capture one during your first reel, or you may end up fishing for hours. Unfortunately, that's just how the game works.


You'll need the best rod, the right skills, maybe some bait, and lots of patience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Citadelle des Morts location in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 has plenty of easter eggs that are hidden from plain view, and one of them involves a secret Maya cutscene.


Maya has already played an important role in Zombies lore, and she has a noticeable presence in the two older regions - Terminus Island and Liberty Falls. The secret cutscene that's found in Citadelle des Morts can be unlocked pretty easily once you know where to look. This cutscene also helps to expand on the lore of Maya and her relationship with her brother from what happened on Terminus.


Black Ops 6 Citadelle des Morts secret Maya cutscene explained


There are certain requirements that have to be taken care of if you want to unlock the cutscene. You'll have to equip Maya from the loadout screen if you want to access the cutscene. Next, start a new match from Zombies and make sure to equip the Citadelle des Morts map. You can play with a squad, but playing solo will let you focus more on the task at hand. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The exact location you have to find is inside the castle. Head to the F0 coordinates, where you'll find the Vulture Aid machine. This spot is found on the eastern side of the map. Near the machine, you'll find a table with a radio sitting on top of it.


If you reach the spot too early, I likely won't work, and you'll have to wait till the radio is active. Once it's active, interact with it, and the nearby door (right beside it) will stay unlocked. Go inside it to access a secret region.


First, you'll encounter a few vermin in this location, so go ahead and eliminate them. Next, you'll come across a mini-boss, whom you'll need to defeat as well. This mini-boss will drop a key - pick it up, and take the path that leads straight ahead. This will activate the special cutscene involving Maya in Black Ops 6. It's a really cool easter egg, even if you don't get any in-game advantages out of it.

Ahead of the grand opening of Super Nintendo World: Donkey Kong Country this week, some of the original Donkey Kong Country development team spoke to VGC about the IP being adapted to an entire theme park.
During the same chat, artist Steve Mayles - who helped co-found Playtonic Games (Yooka-Laylee) and create the Kong family, admitted he would "very much" like to work on another DKC game. It's now been "30 years" since he worked on the original entry. He also mentioned how happy he was to see the characters he created being "given such love after all this time".

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Palworld developer Pocketpair in September of this year.
In a notable development, Pocketpair has now released an update for Palworld which changes the Pokémon-like throwing mechanic in the game. As detailed in the latest v0.3.11 patch notes, "player-owned Pals" are now always summoned "near the player". In other words, you can no longer summon Pals with Pal Spheres in certain spots on the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its debut all the way back in Season 7, the Cold Swap has grown to be an absolute fan favorite among the massive array of pickaxes in Fortnite, the latter given its unique aesthetic and charm. 


But true to that, it's no surprise that a question continues to arise among the community. After all, when will the Cold Snap return? Here's when will the Cold Snap return to the Fortnite shop, as well as how much the item will most likely cost. 


When is Cold Snap returning to Fortnite?


Unfortunately for all who, like me, missed the chance to add the pickaxe to their collection when it was last featured in the game's shop, there's currently no way to know when the Cold Snap will be returning to Fortnite. On that note, and given both the item's first release date and how well it fits the Holiday theme, I would not be surprised if the pickaxe were to make a return to the shop during the days surrounding this year's Christmas.


For those curious, the pickaxe's last appearance in the store dates back to June 28, 2024, when it was featured as part of the Clix's Locker bundle.


How Much Does the Cold Snap Cost?


According to the Fortnite.GG database, the Cold Snap has been featured in the game's shop a total of 63 times since its release on December 28, 2018, In all times, the pickaxe could be purchased either alone for 800 V-bucks or as part of bundles ranging from 2.300 to 2.500 V-Bucks. 


Now that you know when we can expect the Cold Snap pickaxe to return in Fortnite, don't forget to also check out How to find Godzilla. If you are like me and cannot wait for the mode's debut, I also recommend checking out All available jobs in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC players on Marvel Rivals may experience getting stuck at 99 percent loaded when playing most of their matches in the game. It’s a nasty bug that will most likely force you to miss a match and receive penalties.


In any case, here is a solution to this problem right now in the game. 


How to fix loading stuck at 99 in Marvel Rivals


There are a few fixes that may work for you if you’re experiencing the 99 percent loaded screen in Marvel Rivals. Note that the experience has worked for some, but not all.


Make sure your specs meet the minimum requirements or higher


While this is something you should ensure before even installing the game, head over to the game’s steam page to see the system requirements. The following is the minimum you’d need to run the game, although it’s recommend…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Night City isn't done with you yet. Developer CD Projekt Red is showcasing a surprise update for Cyberpunk 2077 in a new stream on December 10. Update 2.2 includes bug fixes and "new features" to the game. No, it's not a PlayStation 5 Pro patch. Stop asking.


Word on what the surprise Update 2.2 will bring to Cyberpunk 2077 soon will be a mystery until its contents are revealed. CD Projekt Red announced via X that it's lifting the veil on the patch tomorrow, December 10, at 5 p.m. CET during a live stream on Twitch and YouTube. 


"Join us for a new episode of #REDstreams, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2," the company wrote on X. "See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel."




Cyberpunk 2077 surprise update brings new things, but not that


The news of another patch wasn't expected, especially since it hasn't even been a week since the last one. Update 2.1 arrived for players on December 4 with additional fixes, features, and vehicle options. Perhaps something needed more work and got delayed for a few days. Who can say? 





We don't know what's inside Update 2.2 for Cyberpunk 2077, but we know what it will not bring. The company has no plans to ship a PS5 Pro patch for the game. CD Projekt announced the news in November, but that didn't stop folks on X from asking about it. Several times. The game also won't get a New Game Plus mode, as doing so would "break the way the game is constructed," according to its lead quest designer. 


All we know is that it'll bring more "cool" features and break all of your mods. But according to the team on X, "It will be worth it."

Former Ubisoft designer and creator of Rayman and Beyond Good & Evil Michel Ancel has lifted the lid on part of Beyond Good & Evil 2's troubled development.
In an interview with French outlet Superpouvoir (via VGC), the ex-Ubisoft employee, who left in 2020 to work at a wildlife sanctuary, Ancel said "Passion is a fabulous energy, but it can also lead to clashes between enthusiasts. On Beyond Good & Evil 2, for example, there were too many problems between managers."

I’m not sure Jake Clover's Cape Hideous is about anything. I’m not even sure it’s about something. It could be! Maybe I’m just too daft to see it. However, from what I can tell, it’s just one really strange slice of life told with an extremely ugly but captivating art style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're someone who loves to play LEGO Fortnite, there might be a couple of amazing skins that you can unlock in the near future for absolutely free of cost.


Epic giving away free skins isn't uncommon, and that's done periodically across all available game modes. The recent rumors are from reliable leaker ShiinaBR, who has shared information about the two upcoming freebies. Incidentally, the skins will be exclusive to the LEGO Fortnite mode, and one of them so far has been a shop item. If the rumors are to be believed, players will be able to unlock Mr. Dappermint and Chord Kahele for free.


How to unlock Chord Kahele in LEGO Fortnite




To unlock this specific outfit, you'll need to earn XP on the mobile version of the game. Hence, you'll need to download the Android client and then use the same account. After that, you'll have to gain a certain amount of XP (the exact amount remains unknown) by playing the game on your mobile device. Do note that you can't complete this objective by playing on your consoles, and that's how you can unlock the Chord Kahele skin.


How to unlock Mr. Dappermint In LEGO Fortnite


Unlocking this skin will be much easier, but you'll have to create a LEGO account (or login to your existing account). Once done, make sure to link it with your Epic account (the same one you use to play Fortnite). After you have completed the step, Mr. Dappermint will be added to your account.


Incidentally, the skin has been present in the item shop, so I am not sure what step Epic will take if you have purchased it previously. As of writing, the release date for the two skins remains unknown. Additionally, you'll be able to find the unlock condition for any free skin that gets announced in the near future.

We'll admit, the 2000 PlayStation title Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles wasn't the first "classic" to spring to mind when we wondered what Aspyr would be remastering next. But hey, it's coming to Switch next year, and eShop pre-orders are now open.
In a new pre-order trailer (above), we get another look at the Star Wars arcade brawler, complete with its new features. This includes all unlockables available from the jump, 13 fresh playable characters (shoutout to the Weequay fans) and some of the classic cheat codes from later releases of the game — Qui-Gon's head has never looked so bulbous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

It's almost time to give 2024 the finger, swallow a flagon of mince pie formula and tapdance backwards into the holiday, but the Maw still needs a little feeding and it has no appetite for mince pies. Nor will it eat tinsel, candy canes, mistletoe, snowmen or reindeer, though goodness knows we've tried. So much screaming. No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae…

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

Say "hello" and probably also "AIEEEEBLubLBBLBLBL" to Darkwater, a new co-op horror extraction game in which you brave the frigid oceans of an alien moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit.

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is Dragon Age going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual "reinvention".

It's got Subnautica's premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry. It's got Subnautica's core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.

"RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X.

"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
