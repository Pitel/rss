        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to the rank of underworld's chief rock-pusher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Path events in Disney Dreamlight Valley are a great way to get dozens of motifs, furniture items, and cosmetics for your villagers. However, you'll have to finish challenging event duties filled with riddles to complete one of these events. One such riddle is spending time with a fella whose initials are M.M., which, fortunately, is easy once you learn who this character is.


How to spend time with a fella whose initials are M.M.


The Disney Dreamlight Valley villager whose initials are M.M. is none other than Mickey Mouse himself. If you want to spend time with someone with these initials for an ongoing Star Path event, you'll have to find Mickey and hang out with him until you complete the duty.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The best way to complete this duty is to approach Mickey Mouse, ask him to hang out with you and do daily activities or quests. You can also do whichever activity you assigned to Mickey at friendship level two to take advantage of hangout bonuses, but you're not required to do this for this duty. As long as you spend time with him, you'll finish it in no time.


You'll usually find Mickey Mouse roaming around the village, hanging out in his house, or eating at Chez Remy. He sleeps for a few hours, from around 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., but he's easy to find outside of this. If you have the Rift in Time expansion, check if he's in Eternity Isle if you struggle to spot him.


Depending on the Star Path, the requirements and rewards for the duty will differ slightly. During events like Majesty and Magnolias, you'll spend 15 minutes hanging out with Mickey Mouse and receive ten tokens that you can spend on rewards.

Reloaded patches are typically the last major patch before the next seasonal update, which for MW3 will be Season 5. That doesn't mean that they are small tweaks saving the big changes for the seasonal update, as Sledgehammer has added a new multiplayer map and weapon to keep things fresh. 


Reclaimer 18 shotgun


If you fancy getting up-close and personal with your enemies, then you should try out the new Reclaimer 18 shotgun, which is modeled after the classic Spas-12 we've seen in previous CoD games. 


There's also the Sledgehammer melee weapon, which can be unlocked by completing Weekly Challenges.

While Capcom has already unveiled who else will be joining the roster for the game's second year, including two SNK guest characters, today's update may have already teased a pair of potential fighters for the next batch of DLC: Vega and Balrog.


For context, Bison's inclusion also means there are new missions in Street Fighter 6's World Tour mode. One such mission tasks you with tracking down Vega and Balrog, who were among the highest ranking members of the criminal organization Shadaloo and worked directly under Bison. While the two don't appear in person, progressing the mission sees you receive text messages from both of them (as highlighted by the Fighting Game Annivers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's dig in.
Shovel Knight is the very definition of an indie darling. Bursting onto the scene in 2014, Yacht Club Games’ slick, throwback platformer caught the imagination of gamers both old and new. Its stunning aesthetic, tight controls, and humorous writing made it a must-play, while its ample secrets, tough but never punishing difficulty, and cheat codes added that crucial replayability factor. The game seemed to hit all the right notes. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. A treasure trove followed – and what a haul it was.
Three campaigns starring three distinct and equally charming characters from the core cast, as well as a wonderful and woefully overlooked platform fighter. And that’s not even mentioning the amiibo line! If you don’t include Smash Bros. Ultimate fighters, only a handful of other companies' characters have been granted the honour of amiibo representation (Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, and Diablo, if you're wondering), and none that carry the prestige of a gold version. Each character is a thing of beauty in miniature, plastic form. We would’ve bought the whole Order of No Quarter if we could.

If you liked Townscaper for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of Tiny Glade's homely castle creation, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. Dystopika is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold, the developer behind El Paso, Elsewhere and Life Eater, has announced their next game, Clickolding, which I don’t want to write out in its stylized, all-caps format around my mother. Although, I don’t think she’d get the reference.


Clickolding bills itself as an “incremental narrative” game. You play as someone holding a tally counter. A strange person wants to see you click it. Yeah, click it. Click it harder. Just like that. I’m guessing that as you click, the story advances. Judging by the trailer, the person pulls out a pistol coercively, but some of the screenshots also suggest a cash reward if you’re able to reset the counter.




Beyond simply clicking, the press release promises that there will be “environmental puzzles and managing a tenuous and uncertain relationship with an uncanny host.”


I’m not really certain how in-depth I should go in explaining the subject matter. It’s hard to be certain how facetious Clickolding is, though it seems clear that it’s trying to plunge into the darker side of the subject matter. It will supposedly feature an “uncomfortable and shifting atmosphere.”


Approaching what could potentially be a sensitive and disturbing topic reminds me of Strange Scaffold’s Life Eater. With that game, I felt that its handling of the subject wound up blunting the message. However, in that case, it was mostly that the gameplay did not support the narrative, whereas here, the actual game part of the game is so simple that it doesn’t seem like it could even bend that way.


We won’t have to wait long to find out. Clickolding is set to release on July 16, 2024 on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t dislike The First Descendant. It has a good grasp of the numbers-go-up-yay appeal behind looter shooters. Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having come out in 2007, the original BioShock is now pretty old, but that doesn't stop it from having quite the legacy. With its twisted meta-narrative, it was more than just a basic FPS, proving that there are still interesting ways of telling stories in video games.


But what if it was remade in say, oh I don't know, Unreal Engine 5? Well, that's what one person wondered. As spotted by DSO Gaming, environmental artist Kaleb Nekumanesh (who worked as a designer on Halo Infinite) has rendered some screenshots and videos from BioShock, reimagined in UE5.




Now, the original game was already pretty gloomy, but these renderings really make the environments pop with a much prettier version of said gloom. We see hints of a Big Daddy in one of them, with each image showing recognizable parts of Rapture with more modern visual acuity. It should be made clear that these images and clips don't represent an actual remake, as far as I can tell. They're just a concept.


Would you kindly... make a fourth game?


It's been 17 years since the first game of the series came out, and 11 years since the last installment. As lauded as 2K's BioShock is, it remains to be seen what's happening regarding anything new on the horizon. It's been said that a BioShock 4 has been in development for years, but we haven't really had any updates for quite some time.


We know very little about what the fourth game's story will be about, where it'll be set, what platforms it'll be available on, and even less on a potential release date. We do know that a BioShock movie adaptation is in development at Netflix, so we'll probably be seeing that before a new game.


In the meantime, feel free to check out the rest of Kaleb's renderings on their ArtStation page, as well as the rest of their work.

As always, the Reloaded update is an enhancement to the current season, introducing some new tweaks and additional content. While they generally don't make sweeping changes to the game, these patch notes are big, but I'll break down the headlines for you before revealing the full patch notes. 


Kar98k nerfed


For many, the news that the Kar98k has been nerfed will be the headline, as the sniper rifle has been divisive throughout the community since its launch. Some have praised it for making sniping fun again, while others have been convinced that it's too powerful and was ru…]]></summary>

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

Remember when you first caught a glimpse of Super Mario 64 running on the Nintendo DS and how utterly mindblowing it was at the time? It's easy to forget just how far handheld gaming has come in the years since, but seeing one of the greatest platformers of all time come to life on such a humble piece of hardware was truly something else.
Fast-forward to the present day, and one coder by the name of Joshua Barretto is going another step further with a custom rewrite of Super Mario 64 running on the Game Boy Advance. At the time of writing, the project is still ongoing, so there's no doubt much improvement still to be made, but Barretto has managed to implement iconic levels from the game along with traversal moves like the long jump and backflip.

        <updated>2024-06-26T14:53:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that they’ve acquired the Surgeon Simulator franchise under its Infogrames label. The press release suggests that this was done through an agreement with publisher TinyBuild rather than the original developer, Bossa Studios. TinyBuild purchased the IP in 2022.


The original Surgeon Simulator made a sizeable splash when it was released in 2013. Similar to Octodad or QWOP, it focuses on the humorous mishaps that happen when an over-detailed and inaccurate physics simulation is applied to a concept that requires fine motor skills. It wound up inspiring a wave of similar “simulator” concepts in the indie sphere.


This was followed in 2020 by Surgeon Simulator 2, which doesn’t seem to have been as popular with players. It focuses on multiplayer and has a campaign… I didn’t play it, if it’s not obvious. Having a multiplayer focus is a quick way to get me to skip over a game.


I did, however, play the original back when it was still called Surgeon Simulator 2013. It’s not really surprising to me that a sequel wasn’t as well received. The central concept is a lot of fun, and it’s still for a while, but it’s very one-dimensional. The joke is only funny for so long. I tried replaying it later and found that I was too adept at it for it to actually be entertaining anymore.


On that note, I’m not sure what Atari/Infogrames plans to do with it. It’s rather similar to their purchase of Totally Reliable Delivery Service, which had also been published by TinyBuild. The press release says, “Infogrames will seek to expand distribution, potentially develop new titles or content, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations as part of a long-term plan to preserve and expand the franchise.”


Okay. I guess we’ll potentially see more titles or t-shirts.

Mulan's maze during the Orienteering quest features eight pebbles you have to find. Although some are out in the open, most are hiding behind trash piles for you to destroy before picking them up. You can also find a bonus item that you'll need for later quests.


The first maze pebble is the easiest to miss, as it hides behind the gate you first enter. Upon walking through the maze, turn around and look behind this gate to spot your first pebble.

Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While on The Dragon Army quest, Mushu will task you to find various resources around the Mulan realm. While some can be easily obtainable, a few can be tricky to locate. We're here to help guide you on where to find all of Mushu's Dragon Statue materials in Disney Dreamlight Valley.


Where to find all Mushu's Dragon Statue materials in DDV


The Dragon Army mission in Disney Dreamlight Valley requires you to find the following materials:



50 Camp Mud


3 Buckets of Water


10 Firewood


10 Red Spider Lilies


5 Chrysanthemums


10 Dream Shards



Most resources can be randomly found throughout Mulan's realm. This includes the Red Spider Lilies, Chrysanthemums, and Firewood. Just look around for flowers and wood and pick them up as much as possible. As for Camp Mud, players must dig up large muddy spots with their shovels:

Dream Shards require you to return to Dreamlight Valley. You can earn these by digging up spots (sparkling if possible), clearing out Night Thorns, or feeding a critter their favorite food. Players can also take a picture with Mushu to satisfy another requirement. 


Buckets of Water locations


The Buckets of Water are the most challenging to obtain, so we'll break down each location. One is just before the main entrance, next to some bamboo.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Looking over to the left, you may see another Bucket of Water out in the distance. Head toward the left side before the main entrance, following the river to get it.

The last Buckets of Water will be on the left side, toward the back of the camp, near the river.

Now it's time to craft the Unified Dragon Statue using the nearby crafting table in Mulan's realm. Ensure that you interact with the kiln shortly after, next to Mushu, to progress further in the DDV  The Dragon Army quest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're going to be a top-notch bounty hunter in GTA Online's new Bottom Dollar Bounties update, you'll need a weapon that can incapacitate rather than eliminate. That's where the Stun Gun comes in, and we can help you get your hands on it. 


If you've started your bounty hunter business already, and want to start bringing in crooks for cash, you'll need to be able to take down enemies without killing them. The Stun Gun is the easiest way to do this, shooting an electric current through the body and knocking them to the floor. 


So, if you want to add one to your inventory, here's how to do it. 


How to get the Stun Gun in GTA Online


There are three ways to get the Stun Gun in GTA Online, one of which is free, while the other will cost you some cash. 



You can get the Stun Gun for free during the Silent & Sneaky approach when completing The Diamond Casino Heist. 


You can purchase the Stun Gun from the Agency Armory for $375,000. ($326,250 for Agency owners.)


You can purchase the Stun Gun from the Gun Van when it rotates into the stock for $262,500. 



There's three ways to get one. Image via Rockstar


How to get the Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement Stun Gun skin in GTA Online


If you fancy getting a special edition skin to show off your new job as a bounty hunter, Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement has created a special red and blue-themed weapon skin for your Stun Gun. 


To unlock it, you'll need to complete the second tier of the Bottom Dollar Bounties career progress. The weapon is labeled as "Stun Gun Finish," and will be unlocked as soon as you complete the second stage. 


At the moment, it seems like the Bottom Dollar Bail Enforcement skin is only available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and PC players have not been able to unlock it yet. It's possible that it will be unlocked in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

Well, your oddly specific desire will be met with the newest life-sim on the block, Cattle Country, which is bound to grab peoples' attention for featuring the voice of Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan in its reveal trailer.


Yes, that is indeed Roger Clark doing the narration, lending a suitably classic cowboy voice though it's somewhat softer than his performance as Arthur Morgan, which is fitting for a game that's obviously going for a cozier vibe than Red Dead Redemption 2's gritty melodrama. Clark being picked to narrate must've been a deliberate choice since, according to IGN, Cattle Country developer Castle Pixel and publisher Playtonic Friends are calling the game "Red Dead Redemption meets Starde…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley's Mulan Realm is the ninth realm added to the game and features two characters: Mulan and Mushu. Before you can find and befriend these two, you'll have to unlock their realm, explore the region, and complete their friendship questlines.


Where to find the Mulan Realm in Disney Dreamlight Valley


You'll find the Mulan Realm on the third floor of Dreamlight Castle, right next to the Beauty and the Beast door. It costs 15,000 Dreamlight to unlock, making it as costly as the Monster's Inc. Realm.

After entering the castle and ascending the stairs, look for a door with a dragon symbol covered by night thorns. Interacting with the door initiates a conversation with Merlin, prompting you to pay the Dreamlight price. Once you pay the cost, you can enter the realm, begin the New Recruit quest, and meet both Mushu and Mulan, with the area now accessible forever if you ever wish to return later.


How to get more Dreamlight in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Dreamlight is a currency you use to unlock biomes and realms. You can obtain more by completing your Dreamlight Duties, which you can find through the Dreamlight tab in the main menu. These duties grant you around 100-250 Dreamlight per task, giving you a quick way to farm this resource.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Most Dreamlight Duties are fairly simple, with objectives such as removing night thorns, mining minerals, and selling produce. You can also find some in other categories that give you more Dreamlight as you reach milestones, but your best bet is to focus on the main duty list if you want to get this currency quickly.

Traditionally, Destiny 2 players only get one chance to watch a cutscene before they're gone forever. Over the years, we've been trained to always be prepared for an important moment in the story just in case we have the only chance to see it. There's nothing more devastating than missing a moment every other player has seen, such as the ending cutscene in The Final Shape. However, there's a way to catch it if you didn't see it due to a bug or time constraints.

Therese are literal perfume bottles that have been turned into weapons by the dreaded Perfumers in the Lands Between, so it's definitely a pretty unique weapon for an RPG like this.


Lightning Perfume Bottle Location





The Lightning Perfume Bottle can be found on a corpse in a shallow pond in the Cerulean Coast area just after you enter the area from Charo's Hidden Grave. It is a little awkward to get due to the presence of a Furnace Golem and a patrolling ram that causes lightning strikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

MW3's Season 4 Reloaded includes new map Incline, the Reclaimer 18 shotgun, and of course, the new Bit Party playlist that gives Modern Warfare an incredible retro look. 


If that sounds like your cup of tea, then here's everything you need to know about the event, including its start date and how you can unlock those free rewards. 


It's hip to be square. Image via Activision


MW3 Retro Warfare start date


MW3's Retro Warfare event starts on June 26, 2024, as part of the Season 4 Reloaded patch. The event will run for one week, coming to an end on July 3, 2024. 


How to unlock Retro Warfare rewards


If you want to unlock the free rewards that come with the Retro Warfare event, you'll need to earn XP by playing matches and completing challenges. 


As always, there will be ten rewards in total, with the XP requirement increasing with each one. Should you make it all the way to the end, you will unlock a special skin themed after the event, as has become customary with MW3's in-game events. 


Have we seen the Retro Warfare rewards yet?


No, we haven't seen the Retro Warfare rewards just yet, and won't until the event goes live with Season 4 Reloaded on June 26. 


Based on previous events, however, we expect to see calling cards, emblems, and weapon charms, along with a number of Double XP tokens to help you maximize your performance. 


We'll update this piece once we've seen the rewards.

You can start Mesmerize from the Director in Destiny 2 by opening the Nessus map. I went into this mission just over the recommended power level of 1945, but it was still incredibly difficult. The Vex throw everything they have and the kitchen sink at you, so be prepared for a big old fight with multiple stages to battle through.

Once again, the world is on the cusp of being taken over by the evil General Donald Morden and his Rebel Army. Only the Peregrine Falcon Squad, led by the heroic Marco Rossi, stand in the way of the Rebels establishing their New World Order. This could be the plot of just about any entry in the Metal Slug series, which is at its best when you don’t take it too seriously. Metal Slug Attack Reloaded, a remake of a microtransaction-laden gacha tower-defence mobile game, does its best to uphold the goofy tone of the series while stripping out the worst bits of the 2016 version.
At least, it does its best to take the frustrating bits out. The Switch version doesn’t have any microtransactions, thankfully – but it does still very much feel like a gacha game that expects you to log in every day and grind your way to victory. The result is an uneven but still enjoyable game that is constrained by its origins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The meta in Elden Ring is ever changing as players find new things to crush their enemies with. Right now, Ash of War: Rolling Sparks is definitely a highly sought-after item because of how it interacts with some weapons and its build potential. If you are wondering where to go to get this particular skill, then I have you covered.


Ash of War: Rolling Sparks Location





To get the Ash of War: Rolling Sparks, you will need to go to the eastern side of the camp at the south of Shadow Keep. You can get there easily by following the road north from the Highroad Cross Site of Grace at the back of Castle Ensis; just make sure to avoid the attention of the massive Furance Golem if it is still alive.

Sod's Law struck that day… and it's returned with a smirk. Shadow Of The Erdtree has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.

Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

While this hardly means FromSoftware's going to introduce an easy mode any time soon, it has put out a calibration update to try and make things more balanced.


This update, as detailed on Bandai Namco's website, primarily revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings, which is Shadow of the Erdtree's unique leveling system for boosting the attack and defence of your character and spirit summons. This is done by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes.

This ghost-like character has been living up to his name, moving around the island seemingly oblivious to the carnage that's going on around them. Get too close, and sometimes they just disappear, leaving you bewildered and wondering if you actually saw them at all. 


Who is The Wanderer?


Truthfully, we don't know yet. Interestingly, however, The Wanderer has been teased throughout Season 3 if you know where to look for the clues.

We have some wildly vivid memories of playing a demo for the original Little Big Adventure included with a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK before getting our hands on the full game. It was such a uniquely weird title. You could switch your stances depending on the situation; so if you want to whallop a guard, you'd toggle the 'aggressive' stance and throw a few punches before hightailing it with the 'athletic' stance. So good.
Now, in Fall 2024, a full remake titled Little Big Adventure - Twinsen's Quest will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch from Microids and studio , boasting completely revamped visuals, a modernised control system, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

Following a datamine last September, there's been another update about a new batch of DLC characters supposedly on the way to Mortal Kombat 1.
Although there's been no official announcement about a second Kombat Pack just yet, according to a dataminer known as 'interloko' on social media - six more characters, two new arenas, and five new announcers are apparently getting ready to join the fight.

Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is now available on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch and if you're interested to know if this remaster is worth your while, you might want to read on...
We've gathered some of the reviews already doing the rounds online (and to let you know, we’re working on our own at the time of writing, so watch this space). While not every single one is focused on the Switch release, they still offer an idea of what you can expect if you are a returning to this title, which originally made its debut on the GameCube and other platforms in 2003.

By now, you might have seen some stories about the team behind Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. While the original 3DS release in 2013 was made by the talented Canadian-based studio Next Level Games, for the game's high-definition Switch version, it seems Nintendo has once again called on the services of the Australian developer Tantalus Media.
The Aussie Nintendo fansite Vooks.net highlighted this in its review of the game, with multiple outlets like IGN and VGC also confirming this studio's major involvement in the project just a day out from the game's official launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go on, tell us.
Luigi makes a very spooky return this week in Luigi's Mansion 2 HD for the Nintendo Switch. Of course, as you likely already know, this new release is a high-definition port of the original 2013 3DS release. The reviews for the title are already rolling in and so far they've been quite positive.
In our review here on Nintendo Life, we gave the game a "great" score of 8 out of 10, calling it the best way to play Luigi's Mansion 2 as of 2024, but also felt it could have maybe included some extra content to make it a little more appealing for returning players.

To kick off A Rising Chorus: Act I Week 3, you need to head to the H.E.L.M. and speak with Failsafe. When I did this, the AI repeated what it had ended Week 2 with, so don't be alarmed if you also hear the same thing. You're not going mad; Bungie likely just wanted to remind us of where we left off.

Best Sigewinne healer support build


As a pure healer support, Sigewinne only cares about her HP stat. She doesn’t need Energy Recharge except to trigger the 4pc Noblesse Oblige artifact set. She doesn’t need CRIT or ATK, since she’s not doing damage. Just build as much HP as possible.


Equip any weapon that has an HP secondary stat. Sigewinne’s best weapon is her 5-star signature, Silvershower Heartstrings. However, you can just as easily equip the 3-star Recurve Bow and still have plenty of healing. Recurve Bows can be found in chests in Mondstadt or from certain NPCs. Recurve Bow doesn’t…]]></summary>

Sigewinne offsets Furina’s HP drain and enables more Fanfare stacks, boosting your whole team’s damage while keeping them alive. As Hydro characters, the two can also provide Energy for one another, reducing the need to build Energy Recharge. Sigewinne will also provide a small buff to her teammates’ Skill damage.

The final battle in Elden Ring is against the Promised Consort Radahn. That's right! You thought you had seen the last of this murderous maniac in the main game, but the boy is back. He is just as brutal to deal with as he was in the base game but for different reasons this time.

The malware was intended to interfere with BitTorrent traffic, presumably as a network management solution. A police investigation suggests that cost savings likely played a role too, which is not surprising given local file-sharing habits.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

We were tapping our foot the whole way through the trailer for the Brisbane-based studio's third title, Tempopo. Combining music with the outside world, the game sees Hana — a young magical girl living in the clouds — restoring her musical garden of flowers. All of her Tempopo creatures have magical abilities and are bursting with personality, but only Hana can tell them where to go and guide them along the right path.

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

All told, it seems as though this one is exactly what you'd expect it to be: an HD upgrade of a 3DS game on Switch. As such, many fans have understandably questioned the game's price tag when compared to something like Metroid Prime Remastered. Still, it seems like it might still be worth checking out if you're after more Luigi's Mansion.

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

Do you feel that chill? It's probably the haunting presence of Luigi's Mansion 2 HD which will be bringing the spooks to Switch this Thursday (27th June). We have already shared our thoughts on Nintendo's latest remaster, calling it "the exact same game that many of you will have no doubt played 11 years ago - it just looks much nicer" in our review and now Digital Foundry has stepped in to provide a full technical analysis on the release.
All in all, things look rather swell. Naturally, the majority of the Digital Foundry analysis is dedicated to the visual upgrade, calling it a "smart, clean enhancement" and noting the massive boost in polygon count. According to the outlet, the remaster targets native 1080p in docked mode and 720p in handheld, with anti-aliasing on both offering some of the console's "best image quality".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's-a-the-other-guy.
Looking back over our 2013 review of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon on the 3DS has been a timely reminder of why we love this game so very much, yet have failed to return to it beyond our original playthrough back in the day - an oddity, given that we're quite partial to hoovering up every last secret there is to find in most games we enjoy.
It was the controls, you see. They were fiddly in the first Luigi's Mansion, and in the second game the lack of an extra thumbstick on the 3DS made for an experience that felt marred slightly by the shortcomings of the system on which it was delivered. It wasn't a huge deal — this writer is still very much in agreement with the 9/10 score dished out by this site at the time — it was always just one of those things with this series. A great idea, smart games, excellent puzzles and tons of atmosphere, all held back a little bit. A franchise that felt like it needed unleashing onto a new platform.

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It's like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can't work together to escape the inferno. Right?

Developer Game Freak has been known to dabble in projects outside of the Pokémon franchise, producing the likes of the excellent Pocket Card Jockey and Little Town Hero, and now it's just launched a new mobile game called Pand Land (thanks, Siliconera). If you remember, the company filed trademarks for the title at the start of the year, but we weren't too sure what it was all about at the time.
Although there's no word on a worldside release at the time of writing, Pand Land is available via Android and iOS in Japan. Described as a casual marine adventure RPG, you travel the lands with your crew to collect various bits of treasure. Boasting some rather charming voxel-based visuals, you'll also explore dangerous dungeons and can tackle the game either on your own or with friends.

If you're a staunch fan of the 3DS, then chances are you've dabbled in the Streetpass and Spotpass features over the years. The latter, of course, is no longer available since Nintendo shut down the online servers, but if you're out and about with your 3DS, then you can still benefit from the StreetPass function (that is, if you find anyone else with their own console).
One of the games that made use of the StreetPass function was Puzzle Swap, which allowed you to slowly reveal images via new tiles. Some of these were exclusive images offered via the Spotpass feature, and a group of fans is currently on the hunt for one last image.

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window. This will be an evolving list t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you're intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what's coming.

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an "Innapropriate activity detected" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by "Project Phoenix", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a "visual prototype" for a brand new Red Faction game.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the 'default' option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn't treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won't guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They're more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat's hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it's a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you'll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.

That Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer.

The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.

Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree has finally been released on PC, adding a fat, rancid helping of open world role-playing to an open world RPG of already trouser-wetting, skirt-soiling scale and hazard. You can find this "first and last" Elden Ring DLC expansion on Steam, the Xbox Store and in the suppurating depths of your very worst nightmares. Am I overdoing it yet? No matter. Let's press on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic's abilities, but we've seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…]]></summary>

Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in multiple seasons of a television show, in Fortnite, and now in Call of Duty.

The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. "Gobshite" became "bastard". The "polis" were localised as the "police". And every "yersel" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became "yourself". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to "International English" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There's another option, says one of the game's developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revealed at yesterday's Nintendo Direct stream - but absolutely coming to PC because there's a Steam page for it - The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy seems like a mash-up of visual novel and Fire Emblem-y RPG battles on grids. And it's by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there's one thing that really gets me going, it's a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is very little in this world that would get between me and playing an RPG made by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, double for one with a soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form. Have a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993's Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It's a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.

No, you numpty, you nyaff, you roaster; within the internal chronology of Dragon Quest, 3 comes first.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. "Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too," notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. "So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.]]></summary>

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.
The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the "themes or core elements" of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a "short-term way", by the experience of having a daughter.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.]]></summary>

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.]]></summary>

With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the "same" money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.]]></summary>

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don't care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom's big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…]]></summary>

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.]]></summary>

From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, shovel me timbers! Shovel Knight, the retro platformer that started it all (it all being everything from a roguelike spin-off to a Dead Cells cameo) turns 10 this month, and Yacht Club Games are releasing a ultimate edition to celebrate. Entitled the ‘Shovel Of Hope DX’, this definitive-me-doo bundles in the original game with old and new features like saving and rewinding, over 20 playable characters, local and online co-op, and new modes. Grab your shovel and prepare to dig for the trailer, then look foolish as you realise it’s directly below this paragraph.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Two's company, three's a crowd," the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely "three's a moderately balanced squad, two's a massive liability"? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which "only" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more "intimate", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

Due to a shortage of hands at the pump and persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster. Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself. Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.

Books obviously come in many different sizes, but did you know that there’s an obscure law that dictates the legal limit for how long a novel can be? It’s measured in ‘George Martins’. If your story is more than three ‘Georges’ wide, you’re swiftly escorted to a cell and made to eat any bits of book that reference more than three characters in a scene with the same surname.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
