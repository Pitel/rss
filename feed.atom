Square Enix has dropped a surprise demo for Star Ocean The Second Story R on Switch, and other consoles, today.
No, you didn't miss a Nintendo Direct announcement — the publisher shared the news on social media shortly after the showcase instead of during. You know, where the PS1 remake was announced back in June 2023? Oh well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 update is approaching to clean up the mess wrought by the
launch release. This release is separate from the Phantom Liberty expansion that launches
soon after as the update focuses more on overhauling systems found in the base game.


Although both have been advertised alongside each other, they launch on separate
dates, with the update coming on September 21. A new trailer for the update highlights the
revamped police system, adding functioning police to the game so that committing crimes
has consequences. There's even proper MaxTac implementation in case a rampage gets so extreme the NCPD believes V has gone cyberpsycho.




Other prominent features in Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 include a rebuilt cyberware system and
retooled skill trees to better balance V’s capabilities. Hopefully, this version is the best as this marks the second time the skill trees have been redone.


Cyberpunk 2077 has been on a long road to redemption since its disastrous 2020 launch. The
game has always had its defenders, but the numerous bugs and missing features made it hard
to enjoy.


Now that it's becoming what it arguably should have been, the hype for it feels real again. While
more tempered than its original pre-release cycle, Cyberpunk 2077 has become something to
be excited about again. It still has some bugs and issues, but not nearly to the same degree it used to have.


It’s a redemptive arc that places it along other initial disasters like No Man’s Sky or Final
Fantasy XIV which eventually sorted itself out. Hopefully, this update will solidify its
placement among titles that rose amidst the ashes.

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, today’s Nintendo Direct was pretty cool, but the fun isn’t over for RPG fans. And on a day that saw an update for the Super Mario RPG remake and a Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door announcement, that’s saying something. Square Enix has released a demo for the upcoming Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince for Nintendo Switch, which you can download right now on the eShop.


Funnily enough, this appears to have had no English announcement of any kind. It just kind of appeared, with the assumption that RPG turbo nerds like me would just notice regardless. And I mean… I guess I am writing this, so that worked.


While you can import your demo save data over to the full version of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, this one comes with a few catches. While monsters you capture/synthesize will carry over, their levels and stats won’t. Perhaps this is to prevent people from over-leveling in the demo and trivializing the full game, we can’t say for sure. On the plus side, the demo will still allow you to explore and capture monsters after you clear the available story content. That’s a nice touch for those who just want to dive into the mechanics here.


I have so many good memories of playing Dragon Warrior Monsters on Game Boy. The Dragon Quest Monsters subseries has been dormant for Western audiences for a while now, so I’m hoping this one will deliver. At the very least, a demo will give us a good indication of how this one is shaping up.


Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince will launch on Nintendo Switch on December 1, 2023,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was "fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

        <updated>2023-09-14T16:39:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The many, many heroes of Eiyuden are gearing up for their debut. Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes will launch on April 23, 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.


Announced during today's Nintendo Direct, Rabbit and Bear Studios' RPG successor to the Suikoden series is locked in for release. Originally planned for this year, Hundred Heroes was pushed back to Q2 2024 for extra development time.


How's that panning out? Well, today's trailer certainly makes Eiyuden Chronicle look promising, to say the least. The video spotlights protagonists Nowa, Seign, and Marisa, as well as tons of characters to recruit and team-up attacks.




There's also a home base to build out and fill with your growing roster of companions, as befitting a follow-up to Suikoden. Those, plus special attacks like the Magical Girl technique we saw and a pirate shark too, make it look like there's a lot of variety in the cast.


Assembling the heroes


Eiyuden Chronicle has been in development for a while, since its Kickstarter accrued a massive amount of cash back in 2020. Developed by Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama under Rabbit and Bear, Eiyuden has looked more and more like a return to the format's roots with each new glimpse.


And even in its spin-off, the Eiyuden pitch has looked promising. 2022's Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising was a pleasant surprise, setting the stage for Hundred Heroes while focusing on a more action-RPG take. Much like Bloodstained prepared the way for Ritual of the Night with Curse of the Moon, Rising has me eager to see Hundred Heroes arrive.


Thankfully, it's not far off. Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is setting an April date in an increasingly stacked 2024, but I'll definitely find a way to make some time. Hopefully the revival goes well when Hundred Heroes hits Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on April 23, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All this debacle surrounding Unity's upcoming Runtime Fee has caused a major stir, especially among developers. This includes none other than Facepunch Studios, best known for Garry's Mod and the brutal survival game Rust.


In a statement on Garry Newman's (not that one) blog, the founder of Facepunch has outright said that Unity can now "get f*cked." This alone pretty much spells out how most people feel about what's going on with the popular game engine at the moment.




Newman expands on this by saying that there's trust has now been broken between Unity and pretty much every developer that uses its toolkit. The post then concludes by saying: "Rust 2 definitely won't be a Unity game"


Does this mean a follow-up is in development?


It's difficult to not take this as an off-the-cuff way of confirming that Rust 2 is in the pipeline. It could well have just been Newman letting off some steam by saying that any future projects will not be utilizing Unity products.


As such, we can't say for definite whether a Rust follow-up is in development. It could well be that Facepunch Studios is looking to do a sequel of its popular PvP/PvE/PvLE (Player vs. Literally Everything - that one's mine) title. We'll have to just keep an eye on whether this gets elaborated on in the future.


The general takeaway from Newman's post is that nobody is happy with the direction Unity is currently heading in. Seemingly, the reasons are obvious to everyone but Unity itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Nintendo Direct has come and gone. The company laid out not just the holiday season ahead, but a pretty good chunk of the next year too, for the Switch in today's September 2023 Nintendo Direct.


Today's stream held a decent mix of surprises and familiar faces, and the Switch maker saved a big gun for last with the Paper Mario announcement. Really, few are feasting as well as Mario RPG fans right now.




It was quite the trailer-filled Direct though, so if you missed any of the highlights, here's the full rundown and recap of the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. Let's chat about some trailers, shall we?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake of the NES classic.
The September Nintendo Direct showcase was packed full of remakes and remasters, though one of those joining the pile that we are rather excited about is Contra: Operation Galuga, which will be updating the 1980s NES classic for Switch in early 2024.
The updates applied to this one seem really quite impressive. Perhaps most noticeable is the remastered visuals and graphics which are looking particularly tasty, but you combine that with new stages, enemies, bosses, an updated weapons system and co-op for two players in Story Mode and four players in Arcade Mode, and we'd say publisher Konami is onto something special here.

If you've had your finger on the pulse over the last few months, then you may have heard of Dave the Diver, a game all about catching fish and managing a sushi restaurant. it's been a hit with fans and critics alike, and in today's Nintendo Direct, Mintrocket's indie hit was revealed to be coming to Switch on 26th October.
Dave the Diver is a lot of different things — a management sim, an action-adventure, an RPG, it kight be easier to say what it isn't! But what we've heard is that it's a lot of fun, blending lots of complex systems such as cooking, boss fights, and restaurant managing, with a relaxing vibe.

I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. 


Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wargroove 2, the sequel to the top-down strategy game Wargroove received a brand new trailer and a release date in today’s Nintendo Direct. According to the new trailer, Wargroove 2 is set to release next month, on October 5.




The trailer spends some time highlighting the game’s story, which involves a set of “mysterious new factions” that players must contend with. Wargroove 2 allows players to “command the land, sea & sky” in their pursuit of total victory. Also, the trailer takes a moment to focus on “supercharged grooves,” which are akin to final blows that are unique to each Commander, including “Powerful Form,” “Raise Dead,” and “Chain Reaction.” 


In addition, Wargroove 2 lets players upgrade their unit with a variety of items that can seemingly be found in active battle. In the trailer, for example, a character locates and pulls a sword from the ground whilst in the middle of active combat. It would seem that Wargroove 2 will also allow players to create their own maps, campaigns, and cutscenes with a new system improved over the original Wargroove.


Wargroove 2 is set for release on October 5. It will be available on the Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the other side of the pond, Japan's version of the Nintendo Direct gave us some details on the game that Onion Games has been teasing for a while now. Titled Stray Children, it looks like a return to Yoshiro Kimura's roots at Love-de-Lic, as the style is extremely evocative of Moon: Remix RPG Adventure.


Onion Games has been teasing a new "RPG-style" title for a while now but has been extremely coy about showing anything off. To date, I think the most we've seen is some concept art. Getting to see the game in motion; it's exactly what I was hoping for. Better yet, the opening seems to show the protagonist as a lover of video games that gets sucked into another world through the TV screen. That's speaking my language.




While the trailer shows off an RPG-like battle set-up, one of the menu items allows you to talk to your enemy. Knowing the sort of joy-maker games that Yoshiro Kimura favors, it's likely that you're supposed to befriend enemies. It has a lot of the same sights and sounds of a typical Love-de-Lic affair, and the trailer mentions that staff from Moon: Remix RPG Adventure are working on this one. I'm unsure if that refers specifically to Kimura, but that would qualify.


The best news of all is that the trailer gives us a Japanese release window for Stray Children, and it's soon: this Winter. While the trailer is entirely in Japanese, Onion Games has stated that it will be coming to the West. The bad news, however, is that its release over here is still "TBD."

After being initially revealed in the February Direct, Nintendo has today given us a closer look at Luigi's Mansion 2 HD for the Switch, confirming that it will be creeping our way in summer 2024.
This is the same 3DS game that we all fell in love with back in 2013 (gosh, was that really 10 years ago?) but with some added bells and whistles for the Switch version. It's apparent that Luigi has had something of a facelift for this HD remaster with its improved visuals and up to four ghost hunters can team up in the game's multiplayer mode.

It centers on Nunu and Willump as they adventure through the dangerous wilds of Freljord. You'll have to climb to get around some areas, and when there's an icy slope, Nunu can use Willump as a sleigh. There'll also be puzzles to solve as you learn more about these friends and their past. 




We've had a sneak-peak at the game before and saw that we'll be crossing paths with Braum the protector of the Freljord. We also learned that Nunu and Willump are searching for the Heart of the Blue. 


The single-player game is being developed by Tequila Works and published by Riot Games. You'll be able to grab it on the Switch and PC on November 1, 2023. Pre-orders are available now.

Diddy made his Mario Kart debut in Double Dash!!, and Funky Kong first appeared in Mario Kari Wii. But both Pauline and Peachette have only been seen in Mario Kart Tour, so this will be the first time they're playable in a console kart game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the more unexpected reveals during the September 2023 Nintendo Direct is Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story. The cozy-looking pixel-crafting RPG is in development by Lazy Bear, the studio behind Graveyard Keeper and Punch Club.




Bandle Tale takes place in the League of Legends region of Bandle City. Players will take on the role of a Yordle looking to restore the magic to Bandle City. With the help of familiar Yordle friends like Teemo, Lulu, and Tristana, the player will gather resources and craft a plethora of items to build up their city.


The crafting RPG looks great and reminds me a lot of Stardew Valley. There's something about well-done pixel art when it comes to this type of game. There's been a ton of games released lately that take place in the League of Legends universe, some of which have been great and others that have been average. Hopefully, Bandle Tale turns out to be a solid addition to the genre on Switch.


Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2024. You can wishlist it now on the Nintendo Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has Nintendo finally remembered Mario RPGs were, and still are, widely beloved titles? It appears like this may be the case, as Nintendo closed out today's Nintendo Direct by announcing the return of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.




No firm details were announced to go along with this. Still, we can at least get a feel for how the game will look in an HD environment. It seems like the plot details will remain intact, and the trailer music indicates we'll get some tasty rearrangements of the original's music. While I wish I had more to report here, I'm psyched to see this older style of Paper Mario earn a second chance. I've got my hopes up for this one!


I'm not quite sure whether this will veer closer to a remake or a remaster. Within minutes of this announcement, fans began combing over the trailer to spot anything that wasn't in the original game. For context, The Super Mario RPG remake announcement earlier this year didn't explicitly state new details either. We can't confirm much now, but we can at least hope.


Either way, we'll surely find out more as we approach the release of The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After many tracks and races along the way, the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass bonanza is finally coming to a close. The last wave, Wave 6, arrives this holiday with a whole kart-full of new racers in tow.


Shown during today's Nintendo Direct, Wave 6 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass will feature  four new racers pulled from the series' history, as well as a new circuit from the Wii entry.




Here's the full lineup of what's coming in the final wave:



Daisy Circuit (Mario Kart Wii)


Diddy Kong (Mario Kart Double Dash)


Funky Kong (Mario Kart Wii)


Pauline (Mario Kart Tour)


Peachette (Mario Kart Tour)



Seeing both Funky and Diddy Kong arrive isn't too surprising, but it's neat to see some of the Mario Kart Tour content make it here too before the Booster Course Pass closes out. The racer recently announced it was ending new content drops, so preserving some of that here in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is neat.


It's a pretty character-filled end to what's been a massive amount of content for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The kart racer was already one of, if not the best, to zip around and toss shells in. Seeing it continue to get these injections of content over the years felt like an added bonus.


We don't have a firm date yet for when these racers and the new circuit will arrive, outside of a holiday window. But as per usual, those with the Expansion Pack for Nintendo Switch Online can pick up the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass content at no additional cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trombone Champ, the infamous trombone-based rhythm game, will be available via Nintendo Switch “later today,” it was announced at today’s Nintendo Direct. Yes — that’s correct, the rhythm game that made its rounds in the meme space not long ago with poorly tuned renditions of The Blue Danube Waltz or Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is back, arguably on the platform it was always meant to be on.




According to the new trailer, the Switch version has support for gyro controls, allowing players to shift the pitch of their trombone up or down with the flick of their wrist. This can also be accomplished using the IR motion camera on the right JoyCon. In that mode, it would appear moving your hand closer to the sensor raises the pitch, while moving it further away lowers it.


In addition, this version of Trombone Champ supports local, four-player multiplayer, which … well, let’s just say that sounds like a very interesting experience and leave it at that. 


Trombone Champ will be available on Nintendo Switch later today, according to the new trailer.

But it wasn't all similarities, as the announcement also gave us our first look at the game's newest faction: The Faahri Republic. This learned group of mouse-folk might not be the best fighters out there, but they have more than enough brain power to assist your armies in battle — and just look at how cute they are!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that they're returning to the 99-player experience using the SNES version of F-Zero. F-Zero 99 is releasing today on Switch. 


I know we're all hoping for either a remaster of F-Zero GX or a new title entirely, but this is what we get. The flat, mode-7 landscapes are given new life by placing 99 players on them to fight for the lead. The boost meter from later games returns. Rather than being allotted a certain number of turbo boosts, like in the SNES game, it follows the system started in F-Zero X where you can sacrifice some of your shield to get a bit of extra speed.




A new feature has been added through "super sparks." They litter the track, and if you collect enough of them to fill your meter, you get sent up to the "Skyway." The skyway is a special track above the normal track that gives you the ability to try and get away from the human-clutter track and get ahead.


It might not be what we're hoping for, but I'm looking forward to trying it. It's nice to see Nintendo actually do something with the franchise beyond just telling us repeatedly that we can't have a new one. 


F-Zero 99 is available starting today on Switch. It's "free" for anyone with a Switch Online subscription.

She's been with us for decades, bringing us over a dozen games and plenty of films. You'll get to experience the adventures that started it all thanks to Tomb Raider I, II, III Remastered which will bring the first three games to the Nintendo Switch. 


The collection, developed by Aspyr, will include all the expansions and secret levels. You can expect upgraded visuals, though you'll be able to toggle to the original polygon look if you really want to crank up the nostalgia. 




If the collection remains faithful to the original games, it should include the following expansions: 



Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business


Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask


Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact



You can grab the collection on February 14, 2024. Pre-orders begin today.

Amazingly, a demo is out today! This is the perfect game for a demo, as you'll likely get sucked in and pre-order it right away. It'll be $19.99, just like the PC release.


Here are a few more details from developer Mintrocket: "Those who pre-order the game ahead of release will receive a bonus skin for Dave’s boat, plus an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. The skin adds a nostalgic 8-bit-themed design along the boat’s hull, while the lamp depicts Dave in this charming retro style!"

Finally, the time has come, and no, you aren't seeing things. Nintendo's Sora amiibo is the real deal, as revealed in today's direct, and will launch in 2024. For his Switch figure, Sora sports his original Kingdom Hearts look, just as he does in Smash. He'll look perfectly out of place next to your Sephiroth and Cloud amiibo on the shelf.

The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom also got an update on its figures. Both Zelda and Ganondorf make their debut on November 3, 2023.

Finally, Nintendo announced new Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo launch on January 19, 2024. The next duo features another pair to collect, this time with Noah and Mio. They're another 2-pack, just like Pyra and Mythra from back in July.

Even if you aren't really itching to get your hands on a Sora amiibo, the latest Nintendo Direct showed off quite a few surprises. Games like Trace Memory saw an enhanced port announcement, and Super Mario RPG showed off new footage. Quite a big day for older games making a return to strut their stuff on the Switch.


For a full list of characters, including the Sora amiibo, Nintendo has its full lineup readily available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gather your most lavishly animated food and settle in for a new Vanillaware reveal. Unicorn Overlord is a fantasy tactics RPG arriving on March 8, 2024.


Vanillaware has told fantasy stories in games like Odin Sphere and tackled real-time strategy, like 13 Sentinels and GrimGrimoire, so this seems like a perfect union. The studio has previously tackled tactics in Grand Knights History for the PSP, but that particular game never got officially localized for the west.


Unicorn Overlord, meanwhile, has got some big classic tactics vibes, but with Vanillaware's signature approach to art. That means everything from gorgeously detailed characters and worlds to, I can only hope, incredible food. No one does food quite like Vanillaware.




There's an overworld exploration layer, as well as the on-the-ground action, where it looks like parties of units square off in tactical battles. It reminds me a bit of Ogre Battle 64, somehow.


Per the trailer's description, you'll traverse the world and build up an army with over 60 unique characters, building renown amid the five nations.


Really, just the pairing of fantasy tactics and Vanillaware alone had my interest. But strange name aside, Unicorn Overlord looks pretty fantastic in the footage we saw today. Hopefully that holds true as we near a release date on March 8, 2024.

In SaGa Emerald Beyond, players will venture across 17 mysterious worlds with their own branching stories. The RPG will have multiple endings and replayability as choices tell a unique tale with each playthrough.


SaGa: Emerald Beyond will launch on Nintendo Switch in 2024. You can wishlist it today on the Nintendo Store.

This mostly looks like a standard upscale job, with the note that you can bring four friends with you for some online multiplayer "across different multiplayer modes." Nintendo themselves calls this one "A visually enhanced version of Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon," so what we see is likely what we get. It does seem we'll hear more about this in the future, though, so your guess on the details is as good as mine.


We'll have to see what Luigi's Mansion 2 HD brings to the table when it launches during Summer 2024.

Anyway, Nintendo gave us a look at Contra: Operation Galuga, with a ton of details: it's a "thorough reimagining of the classic run-'n'-gun action game from the '80s, featuring modern graphics and sound, new stages, new enemies and bosses, new play mechanics, an updated weapons system."


Two player co-op for story mode and four player co-op for arcade mode are confirmed. Please be good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the latest Direct presentation, Nintendo announced Another Code — known as Trace Memory in North America — will launch as a new Nintendo Switch bundle as Another Code: Recollection next year.


According to Nintendo, the Another Code: Recollection package includes both the original DS game and its sequel and will be released on January 19, 2024. Both games are "fully enhanced" for the new experience, and the presentation included a lengthy trailer. 




The unreleased Wii sequel, Another Code: R - A Journey into Lost Memories, makes its debut in North America in this bundle, too. Originally, A Journey Into Lost Memories only launched in Europe and Japan.


For those unfamiliar, Trace Memory follows teenage protagonist Ashley as she searches for her father. As Ashley, you'll travel to Blood Edward island and search for pops, solving puzzles through her visions of the past and piecing together clues. 


Another Code: Recollection is already up for pre-order, and the full $59.99 price tag nets both games. 


Today's Nintendo Direct featured plenty of surprises for the Switch. Kingdom Hearts fans finally get their long-desired Sora amiibo, while the company also announced Luigi's Mansion 2 HD launches next summer, in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a really vague teaser in the last Nintendo Direct, Nintendo has revealed more details on the previously unnamed Princess Peach: Showtime.


Princess Peach: Showtime has the eponymous heroine going up against Grape and the Sour Bunch, which I absolutely love. It's set up as a series of stage plays, taking on different themes and providing Peach with a different transformation. A number of the transformations were shown off, including swashbuckler, patisserie, and detective, among others. Afterward, it was teased that there are more transformations beyond just what was shown.


While this isn't the first game Peach has headlined, she does look a little bit more capable this time around. I usually can't stand her vacuous damsel personality, so having her put on pants and swing a sword does something for me.




It's looking pretty good so far, but I don't think I fully grok what's going on. It sometimes looks like a platformer, and other times, it seems to have mini-games. Fun looking mini-games, at least. I'm down for cake decoration. By the looks of things, it's a situation-rush style of game, which I can totally get behind.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Nintendo Switch March 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, we got to see a few more details about the upcoming Super Mario RPG remake. Specifically, we got to see a few new features in the game that should mix things up for those who have memorized the original game.




First up, the way Action Commands work are a little differently now. For example, when you time your attacks perfectly with the requisite button press(es), you can hit the entire enemy party at once. Additionally, as you complete Action Commands, you'll fill a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will let your entire party carry out a Limit Break-style "Triple Move," which changes depending on your party composition. Super Mario RPG is basically Chrono Trigger now, I'm definitely not overselling this feature.


Additionally, you can now go back and rematch bosses as new postgame content. As you'd expect, these extra battles will tune up the difficulty compared to your original run. Super Mario RPG has a decent number of bosses, so we'll have to see how much these add to the game.


As an added tease, we can also see Mario using the Shiny Stone in front of that door in Monstro Town. It's safe to assume that the very Squaresoft superboss Culex will, in fact, return in this remake. I can't imagine the game without that fight, so maybe this was a given. Still, I'm dying to see how this encounter looks in HD.


Super Mario RPG will release on November 17, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The puzzling platformer Mario vs. Donkey Kong is heading to Switch. Nintendo confirms today that Mario vs. Donkey Kong is arriving on February 16, 2024.


The Game Boy Advance puzzler uses a toy-like aesthetic and focused on more puzzle-focused platforming. According to the trailer description, this is an "updated version" of the game. It's unclear which version of the MvDK action we're getting, though I'd hope it's the GBA version over some of the later iterations.




Alongside the solo puzzle solving, there's also local co-op to under take, as Mario and pals contend with Donkey Kong's levels. As DK has run off with all the clockwork tools, it looks like it's up to Mario and pals to get them back.


Per the trailer, observing and acting will be a key part of the game, as players move through the level trying to spot keys and carry them to the door around the myriad obstacles. Mario vs. Donkey Kong also has a new look, with smoother visuals that remind me of the Super Mario RPG remake.


We don't know too much more at the moment, but it's cool to see Nintendo revive this handheld-era that pits Mario and Donkey Kong against each other. It's the oldest rivalry in gaming, and we should be watching them duke it out more.

Through a fairly detailed gameplay video, we got a look at the incredibly arcadey Side Order DLC (complete with damage numbers!), set at the "Spire of Order," which is basically an old-school challenge tower. It's meant to be played "over and over again," and will be a strictly single player affair.


Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC will be out in the Spring (!) of 2024.




Here's a gallery of everything shown off during the Direct.

Anyway, I like a kick, and I like a game that manages to actually be funny, and I have been playing Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands. You do the math(s).
I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[September is here, and it's time for the usual Nintendo Direct to show us what's going on this holiday season for the Switch. Nintendo's show goes live today, September 14, on their video channels.


The stream is expected to last around 40 minutes. The September 2023 Nintendo Direct will be talking mostly about games coming this winter for the Switch.




This is the usual time of year for a Direct, as Nintendo sets the stage ahead of both the Tokyo Game Show and the holiday season. As such, I'd expect we'll hear a bit about their pre-announced fall and winter lineup, including Super Mario RPG and WarioWare.


Still, I'm hoping for some more info on previous Direct reveals. Level-5 in particular had a big year in the Directs, with games like Fantasy Life i and Decapolice all being shown. Maybe we'll get to see updates on them today? Plus, anticipated indies like Metal Slug Tactics would be a fun surprise.


We'll see what Nintendo's got in store for the 2023 holiday season and more today. Hang out in the comments to chat about it if you'd like, and keep an eye on Dtoid for all the news and recap.

Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster are out today, and Gloomhaven launches on Switch on September 18.


The latter is a really interesting release, as it's a port of the digitized version of Gloomhaven proper: a massively successful board game Kickstarter that launched in 2017. Having played through the entire campaign I can attest to how fun it is with the right group, and while the digital version doesn't quite hit the same for me, it's fun to play through bite-sized missions on the go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom's classic dinosaur-themed survival sequel Dino Crisis 2 celebrated its 23rd birthday recently. Unfortunately, the developer has been unable to mark this momentous occasion without being drowned out by fans wanting a remake of the game.


In a post on Twitter, the Japanese Capcom account uploaded a simple image from Dino Crisis 2 along with a message about the game releasing on September 13, 2000.




Where a string of comments sending congratulations on reaching such a milestone should have been, people instead took the opportunity to ask Capcom whether the retro title would ever be remade.


So concerned with whether or not they could...


Currently, despite the swathe of Resident Evil games that have been given a new lease on life, Capcom has no plans to rejuvenate the Dino Crisis series.


Despite the dozens of comments asking the company to remake the second game (and the first, in fact), the studio has shown little interest in bringing it back.


Existing largely as a Resident Evil-esque franchise, the first two Dino Crisis entries enjoyed a fair amount of success back at the turn of the new millennium. There was a third game that was released in 2000 for the OG Xbox system, as well as a light-gun spin-off called Dino Stalker. Neither of these were received favorably.


But with the success that Capcom has been experiencing with RE remakes, and with a lot of demand, it's clear that fans would like to see either Dino Crisis or Dino Crisis 2 get another stab in the gaming world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hope you like walls of endless text.
Gaming often takes itself entirely too seriously. There aren’t enough games that embrace ridiculous, silly ideas and run with them without coming across as shallow and one-note. Mugen Souls Z half succeeds at this; its opening scene includes a spaceship transforming into a giant robot for an epic space battle and it only gets weirder from there. It just gets in its own way far too often for anyone to enjoy the silliness.
A sequel to 2012’s Mugen Souls, Mugen Souls Z first made its way to consoles a year later. Now fans can dive into this endearingly strange world as Chou-Chou, the so-called undisputed goddess who captured seven worlds in the first game, sets her adorable sights on a new set of worlds to conquer. This time, though, she’s been stripped of her powers so a new goddess named Syrma has to throw other deities into a mysterious coffin to drain away their powers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

If you're anything like us, then Poncle's brilliantly addictive Vampire Survivors has probably taken up a fair amount of your time since it was released last month. Many of the tension-rising tunes from the game's soundtrack are probably firmly stuck in your head by this point (we know that they are for us), so we were pleased to see some of the biggest numbers get the live orchestra treatment at the Save And Sound video game music event.
Initially written by Daniele Zandara, with contributions from Filippo Vicarelli and William Davis, the 56-piece orchestra took on several pieces of the monster-mashing music and the results are fantastic. What's more, they're all available to watch on the Poncle YouTube channel.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, has it really been almost half a year since we've done one of these? Apologies, readers. I honestly don't know where the time goes. It's probably because we're spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet isn’t fun anymore. Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 outfit Remedy Entertainment have "always" felt pressured to make their games longer, creative director Sam Lake has observed in a new interview which also picks apart the differences between the forthcoming midwestern spookalot, out this October, and the 2010 original. Lake added that, Remedy's sense of audience expectations notwithstanding, he himself has difficulty setting aside hours for longer games. "[It's] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through," he said. "So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Creative Assembly and SEGA's Total War: PHARAOH has a release date, 11th October 2023. There's also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game's campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.


In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error," Total War: Pharaoh's game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year's Gamescom. "And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1440p 144Hz monitors have been the most popular category for PC gamers for a little while now, offering a good blend of detail and responsiveness, and over time we've seen what was once a £500+ spec drift down to below £300. It's still rare to see a good example closer to £200 though, and that's exactly what we've got today: a 27-inch model from system integrators AWD-IT, the X= XRGB27WQ, available for £210 after a £70 discount.

I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

It makes sense that Bethesda would have tapped him up to take the mick out of Starfield, then, given it combines both those tropes into a mockable whole.

It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised, I have returned from the Starfield fields for an extended look at its PC performance and settings. And what a journey it’s been – there was the drama-tinged DLSS mod, the crap Steam Deck showing, the streaming workaround for said crap Steam Deck showing, and even the first recorded instance (I think?) of a game utterly refusing to work on a hard drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, Islands Of Insight is, somehow, both an open world multiplayer game, and a puzzle game - something akin to The Witness but in a fantasy world you share with other players. There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confession time: if you've been keeping up to date with Colossal Order's feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you're probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

Planet management. Lotsa menus. Expanding factions, sometimes peacefully if you prefer a clear conscience.

Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

It mostly adds new content for previously added modes, including 75 Challenges, six Arenas, two Outfits and 27 cheats and modifiers. There is also a new Custom Mode, however, which lets you "play and replay the Arena Challenges with your own twist."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe it was replaying Aperture Desk Job for the RPS Game Club, or maybe it was the sheer scale of Baldur's Gate 3 activating the ol’ fight-or-flight. Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

We got code late due to an unknown random happenstance, but we've now put a bunch of time into playing it so can have a blimmin' great chat about Bethesda's space RPG. I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. How was Baldur's Gate 3 August for you? Ready for Starfield September? I hope you are, because lemme tell you, it's coming all right. In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space. The medium frontier. These are the voyages of me, reviewing Bethesda's big space RPG Starfield. It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then I think back to my first experience of Fortnite, back in the dingy early-mid 2010s - a clever but laborious wave defence game inspired by Minecraft and CliffyB's childhood memories of building sofa cushion forts. I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder. What fresh hell is this, Epic? When will enough be enough?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sad news vis-a-vis playing Starfield on the Steam Deck: it runs like a slug, even on the lowest possible settings. And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
