It’s a gaming laptop with specs, price and performance that are so straight down the middle of the road that they might as well be studded with cat’s eyes. Apologies in advance if this is not the most action-packed hardware review you’ve ever read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.
The game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has officially revealed Project Q, a multiplayer arena battler that leaked last year. 
In September 2021, a list of upcoming PC games was datamined and leaked from Nvidia’s GeForce Now. As Eurogamer reported at the time, Project Q was one of four codenamed titles listed by Ubisoft, who issued a DCMA takedown of the list once it hit online.  
The French publisher confirmed Project Q’s existence on Twitter on Saturday, stating that the game is in early development and that players can register for upcoming gameplay tests. The timeframe for these tests is unknown. Ubisoft subsequently clarified in the same Twitter thread that Project Q is not a battle royale and will feature several PvP modes. It also states there are no plans to add NFTs to the game, evidently a concern given Ubisoft’s enthusiastic foray into the concept with its ill-received Quartz platform. 
So, we heard you heard... 🤷

April 23, 2022
Leaked playtest footage from Exputer shows a couple of matches from the game. It appears to be a colorful third-person shooter not unlike Fortnite with zany weapons such as a fireworks gun and melee items such as a staff and even Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir. 
According to Project Q’s registration site, the game is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Ubisoft Connect. It does not have a release window.  
In other recent Ubisoft news, several private firms are apparently looking to acquire the publisher. In terms of other new multiplayer titles, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development.]]></summary>

Note: This review is based on the Japanese release — the game launches in North America and Europe on 24th June 2022.
Pocky & Rocky, a Super Nintendo top-down run-and-gun, was developer Natsume’s gold standard, fondly remembered for its taut arcade action, adventurous stage design, and beautiful visuals. Where Tengo Project’s Wild Guns Reloaded and Ninja Warriors Once Again were deliciously pumped-up remasters, Pocky & Rocky Reshrined is a re-envisioning so markedly different from the original that it’s essentially an entirely new game. Completely redrawn from the ground up, it’s nothing short of magical from the flute note ditty that dials-in the opening title screen to the first stretch of road and beyond. Fallen leaves are displaced as you skid across them, floating back down to settle on the cobbles; weather effects desaturate the world with sepia flashes; the special effects, particularly surrounding boss entrances, are dazzling.

Final Fantasy VI merchandise has up jumping out of our seats in excitement. The much-beloved sixth entry in the legendary Final Fantasy series — which celebrates its 35th anniversary this year — rarely gets much attention from Square Enix. That's despite a successful PC and mobile remaster earlier this year as part of the Pixel Remaster series, which we desperately want on the Switch.
Well, perhaps there's a reason there hasn't been much merch for Final Fantasy VI — for one big blow-out celebration. Square Enix has unveiled an utterly gorgeous statue of one of the game's main protagonists, Terra, atop a Magitek armour. It's a recreation of the game's iconic logo, crafted in stunning detail.

However, despite this, Ubisoft hasn’t reportedly entered into serious talks or negotiation proceedings with these potential purchasers and Bloomberg’s sources say it’s unclear whether Ubisoft’s major shareholder is even wiling to pursue a transaction such as this in the first place.

The NPD results, which cover game sales in the US along with a lot of other data, are now emerging for March. Nintendo published or distributed two notable titles last month, and their results were mixed.
Though the full public data isn't due until 26th April, Axios writer Stephen Totilo has shared the non-mobile gaming chart (covering Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and of course Switch), which is based on dollar sales. It's worth nothing that Nintendo doesn't share its eShop data, so those download sales won't contribute.

Spice Wars is as much 4X as the dead eyes of two smiley faces, and one with enough forward momentum as to make such tantalising lies unnecessary. Embrace your grand strategy!

Raven Software quality assurance workers at Activision Blizzard will get the chance to vote whether or not to unionize starting this month, after a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board. 
This news comes by way of Polygon, which reports that the NLRB ruled Friday that the 21-person QA unit in question is eligible to unionize after Raven’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, challenged the effort, attempting to make it so that the entire 230-person team must vote on the decision. Now, the 21 people in question can begin voting once ballots, which are going to be mailed out on April 29, have been received. The ballots will be counted on May 23 and if a supermajority of yes is reached, the Game Workers Alliance union will be official and can begin negotiations with A…]]></summary>

It feels like every single month there's news of a new video game company acquisition. This year alone, we've seen Microsoft absorb Activision Blizzard, Sony buy former-Halo developer Bungie, Take-Two acquire the keys to Farmville developer, and Epic Games bring in Brazilian developer Aquiris. Now, there's another major acquisition rumour swirling around the industry.

Soapbox: Don't Cheer For Corporate Takeovers - It's Not A Game

Ubisoft — the hugely renowned publisher who has recently brought Immortals Fenyx Rising, Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection, and Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle to Switch — is reportedly being eyed up by a number of equity firms. Bloomberg reports that these firms include Blackstone and KKR, both of which have formally invested in gaming and technology-related companies.

When the Wii was launched alongside its iconic bundled game Wii Sports (apart from in Japan, where it was sold separately), trailers showed games of all ages and types getting off their butts and swinging a remote around. The Switch was able to recapture that a little in this generation, with Ring Fit Adventure proving to be a modern spiritual successor to Wii Fit, in particular.
The arrival of Nintendo Switch Sports this week will bring us a third generation of controller waving sport; don't forget Wii Sports Club on Wii U! Arriving over five years after the system launched, its place in the library is a little different as a result, and in the latest Japanese commercial we see Nintendo tying the game to Ring Fit Adventure as a natural part of an exercise routine. We see the player wrap up some exercises before jumping into an online match of badminton (and taking it quite seriously, too).

Diablo Immortal was revealed by Blizzard Entertainment four years ago, in 2018, and when it was announced, it was said to be a mobile-only game for iOS and Android devices. That remained the case for quite some time, but in recent betas, the team came to realize that if it truly wanted to embrace the spirit of bringing a Diablo experience to more players than ever before, Diablo Immortal needed to come to PC, too. And now, Blizzard has announced that it is, and the team has revealed an official release date, too. More specifically, it will hit iOS a…]]></summary>

Blizzard has revealed that its Diablo MMOARPG, Diablo Immortal, will finally be released to mobile devices on June 2 and in a surprise announcement, it will hit PC in open beta on the same day. 
First announced in 2018, Diablo Immortal is not just the first Diablo game to hit mobile devices – iOS and Android – but it’s also the first MMO for the series. Blizzard has also revealed that Diablo Immortal will feature crossplay and cross-progression on day one, meaning you can end a session on PC and pick right back up where you were on your mobile device. Diablo Immortal will be available on June 2 in most regions, with some Asia-Pacific regions gaining access a few weeks later.

We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.]]></summary>

It is TikTok's text-to-speech voice, and it is everywhere. Now it's even in Half-Life, thanks to a mod which replaces the opening tram ride voiceover with a TikTok TTS version. It's a distressing artifact, and I hate that it kinda works. See/hear for yourself in the video below.

Hideo Kojima games not only feature the creator's name a few hundred times, they're also well known for being loaded with licensed content. This can be in the form of iconic music or even video clips to tie games into real history, a clever bit of storytelling often deployed in the Metal Gear series. Of course, licensed content often has an agreement expiry date, which impacted a number of legacy Metal Gear releases last year.
Among many other versions across different systems, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D dropped off the 3DS eShop last November. It disappeared on 8th November last year - Konami cited "historical archive footage" as the issue and promised it was a temporary measure, though having checked this morning the game is still missing on the EU eShop. It's unclear whether Konami plans to replace the footage in the game, negotiate renewals for the footage or simply do nothing and hope no-one notices.

Wii Sports has a heck of a legacy behind it. Packaged with the Wii console at launch, it's the best-selling single-platform game of all time, as well as the fourth best-selling game ever, behind only Tetris, Gran Theft Auto V, and Minecraft. Wrap your head around that.
It's no surprise, really. Being included with Nintendo's second-best-selling home console of all time (the Switch only overtook it last year), the Wii has shifted more than 100 million units in its lifetime. And if someone had a Wii, it was likely that they also had Wii Sports. The universality of Wii Sports was unstoppable. Motion controls certainly had their... off moments, but Wii Sports embraced the ease of swinging a Wii Remote around. You could play it, your parents could play it, your grandparents could probably thrash you at bowling — everyone could play it. It embraced Nintendo's family-friendly philosophy better than almost anything else before it.

Right behind the newest LEGO game is FIFA 22, with a few Switch favourites — Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — creeping up a couple of places.

We've had a great time over the last four days, but alas, it's time for us to head back home to the RPS Treehouse, find a nice cosy corner, and sleep for 100 years. Before we do that, though, here's our final daly round-up video, which is all about games, games, games. Enjoy!

Not only did they construct an entire walled city to hark back to its iconic, titular location, but they also had an enormous Nautiloid crashed into the top of it. There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more.

What?? You want more?!? Oh, god. Okay. It's just that there are so many of these games and so little more to say about them. We speak the truth, though, when we deem Blast Brigade to be good. It is a strong effort in all respects and we will endeavour to expand on that forthwith. That means now. Stop looking at this paragraph, it's in the next one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WATAAARGH.
The game industry is youthful compared to other areas of entertainment and recorded culture - younger than film and TV, and of course a baby compared to printed works. Yet we're now decades into the history of gaming, especially if you go back to the systems of the 1970s, perhaps even a little earlier. Even if you choose to focus on the 'modern' post-crash era of gaming, we're rapidly approaching 40 years within that narrower perspective.
We see this every day as fans, of course - franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog are over 30-35 years old. We have commemorative products and re-releases on a regular basis, and the way we appreciate and consume retro games is also continually evolving.

Pitting the US box art against the Japanese box art, you fine folks were quite clear in your preference for the more classy, understated design of the US version. With its gold background and iconic logo design, it pulled in 65% of the vote - well done, golden boy!

Monolith Soft's JRPG series Xenoblade Chronicles is known for revealing a bit of skin from time to time, and it seems the third entry will be no different. According to a recent ESRB rating, which was discovered earlier this week, players will need to be prepared for an adventure containing blood and violence, swearing and suggestive themes.
One section of the classification, in particular, that seems to be getting some attention in certain corners of the internet (namely Twitter) is the "revealing armor" - with character and creature designs that will feature "deep cleavage" and "partially exposed breasts". Again, there'll be swearing and violence as well. Here's the full summary:

If you're still not entirely convinced, Modern Vintage Gamer has now taken a look in his latest YouTube video. In brief, he's also convinced the GBA emulator codenamed "Sloop" was also developed by Nintendo, or at least NERD (aka the Nintendo European Research & Development team).

We also caught up with Larian to chat about Baldur's Gate 3 (watch out for a dedicated video coming in the next day or two), and we capped off the day by attending Shirley "Skyrim Grandma" Curry's panel over on the Bumblebee Theatre stage. I'll be writing up a separate post about this in the coming days, but needless to say, Shirley was an absolute delight.

Super Mario Galaxy is easily one of the best 3D Mario games and was a hit when it was originally released on the Wii in 2007. Have you ever wondered what it would look like if this game was made available on the Nintendo DS instead?
While there's been hoaxes and more in the past, as you might recall - there's now a fan project out there actually making this dream a reality. We covered it here on Nintendo Life last year in June - showing off footage of this custom build which was shared by the YouTube channel Jesse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first McPixel was one of those point and click adventures that was just so wholesomely silly that it won you over with its mix of daft humour and bonkers, quickfire 'save the day' scenarios. Now, everyone's favourite bomb disposal expert is back in McPixel 3 (solo developer Sos Sosowski prefers we never mention the likes of McPixel 2), which we got to see in action over at the Devolver booth at PAX East 2022. Sosowski took the reins for us in this demo, showing us exactly how not to save the world in this equally comedic sequel, proving that the McPixel formula is still just as potent ten years on from the original.

Moderated by Overclocking.TV's Isaïe "Trouffman" Simonnet with special guests Joe Gialanella from ModMyMods, Eric "hobbseltoff" Hobbs from PC Modding Enthusiast, and Justin "Robeytech" Robey, these four experts took us through the history of PC modding over the last 15 years, the highs and lows of some of their very own builds, and what lies in store for PC modding going forward. It was a fascinating panel, and we caught up with Simonnet afterwards to try and recapture some of that excellent hardware chat for you folks at home.

Hypnospace Outlaw is a simulation game made by Jay Tholen, Corey Cochran, and Xalavier Nelson Jr. in which you play an enforcer of rules on "Hypnospace", a '90s-style version of the internet that happens while you sleep. In your role, you come across a teenage boy named ZANE_ROCKS_14, who is constantly breaking the rules about copyright infringement and harassment because he really wants the world to know about his favourite bands, his terrible self-authored comics about himself as a superhero, and his made-up girlfriend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. We kick things off by examining their debut outing, Bastion.
Bastion launched on Xbox Live Arcade on July 20, 2011, and was created by a ragtag team of seven friends that formed the core of Supergiant (all of whom remain at the studio today). Developed under two years entirely in co-founder Amir Rao's father's living room, Bastion gave the upstart team a chance to create the game of their dreams after spending years working for triple-A studios. We'll discuss Bastion's unorthodox development cycle (it had no pre-production phase), the origins of beloved elements such as its narrator and soundtrack, and how the game's success launched Supergiant into stardom.  
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Prima Games staff writer Jesse Vitelli (@jessevitelli) for an entertaining and informative chat about the history and narrative of Bastion! You can also decide which one of us does the best narrator impression.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and the bois.
The Last Friend places you in control of Alpha, a strong and silent protagonist who travels a wasteland in a decked-out RV with a pack of his best friends. His best friends, of course, are dogs. Their leader is a spicy little chihuahua named T. Juan who does all the talking on behalf of the gang, and together Alpha and the pack fight off a horde of Mad Max-esque frat bros who have imprisoned dozens of dogs because… whatever, it doesn’t matter. The Last Friend's plot is nonsensical, but in the best of ways, and it’s really just there as set dressing to give some goofy context to the gameplay.
Each stage has you playing in a Plants vs. Zombies-like tower defense map, where your vulnerable RV is parked on the left and it’s up to Alpha and the goodest of bois to keep the frat bros attacking from the right from trashing it. You always have direct control over Alpha, who can freely jump between the three-to-five lanes in each level, beating up bad guys and ordering the dogs where to build their defenses. Every felled enemy will drop some scrap, which you can then spend on constructing more dog units or to upgrade existing ones. It’s a simple but effective system, buoyed by both the diversity of dog types on offer and the fast-paced action offered by Alpha’s controls. If you don’t want to wait for the dogs to do all the work, Alpha has a series of basic beat ‘em up-style combo attacks for putting down foes quicker.

Phew! It's been a heck of a week, hasn't it? It actually feels like springtime now at least, but our eyes are poised towards the summer with the slate of new release dates we've been handed. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has been brought forward from September to July! Unprecedented stuff. Splatoon 3 also finally has a release date — a very neat 9th September. Oh, and Sonic Origins is also locked in for 23rd June, but not without some controversy over those pre-orders. And, even though it's been rumoured for ages, we've got more concrete proof that Game Boy and GBA games will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online at some point, probably.
Now it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

Instead of plonking ourselves in the middle of the empty show floor after hours, we snuck back into Devolver's booth to film our Friday catch-up, where we started our day some 10 hours beforehand. We got the lowdown on McPixel 3 from solo dev Sos Sosowski, and marvelled once again at the lovely overgrown arcade cabinets of reverse citybuilder Terra Nil. We then moved over to the Focus stand to play supernatural cowboy slayer Evil West and the ultra fast FPS Warstride Challenges. We also stopped by the Pinny Arcade communtiy meet-up today, and sat in on a couple of panels, including one about the history of PC hardware modding and a Wordle Royale. Find out exactly what that means in the video below.

We've just emerged from Gearbox's 80-minute panel at PAX East 2022, and we're wondering how they managed to spend so much time talking about so little. You know something's gone wrong in a conference when you've got an entire segment dedicated to just merch, and Gearbox groupies are hollering for Tiny Tina G-Fuel cans like it was mana from heaven. Lucky for you, we suffered through all the merch plugs, the failed trailer loads, nothing announcements and yet another 20-minute magic set to bring you this condensed version of Gearbox's panel news, all so you don't have to suffer through that interminably long stream. Here's everything you need to know from the Gearbox Main Theatre Show panel in 5 minutes.

These sort of monitors normally cost around $300, but today retailer Antonline is selling the well-reviewed Lenovo G27Q for just $200 - after a mega $150 reduction.

Blizzard had a big week, announcing the new World of Warcraft expansion Dragonflight (we have previews of it here and here) as well as detailing the character reworks coming in the Overwatch 2 beta. A Ghostbusters VR game was announced from Sony Pictures and nDreams, the new TMNT brawler has a release window, and Volition finally showed off Saints Row's suite of character customizations. On top of all of that huge news, one of our team has a big day today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corsair's ML (magnetic levitation) fans are a popular choice for system builders, thanks to their high RPM range, good cooling performance and better durability than traditional designs. The latest edition is the RGB Elite, which offers improved acoustics over its predecessors, and it's this one that's been discounted at Amazon UK today. A triple pack with an iCUE Lighting Node Core normally costs £85, but today that price has dropped to £60 - a 29% percent reduction. I reckon this is a great shout if you're planning a new build or upgrading basic case fans, and in fact I've even placed an order for my own PC.

This week, Blizzard announced World of Warcraft's newest expansion, Dragonflight, showing off the new race and class combination, the Dracthyr Evoker, as well as the new lands players will be exploring in the long-hidden Dragon Isles. Some of the reveals this week weren't as flashy as playable transforming magical dragons. Yet, they do provide a better window into the philosophy and priorities of the World of Warcraft team in the immediate future. I spoke with Dragonflight senior game designer Jackie Wiley about the complete talents system rework coming to all classes in 10.0 as well as the big changes coming to professions.

The core of the experience involved decoding ancient languages to communicate with the Tower of Babel's silent residents and solve puzzles. The reveal trailer also showed off more traditional environmental puzzle-solving as well as some stealth; Chants of Sennar is a war of words, rather than fists. The game’s sharp art direction and a relaxing soundtrack lend the game both a soothing and mysterious atmosphere.

Enter The Dragon brings a load of streams lined up on Steam and over at Pixmain's Twitch channel to show off Chinese-developed indies like the spooky looking SCP: Secret Files, and plenty of demos to take a crack at. Think I’ll be installing My Time At Portia follow-up My Time At Sandrock and roguelike cyberpunk platformer Loopmancer this weekend.

It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.
It's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.

Dubbing Godzilla and Kong as ‘Titans’ of Universal Pictures’ Monsterverse, Call Of Duty is introducing the pair to the Caldera map in the time-limited Operation Monarch event beginning May 11th. According to the patch notes, Monarch is the name of the organisation that tracks down these cryptozoological Titans. Somehow there have been two movies starring the big ape-lad and the large dragon with bad breath now, one of which came out last year. I guess this is a tie-in to that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that the Halo series has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Episode one saw an exciting introduction to both the iconic Spartans and the brutal Covenant forces that seek to tear humanity apart. 
But then we got weeks of melodrama and ill-paced storylines that made us question if we wanted to continue with the show. Episode five, titled "Reckoning," is a stark reminder of why this series has so much potential, and we're breaking it all down on this special edition of The Game Informer Show!


Join Alex Stadnik and Andrew Reiner as they bring on Kate Sanchéz, EIC and entertainment critic for But Why Tho?, to discuss and spoil the fantastic battle and more from this week's entry in the Paramount Plus series. We start the proceedings off by gauging Kate's level of enjoyment for the show and blow through some of the other less exciting plot points to get to the good stuff.
We also touch on the thankfully brief encounters with Soren and Kwan as they trek through the desert, en route to Madrigal. While that storyline continues to suffer, it wasn't much of a deterrent, as the panel all walked away from this week's show excited for what's to come.
Programming Note: Our Episode six review will premiere on Monday, May 1, instead of the regular Friday timeslot. This is due to a particular video editor and his need to take a vacation. We appreciate your patience and look forward to continuing the series review!
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

Sony asked a court to dismiss this case in February, but that didn’t happen. Then, in March of this year, eight more claims of sexism experienced at the company’s U.S. offices were added to the case.

If you’ve been playing Call of Duty: Warzone lately, wondering to yourself, “this could really use some more kaiju,” then you’re in luck because that seems to be exactly what Operation Monarch is bringing to the battle royale. 
An Operation Monarch teaser trailer for Call of Duty: Warzone released today teases a climactic showdown between the famed King Kong and Godzilla, not unlike that seen in the 2021 movie, Godzilla vs. Kong. As for how this fight plays into the actual battle royale that is Call of Duty: Warzone, that remains unclear. Save for one of the Warzone planes going down after being grabbed out of the sky by King Kong, the soldiers we play as in the game are nowhere to be seen.
You can check out the teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Operation Monarch will go live on May 11, but hopefully before then, we learn more about how Godzilla and King Kong will actually affect Call of Duty: Warzone. Perhaps they’ll replace the ever-enclosing circle, or perhaps they’ll just be fighting in the background. Regardless, here’s hoping we get some cool skins and customization options related to the kaiju out of this. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Vanguard review and then read about how a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sequel and new Warzone game are confirmed for 2022. Check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was out with friends once and a person who was a mutual aquaintance with a pal, and who did something or other in theatre, looked at a couple of us with sad eyes and asked "What have you been doing recently to give your life meaning?"
I think your reaction to the idea of someone asking you that will predict your response to Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between, a self-described "surreal journey through the spaces between places". Do you think "what have you been doing to give your life meaning?" is a cool way to start a conversation? A better prompt than you'd normally encounter? A big question, rather than small talk? Then you will probably be more open to the delights of Glitchhikers, a game where where you talk about choice and predetermination to what appears to be sentient windchimes while driving along a one-way motorway. Where you take a nighttime walk around a park peopled with meditating animals who have opinions about magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released the latest batch of games to users subscribed to its Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack and this time, it’s three more Sega Genesis games. 
More specifically, you can now play Space Harrier II, Shining Force II, and Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball on your Switch through the service. These three games join the recently-added Sega Genesis games, Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermilion, and Thunder Force II, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, which was added to the service back in January. You can check out all three new Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack games in the trailer below: 


Space Harrier II
Space Harrier II was first released in 1988 and was one of the original launch titles for the Mega Drive (what the Sega Genesis was known as in Japan) and one of the six Sega Genesis launch titles in the U.S. Nintendo says Space Harrier II is “a celebrated launch title for the Genesis/Mega Drive,” and that “in this sequel to the popular 3D shoot-em-up, Harrier takes to the skies once more to defend Fantasy Land from a mysterious invader.” 
Shining Force II
Shining Force II is a tactical RPG released in 1993 and while it is a sequel for the franchise, it’s not a direct sequel to the first shining force. Nintendo says this “second entry in the popular tactical-RPG series” features “even more strategic combat.” In it, “Sir Astral’s squire, Bowie, must assemble an army of light from all the world’s races to stop evil from overtaking the land.” 
Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball
Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball is the first of the pinball-related spinoffs in the Sonic franchise. Originally released for the Mega Drive in 1993, Nintendo says “the world’s fastest hedgehog bursts onto the pinball scene in an all-new adventure,” and that “in this action pinball game anyone can pick up and enjoy, gather the Chaos Emeralds, and save four worlds from Dr. Robotnik.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wouldn’t be a Dungeons & Dragons event without an update on Baldur’s Gate 3 from Larian Studios, and last night’s D&D Direct finally confirmed that the game will burst forth from the skull of its early access form in 2023.


Larian’s CEO Swen Vincke didn’t make his usual armoured appearance for the announcement, unless you count his legs poking out from behind a desk. Get well soon, Swen. Larian have styled the release date announcement as a look back at Baldur’s Gate 3’s “journey so far” while it’s been in early access. It’s a bit daft, but neatly summarises how the game has evolved over the past two years.

In the latter category, first prize definitely goes to the trio of highly cursed doll babies scattered around the stand for Chernobylite, the post-apocalyptic survival horror roguelite that came out last year. They were also accompanied by two gas masks, casually strewn across the corners of TV screens, but nothing compared to the truly haunted look of these semi-melted plastic husks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no surprise that Gearbox is far from done with the Borderlands franchise following the release of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and with the forthcoming Borderlands movie in post-production. The company announced today a popular Borderlands spinoff is returning this year with the return of Tales from the Borderlands.
In a tweet this afternoon from the Borderlands official Twitter account, it was revealed that Tales from the Borderlands would be receiving a second season, and Gearbox only lists it and 2K Games as being attached to the project. The tweet reads, "There are more stories to explore in the Borderlands universe. An all-new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficail and @2K. Stay tuned for a full announcement this summer." The message came with a piece of art featuring three characters under the Borderlands logo with a big moon shining in the background.
There are more stories to explore in the #Borderlands universe. An all new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficial and @2K.

April 21, 2022
The previous developer for season one of Tales of the Borderlands, Telltale Games, isn't mentioned in the announcement, which makes sense as that company has taken more of a publishing role since it was shuttered and resurrected over the past few years. It's unknown whether this new edition of Tales from the Borderlands will continue on with characters from the first season or move on to other stories within the universe. 
Season one of Tales of the Borderlands is an adventure game following the exploits of former Hyperion employee Rhys and con artist Fiona in the rough yet humorous world of Pandora. You can read why former Game Informer editor Javy Gwaltney loves this game in this opinion piece describing how it's his favorite entry in the entire Borderlands series. We recently ranked the entire Borderlands series, and you can check out where Tales ranked on the list here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hullo chaps! Yes, it's another US processor deal, as there have been quite a few good ones recently. The 12700K is my personal pick of the new Intel 12th-gen family, as it offers the same number of performance cores and therefore much the same performance as the flagship 12900K - all while producing far less heat and costing much less too. It normally retails for around $385, but today a $45 discount code on Newegg brings it to just $340.

The Dragon Isles have been in the vocabulary of longtime WoW players as the home to the powerful dragon aspects and their dragonflights prior to the Burning Legion's invasion of Azeroth 10,000 years ago. Finally, after nearly two deca…]]></summary>

With 20 years of history behind it, beloved characters (both original and Disney’s), and more reminders of the importance of friendship and heart than in any other series, it’s hard to ignore the impact Kingdom Hearts has made in the gaming community. With that much history, though, comes plenty of highs and lows, and there are clear standouts as a result. The Game Info…]]></summary>

The enhanced edition of Outriders includes the base game along with every update and the New Horizon content. However, players who own the original game can upgrade to Worldslayer and seamlessly transfer their progress data. Existing players can bring their characters into Worldslayer, but if you’re looking to start from scratch, new characters can be boosted to level 30 to be readily available for the expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, an MMORPG that launched in Asian territories last year, heads to the west this summer. The game is a multiplayer take on Level-5 and Studio Ghibli’s whimsical universe made by developer Netmarble, and you can pre-register for free on mobile devices beginning today. 


Cross Worlds boasts a new story and the signature Studio Ghibli animation style from the first two titles (the game is made in Unreal Engine 4). The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. 
Players suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  
Pre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit. Joining the game’s Discord nets you the Catarumpus Hat and a special title. 
Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is slated to release stateside on iOS and Android in early summer. It will also be playable on PC.]]></summary>

That would be May 27 when old-school fans can get their hands on Kao’s new adventure. The revival sees the boxing marsupial on a journey to find his missing sister and discover the truth behind his father’s disappearance. A fresh trailer for the colorful action platformer sets the table for the story and gameplay.  


Kao the Kangaroo is the first installment in the series since 2005, which debuted on Dreamcast and appeared on PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PC over three games. PAX East attendees can play the game at developer Tate Multimedia’s booth this week.

Worldslayer is adding in new story content to the Outriders’ world of Enoch – always good to hear – and a new endgame. It all centres around the creepy original Altered, Erishkigal, who exudes some serious Zuul vibes and is named after the Sumerian goddess of the underworld. I googled it. With Worldslayer, People Can Fly say they're delving more into the extraterrestrial shenanigans of Enoch’s backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge finally has a release window, and the hotly-anticipated throwback is set to arrive sometime this summer. 
A new extended gameplay trailer shows off the game’s first two levels with all four Turtles getting a spotlight. Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge. The action gets another big dose of nostalgia with Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) spouting one-liners in the midst of battle as a result. 


Those attending PAX East this week have the opportunity to play Shedder’s Revenge for the first time at Dotemu’s expo hall booth (#12043, if you’re curious). The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Dotemu announced that Limited Run Games will produce physical copies of the digital-only title sometime after launch. Shredder's Revenge's soundtrack, composed by Tee Lopes, will get a digital release down the line as well.

The big highlight of this update is the new advanced class, the Glaivier. Lost Ark was taken offline for maintenance around 12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET and is expected to remain under maintenance for eight hours, meaning it should return online with the Glaivier and the big update in just a few hours.

Before that we have a big more egg chat to get out of the way, and a decent discussion on some of Henry Cavill's recent activities. Also I complain about how there are too many Marvel heroes now and they need to kill a load of them off. Plus, in exciting news Nate manages to do his first ever accurate impression, by accident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has revealed that the Shadowrun Trilogy is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch this summer. 
More specifically, the newly-remastered trilogy will hit these consoles on June 21. This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. 


“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” 
Shadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. 
Shadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99.

Glaivier is the new advanced class and she’s proper into orchestral djent judging by the trailer. The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other. It looks like she can really tear things up with superfast twizzles and dazzly stabbiness.

Not in the sense that is has nothing left to give, but that it feels ready to give even more. It's a rip-roaring blast through a cyberscape that doubles as a skatepark for your chainsaw leg. And amidst the sick grinds and spilling of guts you're drip fed weapons and power-ups that only serve to keep the momentum ticking over. You won't concentrate on anything harder in your lifetime. That's a guarantee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, will produce the movie treatment of Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that not only is Johnson producing the movie, but it is being developed by Amazon, seemingly set for an Amazon Prime Video release (or perhaps a theater premiere, which Amazon has done for some of its movies in the past). Johnson will produce the film on behalf of Seven Bucks Production, alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia, and dj2 Entertainment will help produce it as well. 


Variety reports that its sources say that Johnson could also star in the film, but that’s obviously not official yet. As expected, this film adaptation of 2021’s It Takes Two, which won Game Of The Year at The Game Awards 2021 in December, will follow main characters May and Cody who are turned into dolls by their daughter amidst divorce proceedings. May and Cody must work together to explore fantasized areas of their home to regain their bodies while confronting the issues of their relationship.
It’s one of the best games of 2021, and you can find out why in Game Informer’s It Takes Two review. The film could shape up to be just as good, based on the team behind it. Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller are adapting the game for the silver screen, according to Variety, and they will also serve as executive producers alongside Hazelight Studios’ Josef Fares, who directed the game version of It Takes Two. 
For more, read Game Informer’s It Takes Two review and then check out our thoughts on Fares’ other games, like A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale Of Two Sons.

Loopmancer is an upcoming cyberpunk time-looping action roguelite by eBrain Studio poised to slash its way to your living room this year. The game looks promising, and I got to test my mettle against a demo to see how well it’s shaping up. 
The story centers on a detective named Xiang Zixu, who gets killed during a mission tracking an underground crime lord. However, he awakens back in his apartment earlier that morning. That’s right, our officer is trapped in a mysterious loop, but he retains memories of his past “lives.” Figuring out the cause of this loop will be one of the core plot points, and eBrain…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-04-21T12:02:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has delayed Spider-Man: Across The Universe, the highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, from Oct. 7 to June 2, 2023. 
This marks a nearly eight-month delay for the animated sequel that is set to star Shameik Moore and Hailey Steinfeld as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively, as reported by Deadline. When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. 
As for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. 
Into The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. 
Deadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. 
While waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that. If you need even more comic book games in your life, watch this reveal of Insomniac’s Wolverine game.

Previously, the only way to update the wireless controller was the plug it into an actual PS5 – not a problem if you’ve managed to find one in stock, of course, but bad news if you bought the pad standalone to play on your PC.


Per Sony’s announcement tweet, you can download the app directly from the PlayStation site. 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11 are both supported, and using it is pretty easy: just connect the controller via its USB cable and click through a full steps. The single catch is you can only update one controller at a time.

Any other year, like the ones Survive was previously supposed to release in, that would be a perfectly reasonable date for a niche game with a cult following. But the announcement comes just a day after Nintendo…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we've learned anything from Marvel's comics and cinematic universe, it's that the world is always expanding. New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel's Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, a leaked release date of July 29 for the long-awaited Digimon Survive made the rounds on gaming websites and social media. Today, Bandai Namco made it official.
In a succinct video message, Digimon Survive producer Kazumasa Habu confirmed the July date, which appears to be the worldwide release given that pre-orders are now live on retail sites. Check out his message below. 


The release confirmation ends a long wait for Digimon fans; Survive was first announced in 2018 with a 2019 release window. The turn-based strategy game stars a group of teens who find their way to the Digital World, and their respective Digimon partners, during a school camping trip. Goggles-wearing protagonist Takuma Momozuka and his buddy Agumon lead this gang to rescue the world from an unknown threat. You can watch the recent English teaser trailer here. 
Digimon Survive will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster (and let's be honest, we all have), a new game from the minds at VR studio nDreams is bringing specter hunting to Meta Quest 2 to help you fulfill that fantasy. 
nDreams, the developers behind VR experiences like Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked, and Far Cry VR: Dive Into Insanity is partnering with Sony Pictures Virtual Reality to make Ghostbusters VR (working title) virtually a reality. This new Ghostbusting experience will let you team up with up to three friends in VR to track down the paranormal and blast them with your Proton Packs to trap them and take them back to your HQ. Players will run that headquarters in San Francisco, a city never explored in the Ghostbusters franchise. nDreams is promising an "expansive and engrossing" campaign that can be played alone or in co-op.


The trailer released today, while an in-engine cinematic, is not actual gameplay, but there are some hints as to what the game may look like when it's released, including fun character customizations like the cute animal hat worn by one of the 'Busters. 
There's no date on when the now-called Ghostbusters VR will hit Meta Quest 2, but a press release claims more information will become available in the coming months. But GBVR isn't the only Ghostbusters game in the works, as Illfonic's Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, an asymmetrical multiplayer title is coming later this year.]]></summary>

When we featured the upcoming Saints Row reboot on our cover last year, I was able to play around in the vast open world of Santo Ileso. There, I could explore freely, take part in story missions, complete side missions, and even expand the Saints' empire through the fun Criminal Ventures mission chains. However, one area I wasn't privy to was the customization suite, a significant part of the Saints Row package since its earliest days.

Following a 2019 reveal that had fans thinking Overwatch 2 was within reach, the development team at Blizzard went dark following a series of delays and departures of key team members (including Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan). As the development timeline stretched on, the once-abundant and enthusiastic player base showed signs of dwindling and discouragement as live-service support for the first Overwatch dried up.
However, last month, Blizzard emerged from its largely incommunicado state to reveal that Overwatch 2's PvP and PvE content has been decoupled and that it's holding a PvP beta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moss: Book II will only be a PlayStation VR exclusive for a short time because the adventure will soon be available on the Meta Quest 2 headset. Developer Polyarc announced during the Meta Quest Showcase today that Moss II would arrive on the platform this summer.
Moss II on Meta Quest 2 will have more freedom in the way it's played, according to Polyarc. The move to a newer headset like the Quest allows players to utilize both Quest controllers as opposed to a single DualShock controller like in the PS5/PS4 edition. Polyarc says it lets players perform actions such as engaging with the weapon inventory system during combat.
“One of the first things we heard when we launched Moss: Book II on PlayStation VR a few weeks ago was that the Quest 2 community wanted to play it, and we’re going to deliver on that in the very near future,” said Polyarc CEO Tam Armstrong, in a press release shared with Game Informer. “Our goal from day one has been getting the Moss franchise onto as many headsets as possible. We want all VR players to have the opportunity to experience the joy of physical interaction and power of the emotional resonance we’ve been building into the worlds we create. We’re excited to share our game with millions of Quest 2 players around the world this summer.”
An exact release date was not shared for Moss: Book II, but we can't wait to try it out on a Quest 2 sometime this summer. If you want to dig into Moss: Book II and have a PlayStation VR, the game is ready to download and play there.]]></summary>

It's a cute conceit and fun, especially because it treats the virtual tabletop as a physical space. Your own farm animal cards will unhelpfully jostle your setup as they roam, for example, and invading monster cards will chase your villager cards across the tabletop. It's all very pleasant, a little adventure to figure out how it all works then reach the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega formally unveiled Sonic Origins today, a remastered and enhanced collection of classic Sonic games arriving this June. It also revealed that the title comes in two editions along with a few pre-order bonus packs. 
The game’s website shares a chart (pictured above) breaking down each version of the game and various pre-order bonuses. If you’re having trouble making sense of it, we don't blame you. It's confusing at first glance, so here’s a plain breakdown of what it entails. 
The Standard Edition, which is just the game, costs $39.99. The Digital Deluxe version runs for $44.99 and includes the game plus the following items: 
Hard Missions
Letterbox background
Character animation in main menu
Camera controls over main menu islands
Character animations during music islands
Exclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles
With us so far? Good. Now, there are three content packs, two of which are unavailable for purchase at the moment. They are: 
Start Dash Pack (included with digital pre-orders of Standard or Digital Deluxe Editions)
100 Medallion bonus
Mirror Mode unlocked
Letterbox background (Genesis/Mega Drive Pattern)
Premium & Classic Sound Packs (Coming soon)
Exclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles
Premium Fun Pack (Coming soon)
Hard missions
Letterbox background
Character animation in main menu
Camera controls over main menu islands
Character animations during music islands
Basically, the Classic Sound and Fun Packs are just the bonuses included in the Digital Deluxe edition but slightly divided. Hopefully that helped you figure out what you're getting and where.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled the first trailer for Sonic Origins, the remastered collection of Sonic’s best Genesis-era titles first teased last May. 
Origins remasters Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3/Knuckles, and Sonic CD with the sharper resolution, new and improved animations, and fun tweaks such as the ability to play as Sonic's two sidekicks across any game. That’s right; you can finally smash through Sonic 1’s Marble Zone as Knuckles. 
If you’d rather keep it vintage, a Classic Mode lets players enjoy these games in their original forms. Conversely, Anniversary Mode features a full-screen display and infinite lives for those who want to tour each adventure stress-free. Sonic Origins incentivizes gameplay with new in-game missions that reward medallions. Spending this currency in the game’s Vault unlocks new content and grants access to a Special Stage. Origins also sports new cutscenes in the style of Sonic Mania's animated cinematics.


Sonic Origins launches on June 23 – Sonic’s 31st birthday – on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The Standard Edition runs for $39.99, but there are two versions and a few content packs you can read all about here.

There are a bunch of them, after all. But there hasn't yet been one that I think provides exactly what I want from a pirate game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has been out for less than a month and already, Gearbox has released the first DLC for it. 
Titled Coiled Captors, this DLC seems centered on some kind of snake creature or creatures that control what’s going on in the new locale within the fleshy prison of the Mirror of Mystery. This new area looks especially frozen, with plenty of icy terrain and frost-covered enemies to defeat.
You can watch the Coiled Captors launch trailer below: 


As you can see, it features more of the zany and wacky adventures those who have played Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands are already familiar with. The trailer also reveals that Coiled Captors comes with a new frozen dungeon and in it, you must free the “mad god.” Gearbox says each week, the challenge evolves with powerful new gear, wondrous new cosmetics, and more. 
Coiled Captors looks great, especially if you’re in need of new Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands content and fortunately, you don’t have to wait long, or at all really, because this DLC is available now. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands review and then check out all the details we know about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ season pass, which includes four content drops. Read about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Chaos Chamber endgame dungeon after that.

Then, we discuss some of Bruce's most iconic roles and the ones he was rumored to be in. He also settles whether or not he was ever actually in Spider-Man: No Way Home or not. Finally, we play a few games with the legend, set the record straight on some internet facts, and take him through an acting exercise that fans won't want to miss.

Additionally, Microsoft announces its working with Ubisoft to bring more of the publisher’s games to Game Pass. That initiative kicks off with Assassin’s Creed Origins and For Honor: Marching Edition become available on Game Pass sometime within the next two months via the Ubisoft Connect App. Ubisoft games are no stranger to Game Pass. Rainbow Six Extraction hit the library at launch in January, and Rainbow Six Siege and the base version of For Honor have been available through the service as well. But with the long-running rumor that Ubisoft's Uplay will be rolled into a Game Pass subscription a la EA Play, this move could be the first step towards that reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skydance New Media, the studio helmed by famed writer Amy Hennig, has announced it partnered with Lucasfilm Games to develop a new Star Wars title.
The upcoming game is described in a press release as a “richly cinematic action-adventure game” that will feature an original story. That’s about all there is in terms of details, as the project appears very early in development. 
“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig in the press release. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”
Hennig, best known as the chief creative mind behind the Uncharted series, is no stranger to working on the Star Wars license. Her last foray into the universe was EA’s ill-fated Project Ragtag, the canceled Star Wars title by the now-defunct Visceral Games.  
This marks the second major project for Skydance New Media, which was formed in 2019. Last October, Hennig announced her team was developing an original story-focused action-adventure Marvel game as its first title. We still don’t know anything about that game either, but having now two major Disney properties under its belt are big gets for the young studio. 
Now that the Star Wars license is no longer exclusive to EA, this new project joins the pile of several upcoming games from a variety of studios. Quantic Dreams’ Star Wars Eclipse was announced last December, and Ubisoft’s mysterious open-world game hasn't made a peep since its announcement last year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It gets easier every day to find out which games will simply run on a Steam Deck; the list of Steam Verified-rated games is regularly extending, and SteamDB are keeping track of Playable and Unsupported games as well. Still, while these may be old favourites that you’ve already sunk hours into on a desktop, you might still be wondering how these games play when transplanted to the smaller screen and gamepad-ish controls of a handheld. 


Liam was wondering it, anyway. Thus, he picked ten difference game genres from the most-played on Steam, asked me to play at least one game that would broadly represent each, and report back on which are the most (and least) suited to life on the Steam Deck.

        <id>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdate-review</id>
        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdate-review"/>
        <updated>2022-04-18T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Panic's Playdate doesn't have a lot to do with PC. It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.
It's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for.

Instead, Waffle presents you with a grid of five intersecting words with all of the letters already present. Most of the letters are jumbled up, and it's up to you to identify the correct words and spell them out by swapping the letters with each other using as few moves as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's strange now to think that, until May 2020, there were no Dread X games. Indie publishers DreadXP have become so synonymous with tightly curated, intriguing horror experiences that it's hard to believe the original demo anthology that kickstarted that reputation is only approaching its second anniversary.
Regular RPS readers may already be aware that (a) I'm a huge horror nerd, and (b) I think the games published under the DreadXP banner are something pretty special. I was equal parts grossed out and charmed by the Lovecraftian dating sim Sucker For Love: First Date when I reviewed it back in January, and was pleasantly surprised by my time with the My Friendly Neighborhood demo at the recent Steam Next Fest. So when I was offered the opportunity to interview Ted Hentschke, Head of Productions at DreadXP, as part of a digital event at last month's GDC, you can hardly blame me for jumping at the chance.

You might think that simply murdering customers who annoyed you would make it a lot easier, but Bone's Cafe has taught me that if anything, killing and cooking people just causes more problems.


Fun problems, though.

I'm here driving the RPS bus alone, nobody to stop me as I careen down the motorway screaming and trying to slam on the brakes. But I can't, because a golf ball has rolled under the pedal!
You ride this bus long enough, you see games move in cycles similar to fashion designers, or those big ferris wheels at fairgrounds. Things come round, they peak, they go round again. Often a few different people independently notice an empty niche and start working on something to fill it, so you get a bunch of games with similar themes or styles coming out within months of each other. So I ask: why and/or how have a bunch of people identified golf as a gap in the market?

After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, you! Want an absolutely massive SSD? For, you know, keeping all your games installed at once? Or downloading the entire internet, four terabytes at a time? Well, the Crucial MX500, an SSD which received the RPS seal of approval, has reached a new low price on Amazon UK. Having previously retailed for around £310 to £340, it's now been reduced to £284.50, a healthy 10% reduction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is the company's best gaming CPU*, and today it's going cheap at CCL in the UK. They're asking £345 for the 12-core, 24-thread processor when you use code SAVE20 at the checkout, and tossing in three months of Game Pass Ultimate and free next-day shipping to boot. That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with PC hardware orthodoxy supporting SSD replacement, I’m convinced that getting one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck is the wiser method of expanding its storage. It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

That's still about £70 to £100 over the base RRP, but it's a big improvement over the situation for the past year where we often saw these cards retailing - and selling - for over £500, £600 and even £700.
