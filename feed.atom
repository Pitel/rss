Unlike other peer-to-peer technologies such as Tor and BitTorrent, I2P has mostly stayed under the radar among the public at large. Considering its name that's perhaps fitting; however, its two-decade anniversary shouldn't go unnoticed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And what does it even MEAN to beat a game, man?
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild turned five years old this week, and to celebrate the momentous occasion the Twitter account for How Long To Beat — a site that tells you how long on average a game will take you to complete — reminded everyone of BOTW's stats:
Now, 50 hours sounds about right to me. I highly doubt that there are that many players who blasted through the whole thing and ran straight to the final Ganon battle, although you totally can do that from the beginning (it'll take you about half an hour if you speedrun it and, you know, you're really good) — so this average time spans between those who are supremely confident, those who spent hours wandering around, and those who, like me, just took things at their own pace.

The PlayStation Vita turned 10 years old last December, and while Sony is mostly done with the system, its legacy lives on.
It stretches a bit further than you might expect as well - with the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita homebrew scenes making a new breakthrough (credit - xerpi) that allows PlayStation Vita and its executables to run natively on the Nintendo Switch.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. This week we're bidding farewell to Nathan Drake by discussing his final adventure in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.
Released on May 10, 2016, Uncharted 4 was a shake-up for the series in more ways than one. Amy Henning, the franchises' primary creative mind, departed Naughty Dog during the game's development, leaving The Last of Us masterminds Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley to revamp the game's production. Uncharted 4 introduced players to Nate's long-lost brother Sam Drake (who was originally conceived as a more villainous figure) as well as new mechanics such as a grapple hook and even dialogue choices. How did Naughty Dog tie a bow on this beloved franchise? Tune in to find out. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Features Editor Kim Wallace (@kstar1785) as we unpack the history, narrative, and impact of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Switch is officially five-years-old now, and it's got us thinking back half a decade to our very first interactions with the little console that could. Whether we were lucky enough to get our hands on an early review unit, or marched down to our local video game emporium to pick up a pre-order, or winged it on the off-chance we'd find one on a department store shelf, there's nothing quite like the thrill of new hardware, is there?
However, five years is a long time for a console, and the OG Switch has seen two (well, two-and-a-half) new hardware versions hit the shelves since launch. The premium version is now the Switch OLED Model, and Switch Lite offers ever-more-portable gaming for people who don't like playing on the telly.

Well, it seems that last week was the calm before the storm, right? It's been a hectic few days in the land of Nintendo Life; chiefly, there was the big announcement of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet during the Pokemon Presents showcase. We also saw the release of Square Enix's Triangle Strategy and thought it was a darn good SRPG, and we provided our initial thoughts on the upcoming Kirby and the Forgotten Land, which you can also download a demo for right now! In other news, Cool Sh#t Magazine is doing what Nintendon't with an unofficial F-Zero Championship, and Ace Attorney is getting a fancy 20th Anniversary Orchestral Concert.
Now it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Members of the Final Fantasy XIV held a live Letter From the Producer presentation this morning, where Producer Naoki Yoshida (AKA Yoshi-P) gave some insight into what players will find in the first big patch for the Endwalker expansion.
Titled Newfound Adventure, Patch 6.1 will introduce just that: a new adventure to embark on. Or, at least, the beginnings of one. Rolling credits on Endwalker's main scenario closed the book on many ongoing storylines, including the overarching narrative of the Ascians, Primals, the Garlean Empire as we know it, and even more threads.

There was a time when video games were largely linear affairs. You either moved up and down or from left to right in enclosed spaces. As technology evolved, so did the scope of digital worlds. Now players are regularly treated to expansive environments filled with quests, interesting characters, and horizons that stretch further with every console generation.

Yep, this completely passed us by as well. Chex Quest was a 1996 non-violent shooter that launched on PCs in North America-only. It's a conversion of The Ultimate Doom, an updated version of the hugely influential Doom, and is famous for being the first-ever video game you could get in a cereal box. Ah, the '90s. You can't really promote a box of cereal if you're being violent, can you?

But when she said she wanted me to do the first one, and that the first GOTY awarded on RPS was 2007's Portal, I almost laughed. Does Portal hold up? Why even bother asking? Shut this whole article down. Of course it holds up. It's Portal.
Of course, conventional bait-and-switch writing would dictate that this is the point where I tell you that, aha, after playing Portal again in the blinding light of 2022 it's actually a heap of rubbish, such as could only otherwise be found on the streets on day ten of a two week bin-lorry strike. But obviously that is not the case, because we're talking about Portal. If anything it's even better than I remember. Like. It's fuckin' Portal.

Gran Turismo 7 is out today and the always-online game’s microtransactions are too. While you’re not required by any means to purchase in-game credits with real money to buy cars in the game, it seems doing so will cost more than it has in previous iterations. 
Video Games Chronicle first reported today that cars that cost roughly $5 in Gran Turismo Sport, the last GT release before today’s, can cost up to eight times more in GT7. That’s obviously not a great look for the newly-released “real driving simulator.” As noted by VGC, microtransactions were not accessible during the review period of t…]]></summary>

Blimps is an odd game. At a glance, it looks like an Elite-esque trading game, but it's more like... well. It's more like a game from the time before genres. A confusing, poorly explained time that mostly produced rubbish but occasionally produced a strange little gem like this.

But Thailand clearly puts out good video game adverts. One of note features Elden Ring, a family, a strange trumpet noise, and a story as complex and obtuse as FromSoft's offerings. Give it a watch below, you won't be disappointed. More confused and emotional, perhaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Elden Ring was first thrust out into the world back in 2019, I have to admit I was pretty nonplussed about it. I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.

Publisher:

Developer:
      Forever Entertainment
      
Release:
                      	April 7, 2022
			
            
The House of the Dead: Remake was announced last Spring and set to hit Switch sometime in 2021. That obviously didn’t happen and it’s been a minute since we’ve seen or heard anything about the game...until today, because Forever Entertainment has released a new trailer that reveals the remake’s release date. 
Fortunately, those anxious to play this classic won’t have to wait long because the trailer reveals The House of the Dead: Remake will hit Switch on April 7. The new trailer, which showcases some of the classic 1997 arcade gameplay and enemies we’ll be facing, hopefully tides you over until then.

“The House of the Dead: Remake is a remade version of the game introduced in 1997 in arcade platform,” Forever Entertainment’s website for the remake reads. “A classic arcade rail-shooter receives a whole new entourage and gameplay changes to suit modern gaming standards.” 
Here are some of the features you can expect in the game when it hits Switch next month:
Hordes of the undead monstrosities in a fast-paced rail-shooter
True to the original gameplay
Well known arcade classic with modern graphics and controls
Multiple endings
If you need more of the undead now, read about how Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 are getting new-gen updates on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S this year and then check out Game Informer's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City interview after that.

The ever-enduring popularity of Neptunia and Senran Kagura remains strong. And, if you put the two together, the results are eclectic and exciting if we go by Idea Factory International's new trailer for Neptunia X Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars.
The trailer gives us a little taste of what to expect from this hack-and-slash crossover on Switch, which sees the two popular series team up to fight huge enemies. There are some powerful attacks and bursts that the characters can pull off, and you'll be able to play minigames with them to strengthen your bonds and make them more powerful, no doubt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

Chinese firm Anbernic has produced a long line of wallet-friendly handheld emulation consoles over the years, with the RG351 being perhaps the most popular; its relatively powerful internals and appealing design have made it a hit with retro fans – not to mention bedroom coders, who have tinkered with the firmware to create custom software that gets even more performance out of the hardware.
Anbernic isn't alone in this field, and there are several competing firms who are hoping to steal away some of that market share. That's why Anbernic's next system, the RG552, is so important; the arrival of capable rivals means that the company needs to impress and that motivation has resulted in a device that has many ties with past glories – but also has a few startling new features to offer.

But the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh.

If there's no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you've either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are "cringe". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe. Here are nine minor NPCs who became major players.

Can’t get enough of Genshin Impact’s open world? Have you tried fishing yet? Anyway, when you’re done working on your in-game house and exploring the huge universe, you can soon augment your play sessions with a new line of Genshin Impact Funko Pops!
The new line comes in three different varieties, including Paimon. That’s right. Emergency food, the Funko Pop. While many players found Paimon exceedingly annoying when the game launched, she’s become a bit more of an endearing character as the game has gone on. Take a look at all that’s on offer below with the new Genshin Impact Funko Pop line.

While we don’t have an exact date for these new arrivals, they’ll make an interesting addition to any Genshin Impact treasure trove.]]></summary>

Many herald The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as the greatest video game of all time. Whether you were 13 years old or going on 30, the title changed video game design forever. With its vast world, puzzle-laden dungeons, and innovative Z-Targeting lock-on system, the project led to the emergence of the 3D action-adventure genre. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess followed suit, further validating the success of Ocarina's revolutionary format. However, while Ocarina of Time was a defining experience during my childhood, I never considered myself a fan of the ser…]]></summary>

When The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild released alongside the Nintendo Switch in 2017, I was apprehensive to say the least. I enjoyed what I played at E3 2016, and adored the art style, but the myriad ways in which the game took my favorite series and turned it on its head had me worried I'd be left with a shadow of what made me fall in love with it in the first place. Once I finally got the finished game in my hands, it clicked almost immediately for me, and all my fears fell by the wayside.

Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list.

It's hard to imagine Nintendo released its most recent console, Switch, five years ago today. With it started the handheld hybrid revolution ushered in by one of the greatest games of all time The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and later in the year, Super Mario Odyssey. It's been a hell of a ride so far, and in the half-decade since its release, the Nintendo Switch has gone toe-to-toe with not one, but now two generations of powerhouse consoles from rival brands Xbox and PlayStation, and continues to sell well despite being undeniably a less graphically powerful device.
The Switch has been home to tons of great gaming experiences since becoming available on March 3, 2017. I'd like to know two things from you, dear readers: what is your favorite game …]]></summary>

Since the release of Battlefield 2042 last November, DICE and EA have been in an uphill battle when it comes to making fans of the series happy. The game launched with bugs – read about how that affects the overall experience in Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review – and since then, players have asked for changes to the scoreboard, map, overall performance, and more. In fact, some players have created a petition for a Battlefield 2042 refund that’s been signed by over 70,000 people. 
DICE has been open in its discussion with players on how to fix the game and now, it’s released a lengthy blo…]]></summary>

As two of my friends joined me in using gestures for the co-op screenshot pictured above, one of my friends warned that a large guy on a horse was heading toward us. Ten seconds later, my two friends and I were shrieking louder than we ever have in each other’s headsets. It turns out that “large guy on a horse” was a Tree Sentinel, a boss we had no chance of defeating after just a few hours of exploring The Lands Between.

Season 6 of Sea of Thieves is set to begin on March 10 and Rare Games has released a preview trailer of the new content awaiting pirates in it. 
The big new feature of Season 6 is the inclusion of six Sea Forts on the Sea of Thieves. Described by the team as a new “mini-raid” experience, these Sea Forts can be attacked and plundered at any time by yourself or a full crew. Regardless of who’s sailing with you, Rare says the Sea Forts can be completed, so if you’re a solo player, there’s no need to worry that you won’t be able to loot everything within a Sea Forts’ walls.

As you can see in the trailer above, the forts look much more formidable than the already-existing forts on the Sea of Thieves. Forts are meant to bring players together, whereas Rare says Sea Forts are meant to provide a personalized challenge to players. 
Another new feature in Season 6 is the addition of more Pirate Legend Voyages. These are replayable legends that will task you with uncovering treasure by way of new maps, plundering ship graveyards, and more. On top of all this, Rare has released a 2022 timeline that details what to expect in not just Season 6, but Season 7, 8, and 9, which will take players through all of 2022. 
For more about Sea of Thieves, read about Shrouded Islands, the game’s first adventure released last month, and then check out this story about how Sea of Thieves’ PvP arena is set to shut down this month.

Update, 3/3/22:
Just two weeks after the release of Season 1 on Netflix, The Cuphead Show has been renewed for a second season. The official Netflix Geeked account announced the renewal, with a new image (presumably from Season 2). What's more, is that it will hit Netflix this Summer. As for what to expect, that's anybody's guess but it will likely continue the ongoing narrative that began in Season 1.

After several years of waiting and a few demos and beta tests, Babylon’s Fall launches today. While pre-release reception has been mixed, we’re taking the game through its paces on Twitch this afternoon at 2 p.m. Central to see how the final product stacks up. 
Babylon’s Fall puts you and your friends in the role of Sentinals, warriors armed with up to four weapons to ascend a massive tower called the Ziggurat in an effort to cure a deadly disease. Each floor of this towering structure overflows with deadly enemies and other hazards, making it an uphill battle in every sense of the term.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Dan Tack, as I show off the combat, progression, and painterly world of Babylon’s Fall. We’ll face off against fearsome knights, strange goblin-esque critters, and maybe even an oversized boss. Regardless of what we encounter, it’ll be a blast to have you, our lovely readers, along for the ride with the rest of the GI community in our Twitch chat.

Housemarque is a modern-day arcade powerhouse. Games like Resogun and Nex Machina were homages to zany, psychedelic shoot 'em ups. Returnal, in its own impressive way, builds upon the developer's lineage by offering similar visuals and mechanics wrapped in a 3D, Triple-A skin. Despite the massive success of the sci-fi roguelike – Housemarque was acquired by Sony, after all – the studio is smartly broadening its horizons again. Housemarque is developing a new game, but it won't be Returnal 2. 
In an award show interview with Venturebeat and an array of other outlets, narrative director Gregory Louden, game director Henry Krueger, and managing director Ilari Kuittinen were asked about the future of Housemarque (among other topics), "...In a time where games are changing, the people playing them are changing, how do you hold on to [your] identity?"
Recently, Sony's pivoted towards a live service methodology, a multiplayer-centric style that Housemarque likely won't employ. That's because the team's already tried it, to middling results:
"We had our stint working on multiplayer games, because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience. We tried that, and we really didn't do it as well. But it's early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We'll see what comes with that."
What exactly this new IP is remains to be seen, but Kuittinen also briefly mentioned that Nex Machina, "a shoot-'em-up game in the style of the coin-ops from the 80s," might be a clue. It's safe to assume that Housemarque might be working on another large-scope game like Returnal, and it'll be interesting to see how the developer finds ways to mix its arcade roots with a modern, new-gen veneer. 
For more on Returnal, read our review.

Basically we're talking about when you do normal work in games that isn't hero-slaying-monster type stuff, you know?
A really bumper number of digressions this week, though. The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast. Plus, Nate has a Cavern Of Lies this week which is themed about, er, Nate.

GSC Game World, which voiced its support for its home country of Ukraine last week, has put the development of its upcoming shooter, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl, on the “sidelines” amidst the ongoing conflict happening in Ukraine. 
After weeks of mounting tensions, Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. GSC Game World, 11 Bit Studios, Bungie, and many other studios have voiced their support for Ukraine. GSC Game World, based in Ukraine, revealed in a new video that Stalker 2 was sidelined to focus on employee safety and support.

Here’s everything said in the video: 
It’s unclear if this means Stalker 2, which was delayed to December earlier this year, will be released even later. Although, to be honest, a video game delay does not matter in the slightest with everything happening in  Ukraine. Here’s hoping everyone at GSC Game World remains safe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. 
A long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.”

Triangle Strategy, a new tactical RPG led by Tomoya Asano, producer of the Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler games, makes its debut tomorrow. I’ve been playing through the political adventure, which centers on a young ruler named Serenoa who is thrust into intense power struggles and must decide what’s best for a new generation.
So far, I’m really digging Triangle Strategy, especially the interesting questions it poses about political strategies and how it involves the player in deciding those answers for themselves. Unfortunately, I haven’t finished the game, which has branching paths and multiple endings, so I’m not quite ready…]]></summary>

Kirby returns to the Nintendo Switch later this month in the new 3D platforming adventure, Kirby and the Forgotten Land. In it, Kirby is transported to another world, far from his home on Popstar, to a location that looks a lot like Earth, at least in the early levels. There in the titular Forgotten Land, Kirby will have to use all of his valuable Copy Abilities and a few new tricks like the very meme-able Mouthful Mode to explore and survive this unfamiliar setting. This week, I was able to go hands-on with the first world of the game, similar to what Switch owners can play today in a new demo t…]]></summary>

Big players in the video game world are responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and are removing the sport teams of the aggressor nations from its games. The move is an act of solidarity with other organizations aiming to denounce the recent military action. Specifically, in a pair of tweets, EA has announced it will remove Russian and Belarusian teams from the most recent versions of its popular sports franchises, FIFA and NHL 22.
A statement from EA SPORTS FIFA: pic.twitter.com/v3pZvpblgS
March 2, 2022
Following in the footsteps of real-world sports organizations FIFA, UEFA, and IIHF in the suspension of Russian and Belarusian national teams and clubs, EA will remove these teams from their games as well in the coming days and weeks. "In line with our partners at FIFA and UEFA," says the Twitter announcement, "EA Sports has initiated processes to remove the Russian national team and all Russian clubs from EA Sports FIFA products including: FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile, and FIFA Online. We're also actively evaluating related changes to other areas of our games." The same goes for the hockey franchise NHL 22 which will be trimmed of its teams representing both Russia and Belarus.

"EA Sports stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and like so many voices across the world of football, calls for peace and an end to the invasion of Ukraine," reads the FIFA account's announcement with a similar sentiment shared from the EA Sports NHL account. The removal of teams is set to start in the coming weeks. EA has stated that it will provide additional updates on the matter as they become available.]]></summary>

Summoned spirits in Elden Ring can be handy tools to help take on challenging bosses and swarms of foes. Over the course of the game, you unlock all kinds of companions that you can upgrade, selecting various creatures and characters for the right situation. While there is a vast array of both standard critters and named allies that you can call upon for help, one summon stands high above the rest, though it has a steep cost of health to call into battle. We’re going to tell you how to unlock the Mimic Tear summon ahead but be warned, there are plenty of spoilers along the way. If you’re …]]></summary>

Over the years, what defines a game as the “action” category has gotten more ambiguous than ever, as many games now include aspects of multiple core genres. However, one thing remains certain – games in this category give the player a polished, exciting experience. So, what is this list all about? This isn’t a Top 10 Action Games of All Time list or a Top 10 Action Games of a Generation list. Instead, we’re tackling this one from the angle of what’s important, what’s incredible, and what’…]]></summary>

Rennala Queen of the Full Moon is the demigod, or rather has one in her possession, who resides in the Raya Lucaria Academy legacy dungeon. The motherly sorceress is in the Grand Library, surrounded by her orphaned disciples, and casts powerful magic attacks. Unlike Margit or Godrick, this is a relatively easy fight – especially for melee-focused users. In this Elden Ring boss guide, I’ll show you how to beat Rennala Queen of the Full Moon.

With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's reveal this past weekend, hindsight is very much on the side of Pokémon fans who have combed through recent games to find hints at what the future holds for the Pokémon series. A Reddit user may have found Gen 9 Easter eggs in not one but two recent Pokémon titles. 
In a Reddit post, a user named DDD-HERO points out a clever hint hidden within a hotel in Pokémon Sword and Shield:
The image above, taken by DDD-HERO, shows said wallpaper adorned with grapes and oranges. Those two fruits can be found all over in the Scarlet and Violet reveal trailer, including two plaques flanking a doorway, each featuring an icon representing either an orange or a bushel of grapes.
It's a great find from this web sleuth, who also came up with another possible hint in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Seen below, there's a flowerbed in Twinleaf town filled with red and purple flowers, now recognized as the color pair for Scarlet and Violet. DDD-HERO made sure to check the original versions of Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, finding that the fenced garden initially existed but with less-pronounced flowers of different colors. I'd say this is another hit of a hint!
Now to find one in Pokémon Legends: Arceus...
Check out the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right here, and find out which Pokémon are confirmed for the new duo of Switch titles so far.]]></summary>

Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the legendary, long-running PlayStation racing franchise, is out on Friday. I'm currently speeding through the content, but I was slow off the line, so I'm not quite ready to render my final verdict. However, from what I've played, Gran Turismo 7 is everything players should want from a simulation racer. 
My first impression was just how flat-out gorgeous this game is. Yes, racing games typically are visual showcases, but Gran Turismo 7 is impressive even in a genre that includes the likes of Forza Horizon 5. Each vehicle, track, and environment is meticulously modeled, giving you a true sense of immersion as you drive at blistering speeds. Around every turn, the beauty of Polyphony Digital's work is unavoidable.
Unlike Forza Horizon 5, Gran Turismo 7 is a sim racer that takes place on closed tracks. That means you won't be exploring a vast, open world or launching yourself off ramps, but there is plenty of fun to be had. Whether you're competing in white-knuckled races over the course of several laps, completing activities to satisfy special missions, or racking up mileage in special time trials set to musical playlists, Gran Turismo 7 offers a diverse set of content. Not only that, but it appeals heavily to the collector in me, continually encouraging me to build as robust a garage of vehicles as I can.
Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec captivated me more than two decades ago and was perhaps the most-played game on my PlayStation 2. The series hasn't held my attention to that extent in the time since, but even in my early stages, I can feel Gran Turismo 7 begin to sink its hooks in me. Only time will tell if this game will steal hours upon hours from me the way Gran Turismo 3 did, but so far, I'm having a great time with the latest from Polyphony Digital.]]></summary>

Have you survived the zombie hordes and now you’re looking for some new challenges? The upcoming Back 4 Blood expansion, Tunnels of Terror, comes with some fearsome fare that even the most seasoned survivors will have to adapt to. In a tweet today, Back 4 Blood laid out a bit of the new content scheduled to arrive on April 12.
Tunnels of Terror will be coming to Fort Hope on April 12th, 2022. Here's a little sneak peek on what to look forward to! pic.twitter.com/AOrigv2UuK
March 1, 2022
The update includes two new cleaners, Sharice and Heng, and three kinds of warped ridden to face-off against. Yes, that’s a fire axe that Sharice is wielding, so the undead are in serious trouble. The potentially much bigger news is that a new PvE experience is also coming with this update, the ridden hives. Of course, there are all kinds of new loot to be had as well, so that should have cleaners crawling back to camp to take on these new threats. Warped chests, new cards, and legendary weapons are all on deck to help fight back against the undead tide.
The Tunnels of Terror is scheduled to land on April 12 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you planning to head into the tunnels?

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.
There's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing "hahaha" of old. And it makes me sad.

Capcom announced that the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes along with Resident Evil 7 Biohazard are making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S this year. 
The move to more powerful hardware means these titles will boast new enhancements such as ray tracing, 3D audio, and, according to a press release, “high frame rate”. Capcom doesn’t specify what that means but one would assume the games will hit at least 60 fps since that’s the benchmark for current-gen titles. The PS5 versions feature Dual Sense haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support as well. 
Best of all, if you already own these games on last-gen consoles you’ll get a free upgrade to the new versions (with Smart Delivery on Xbox). A free upgrade patch is also coming to the PC versions. There’s no release date for these re-releases but expect them in 2022. 
Resident Evil 7 Biohazard launched in 2017 and was hailed as a return to form for the series, shifting the perspective to first-person and getting back to the franchise’s survival horror roots. Its direct sequel, Resident Evil Village, arrived in 2021. The remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 were similarly celebrated as smart reimaginings of the PS1 classics, reinventing them using Resident Evil 4’s over-the-shoulder gameplay.

It's a "playable short" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.
In fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After purchasing the anime streaming service, Crunchyroll, last year, Sony Pictures Entertainment is shifting its other anime-focused service, Funimation, and all of its content under the Crunchyroll banner.
Effective immediately, Crunchyroll is now the home to an even more massive library of anime titles including many English dubs that previously were produced by and presented by Funimation. A full list can be found on the Crunchyroll site, but here are some of the shows now available for Crunchyroll viewers:
Attack on Titan: Junior High (Sub and Dub)
Black Clover ep. 1–170 (Dub)
Cowboy Bebop (Sub and Dub)
Darling in the Franxx (Dub)
Dr. Stone seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)
Fire Force seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)
Fruits Basket seasons 1-3 (Dub)
Hunter x Hunter ep. 1–74 (Dub)
My Hero Academia seasons 1–5 (Dub)
Scarlet Nexus (Dub)
Sk8 the Infinity (Sub and Dub)
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime seasons 1 and 2 and OADs (Dub)
Tokyo Ghoul (Dub)
Yu Yu Hakusho ep. 1-112 and OVAs (Sub and Dub)
Yuri!!! on Ice (Dub)
Starting with the upcoming spring season for anime, Crunchyroll will be the place to catch subs and dubs of any new anime for both Sony-owned streamers. Funimation users will only be able to watch new episodes of series already existing on the Funimation service, so now is definitely the time to migrate over to Crunchyroll. To encourage the switch and ease the transition, Funimation subscribers will be receiving an email with an offer for 60 days of a premium Crunchyroll subscription for free. 
Crunchyroll recently became one of four streaming apps available on the Nintendo Switch, and with this consolidation, renders Funimation's Switch app obsolete, bringing the count ostensibly back down to three.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[February was a bumper month for PC games, wasn’t it? As if Elden Ring wasn't enough game to be getting on with, we also had strategy behemoth Total War: Warhammer 3 alongside surprise hit Lost Ark. You could argue that after a month as busy as February, we could all do with a bit of space to actually play these enormous games before we throw anything else onto our already bursting backlogs.
Sadly, I come bearing terrible news. March is yet another jam-packed month for new releases, with huge titles such as GhostWire: Tokyo and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands threatening to tear our attention away from the wonderful Elden Ring. And that’s before I tell you about promising indie releases like Tunic and Weird West!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you missed out on watching the Marvel Defenders series like Daredevil and Jessica Jones while they were on Netflix, as of yesterday those shows are no longer available. The good news is Disney is making room on its streaming service for all of the MCU-related TV shows.
The countdown is on. Marvel's Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, The Punisher, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. start streaming March 16 on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/U80cfZCPa8
March 1, 2022
Starting on March 16, Disney+ will be the exclusive place to watch every season of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Punisher, The Defenders, and even former ABC series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which was conspicuously missing from the Marvel lineup. Those shows will join the already accessible Agent Carter on Disney+ that weren't natively made for the service, nor strictly tied to the current Marvel Cinematic Universe storylines. However, the Netflix roster, which has always been part of the MCU canon, has only recently started to be more directly referenced in the newer movies/Disney+ shows so bringing them home makes more sense than ever. 
Disney and Marvel haven't said whether the series migrating to Disney+ will receive any additional seasons, specials, or even films, but with all of these shows hitting the mothership streaming service certainly leaves some doors open. As for the saucier nature of the former Netflix series (these aren't fun family-friendly romps), United States subscribers to Disney+ will see some "updated parental controls" landing alongside the shows. Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand will also have access to these shows on March 16.]]></summary>

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K has spent the last few weeks rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
2K has finally unveiled the full, complete roster (excluding DLC characters, of which Machine Gun Kelly was recently announced). WWE fans will be most surprised …]]></summary>

March Madness is in the air! No, not college basketball; we mean the madness of your backlog expanding due to new Xbox Game Pass titles, obviously.
Far: Changing Tides launches today on the service. The sea-faring sequel to Far: Lone Sails offers another enjoyable and meditative sidescrolling puzzle romp.

Demon’s Souls started it all. Sure, folks will argue that the concepts that would go on to become the modern-day Soulslike started even earlier in From Software’s history with games like Shadow Tower or the King’s Field games. But the modern incarnations feature challenging action/RPGs that offer battles with larger-than-life bosses, risk/reward offerings, mysteries to explore, and tight combat mechanics that force the player to commit to their choices. 
For the purposes of this list, I’m acknowledging that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has plenty of Soulslike framework, but d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent update to the Nintendo Switch has brought a new feature called Missions and Rewards. While not quite achievements, these little tasks encourage Switch owners to use and explore the Switch Online service.
With the update now available, anyone subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online has access to Missions and Rewards. This feature adds tasks that, when completed, will shell out a handful of My Nintendo Platinum Points upon completion. Missions to complete include backing up a save to the cloud or booting up Super Mario Bros. in the Switch Online NES collection or other ways to make sure you're exploring everything you can do with your online subscription. To view these missions, simply head to the Nintendo Switch Online app on the Switch's home screen.
Since the rewards available use the already existing Platinum Points, you may already have a pile of coins stashed away to redeem on a host of new digital items like new icon elements. These elements are character photos, frames, and backgrounds used to build and customize an icon image for your Switch profile. Right now, Switch Online users can pay Platinum Points for Animal Crossing and Mario Odyssey-themed icon parts, with a fresh set of icon elements becoming available each month. Or you can just save up the Platinum Points for the physical and digital prizes already offered in the My Nintendo program. 
For other recent additions and announcements for Nintendo Switch Online, check out the new additions of Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings to the service, and the reveal of new tracks coming to Mario Kart 8 in the very near future.]]></summary>

That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.


Valve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.

Young Souls was a rare Stadia timed-exclusive that launched last August and impressed us with its entertaining blend of beat-em-up combat and run-based dungeon crawling. Curious players on other platforms had to endure a lengthy delay to try the game themselves, but Young Souls finally has a console and PC release date, and it's just over a week from now. 
On March 10, you can play Young Souls on PlayStation 4, Xbox One (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC. The game stars two orphaned twins living in a small town that must rescue their adoptive father after an underground goblin kingdom kidnaps him. Either alone or with one other player, you'll brawl your way through dungeons using your fists or outfitted with a variety of weapons and armor. Playing alone manages to be just as enjoyable thanks to a smart tag-team mechanic that lets you instantly swap between each sibling to chain combos and preserve health. The new trailer below provides a full breakdown of the game's features.

I scored Young Souls an 8.5 out of 10, describing it as "an exceptional adventure you shouldn't miss if you're searching for the next great game to tackle with a friend or want a quality RPG brawler to dig into alone." You can read my full review here.]]></summary>

You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.
Vix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.

For any enthusiasts following Elden Ring’s entire development process, it can still be pretty easy to forget that George R.R. Martin lent his talent to the game’s central plot. From Software’s titles are synonymous with emergent storytelling – predominantly found in gameplay interactions – and periphery beats discovered within the flavor text of equippable gear and other items. Martin’s inclusion might not have changed that age-old formula, but it’s hard not to see Elden Ring’s Western fantasy influences (e.g., Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones) in the art design and overarching narra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. I'm sorry this month's Letter From The Editor is a bit late. February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  
Of course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.

I haven't played nearly as much Elden Ring as Ed or our guides team, but I do feel this statement, while not an exact a lie, definitely needs a lot more qualification than people are giving it. 
In relative terms, one would say that a bowl of hot sick was more enjoyable than eating a bowl of cold sick, for example. Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, "You should do this thing." In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always had a soft spot for Borderlands' looting and shooting, so anything new on its fantasy successor Tiny Tina's Wonderlands has me very curious. And judging by a fresh 20 minute gameplay walkthrough that shows off two new Fatebringers, locales, and questline, I'm thinking I'll rather enjoy its mixture of FPS silliness and tabletop antics, even if it doesn't look like a massive departure from Borderlands. You can check out the new gameplay footage below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few minutes out of Elex 2’s, pleasantly brief, tutorial area I came across a radio. The broadcast was announcing a concert at the nearby amphitheatre. A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.


There is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.

When you look into the bucket, you find sand, paint, bread, pottery, chocolate, nails, and several crabs all speaking different languages. Isn't this fascinating? What the hell is going on? This is Hero's Hour, an untidy RTS sand bucket filled with so many ideas it's hard to see how this turbulent mix will have any structural integrity at all when you finally up-end the bucket to build a tower. And yet… it sorta does? I don't know. I'm lost. How do I get off this beach?

A man who invents successive tales of fantasy in an effort to stay his likely execution by an impatient general interrogating him in a dark room. Ivan is the little guy in every sense, small in stature, a hunching underdog to forces beyond his control. As the likeable hero of Little Orpheus, a vibrant modernising of the cinematic platformer, he builds a rapport with the general that carries the game as best it can through eight beautiful but ultimately formulaic levels. This is a light game, unchallenging by design, and for me, sleepily so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Warrior 3 continues the series tradition of completely rebooting the style of each game. This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an owner of two cats who regularly bring home all manner of half-eaten wildlife from the neighbouring bins, hedgerows and overgrown student gardens, I often wonder how these adorable murderers are perceived by the local mice and rat population. If it's anything like ginger puss cat Tiger in Jeremy "Aviary Attorney" Noghani's turn-based RPG Small Saga, they're going to be in trouble, as these rodents come bearing switchblades and cigarette lighters to fend off their deadly foes. It's an intriguing take on the classic Final Fantasy-like job types of other RPGs - the switchblade is to protagonist Verm what Cloud's Buster Sword is to a regular human, while Siobhan's lighter allows her to cast fire 'magic' as the party's mage - and based on its hour-long Steam Next Fest demo, it's shaping up to be just as grand a tale as its lauded genre mates.

Drag your fella's facial features around to form expressions, and that emotion will be the foundation of his behaviour in conversation. It's an interesting challenge on a timer, and the intentional performance of emotion feels perfectly sinister when maybe we know a little too much about a missing person. Who's Lila? does have a demo, so you can pull some faces yourself.

The aim was to answer as many as possible in time for the system’s official launch, which is today! After scouring through your questions and posing them to hardware editor James - who's been putting the system through its paces for a week or so now - we've created a mammoth 19 minute long video that's bursting at the seams with new information about Valve's first handheld PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.
What, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.


While indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Praise and curse the Steam Deck, for it has stolen 20 years of my life. A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. 


Not that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.
Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.

Blood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.

It's called Onbu and it couldn't give a monkey's that you're on its back just trying to get by. At first, that is. Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.
I'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu. My enemy isn't some army a mile away, it's Onbu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harriers are rare among the bird family, in that they’re one of the very few birds to have been overtaken in popularity by their namesake fighter jet*. Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. 


So it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks.

A court in Germany has now prohibited ResearchGate from making those titles available but refused to award damages due to the plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate acquisition rights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instantly beautiful, fast and playable, Grid Legends provides the perfect counterpoint to serious sim racing. It is very clearly similar to 2019’s Grid reboot, although there is immediately one thing that’s changed that makes this offering worth the upgrade. No, not the added story mode, it’s more fundamental than that; it’s the handling. It just didn’t feel quite right in the last game, whereas here it’s arguably the most playable handling system of any modern racer that doesn’t have ‘Kart’ in its title. Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Elden Ring launching tonight (or already out in some places), Bandai Namco have released notes for the day-one patch. While this is probably more notable to console players buying the game on a 'disc' (some sort of tangible version of Spotify, I think?), perhaps you might be interested to see what's changed since the version of the game reviewers reviewed? You know, all those glowing, effusive reviews, who evidently weren't super-bothered by these issues. But it's good to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Influential first-person exploration game Dear Esther released commercially 10 years ago this month. But before it was on the front page of Steam and selling like hotcakes, it was a Half Life 2 mod cooked up by designer and writer Dan Pinchbeck and a group of friends. “I was doing a PhD, weirdly, on first person shooters,” Pinchbeck says. As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”

Contrary to what I say on the recording, this is in fact episode 175 of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. I probably got it wrong because I'd been up all night at the discotheque. Yes, this week we're taking a suggestion from the listeners and talking about our favourite nightclubs in games. And three more qualified people to talk about clubbing you would not meet.
But first this week there's some big Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill news to get out of the way, plus we discuss drinking animal blood in VIP sections (which is what rich people do), and at what point it stops being cool to go to a nightclub. For me? Almost immediately. And me and Matthew have actually been playing a game, but it's a PlayStation game so please don't listen to us talk about it. But you should definitely listen to Matthew's Hitman-themed Cavern Of Lies.

I'd like to wax lyrical about a good boss in Elden Ring, if you don't mind. He's a beastman, of sorts, who awaits you at the end of a castle. But more than that, he's an optional challenge that both leaves a lasting impression and doesn't at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the game where you peel a dead woman’s face off. You do it slowly, with a blunt dog tag, making several raggedy incisions before tearing off the face proper. After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. 


Apart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead. They suck. Horror games are allowed to be horrific, but the way to cultivate real fear is through restraint rather than desensitising bombardment. For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”.

"Nothing but grief here", you mark by Bloodborne. "Time for crab", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.
But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. "Visions of joy" sums it up nicely.
