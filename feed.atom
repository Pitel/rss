        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Disney Dreamlight Valley's Palace of Time and Jafar's Laboratory quests, you'll explore Jafar's castle to confront him and stop Eternity Isle's curse once and for all. However, to find the final key, you'll need to talk to a picky raven and cook some bird food using vegetables and fish.


How to make Bird Food during The Palace of Time


Unlike regular recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley, bird food requires a bit of puzzle-solving. Below is a quick list of ingredients you need:



Ripe Tomato


Ripe Carrot


Rotten Fish


Rotten Clam



You'll discover a hint to this recipe by reading the journal next to the ingredient table. Although it doesn't explicitly tell you all four items, it'll reveal that the raven loves rotten seafood and fresh vegetables.

However, when you first open the laboratory's ingredient table, you won't find the rotten fish immediately. Instead, you'll see four ripe items, two of which you need for the recipe. Pick up the ripe carrot and tomato before interacting with the nearby hourglass.


Once you interact with the hourglass, all four items will turn rotten. Although you don't need all four items, the rotten clam and fish are key components to this dish. It may be gross to us, but the raven loves it.

Now that you have the bird food, bring it to the raven to advance one step closer to completing Jafar's Laboratory quest. The raven will give you a power coil, which you'll use to power up the nearby pillar and unlock the door. Behind this door is the key you need for the Palace of Time quest, so make sure to pick it up before leaving.

What are Focus Points in Black Myth: Wukong?


Focus Points are a unique, combat-orientated resource that allows you to use powerful staff attacks to overwhelm your foes. Your most potent abilities, outside of spells, in Black Myth: Wukong will come from expending Focus Points, so it is imperative to understand how they work.


Focus Points are earned by dealing damage with staff attacks, charging up your Heavy Attack, and perfectly dodging enemy attacks. You can see the resource fill at the bottom-right portion of y…]]></summary>

How to get Yaogaui Cores in Black Myth: Wukong


You probably have some sitting in your inventory already, but to get more Yaogaui Cores, all you need to do is slay Yaogaui. Almost all of the enemies you face in Black Myth: Wukong are of Yaogaui origins, which means your natural progression throughout the game should yield you some. 


Yaogaui Cores are a rare resource drop, as indicated by their rarity appearance (Blue), which means you likely won't see one after every single kill. Lowly Yaogaui, like the zombies around Yellow Wind Ridge, have the lowest chance of giving you Yaogaui Cores because they are weak, though. The best way to obtain them en masse is to kill stronger, elite Yaogaui. Generally speaking, the stronger the Yaogaui you purge, the higher the chance it will drop a Yaogaui Core on death.


Yaoguai Cores can also be obtained randomly from looting chests, breaking vases, and bought from the Store for 900 Will. I really don't recommend wasting the Will on these, though, since they can fairly easily be farmed up with a little time and dedication. However, if you are desperate and in need of them immediately for that next big weapon upgrade, then this is certainly a viable option.


As I mentioned, Yaogaui Cores have a chance to drop from nearly all enemies in the game, so even if you don't take the time and farm them up, you will undoubtedly get them naturally over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley has hundreds of recipes you can make, from unsalted crackers to complex, multi-ingredient dishes. The classic frankfurter, more commonly known as a hotdog, is one of many recipes available in the Rift in Time expansion pack, but gaining its ingredients is partially luck-based.


Classic Frankfurter recipe


In Disney Dreamlight Valley, classic frankfurter is a four-star recipe requiring the following ingredients:



Venison


Poultry


Pork


Wheat



After completing the Centre of Attention quest, you'll unlock Gaston's meat stall in The Wastes, which you can use to buy every meat type. Once you have all four items, grab a piece of coal and head to any nearby campfire or the Chez Remy kitchen to cook the dish.


How to get Classic Frankfurter ingredients


Although the classic frankfurter's ingredients are simple to find once you're familiar with Gaston's meat stall, obtaining them is still random. Here's how to get all four items:



Venison: Purchase from Gaston's stall for 1,000 Star Coins


Poultry: Purchase from Gaston's stall for 250 Star Coins


Pork: Purchase from Gaston's stall for 500 Star Coins


Wheat: Purchase from Ancient's Landing or Peaceful Meadow Goofy Stalls



Gaston's meat stall refreshes daily, so there's a chance you won't find the first three items immediately. You may have to wait a day or two to buy everything, which can delay making the dish. They're also expensive, with all three costing 1,750 Star Coins. Fortunately, wheat is an early-game item you can get quickly from Goofy Stalls, making one of the four ingredients easy to obtain.

The closed and open betas for Concord gave players a chance to try out all initial 16 Freegunners and a decent slice of the overall game ahead of its launch, though much more is planned for post-launch in the game's roadmap.

Sevagoth Prime lives and dies off of the damage of his abilities, so we're going to make ample use of Ability Strength here. However, some duration and utility mods don't hurt. The following setup should do just that:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feverdream Johnny has announced that they’re once again partnering with Drury Lane to bring us more Orbo, star of Orbo’s Odyssey. Orbo’s Exodus will continue the series in 2025 by, like, once again featuring the character. Now with hats.


When we last left Orbo, he had quit his job. He’s now headed home by way of biplane, and crashes near a resort. He now has to find a way to buy a ferry to take him and Peebs (star of Peeb Adventure) back to the mainland.


This would be easier if you read my review of Orbo’s Odyssey, but I’ll try my best to describe this. You play as a little meeple man who can rocket into the air at high velocity. This ability enables collectathon platformer gameplay. It’s fun. The first game was advertised at around 1-2 hours, which was accurate. Orbo’s Exodus is looking at 4-6 hours. I mentioned of the first game that it felt somewhat inconsequential, and part of that was that it was so small that it could get caught in your teeth, and while a longer runtime doesn’t specifically address this, it can help.


Also, I mentioned hats. There are drill, propeller, and bowler hats. The drill unscrews screws and sends you into the dirt. The propellor allows you to “manipulate your environment and kill pesky opponents with a controllable laser turret,” which isn’t how I understand the functions of a propellor. The bowler hat enables you to “hop into the driver's seat of special machines and perform amateur surgery on your friends.” I love amateur surgery!


I said in my review of Orbo’s Odyssey that I’d be down for whatever Feverdream Softworks got up to next, and I stand by that. I’m excited to see how the concept has grown. I’m also curious to see what kind of existential dread bleeds into the experience.


Orbo’s Exodus is set to launch next year (2025) on PC.

There are five Golden Keys in Cat Quest 3. You'll know you're on the trail of a key when a golden coin suddenly avoids your greedy ambitions and floats off to parts unknown. Following it leads to a treasure box that rewards in gold coins and a single Golden Key that unlocks a floor in a fortress called the Golden Tower. You can make your way to the tower early, but it's best to gather all the available keys first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

In Hide and Seek, you can't just outrun your Seekers if you become a Hider. A special meter will be available at the bottom of your screen, and as the gauge fills up, you can camouflage yourself. As a result, you can even hide in the open and make a fool out of those pursuing you.




But beware: drive too close, and the hiders can ping your location. This will help them track you down before approaching the Endzone. From what I understood, the Endzone will be visible as a bright-orange location, but it will take time to activate. While hiding might be the right choice in certain situations, be ready to run when required.


Forza Horizon 5, released in 2021, continues to get more content in festivals and seasons. I am more than intrigued to try out Hide and Seek when it goes live on September 10, 2024. The mode will also have its own reward track, which will include XP from the games you play. Playing continuously will also help you to unlock a play streak and get bonus XP as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windup Games, a studio founded mainly by industry veterans and former staff from Coldwood Interactive (Unravel, Unravel Two), has revealed its debut game, Hela. It’s an open-world adventure involving mice; it’s coming to PC and consoles, and it’s the best thing I’ve seen this morning.


The trailer shows off two mice trying to figure out some sort of puzzle involving a hanging pair of eyeglasses while not waking a cat. They hold their breath as a rolling washer makes potentially cat-rousing levels of noise. When the cat doesn’t stir, balls of light waft in through the window. They get focused into one ball by the glasses, and then the mice stuff it into a jar. Take that, magic.




Then, it cuts to the good stuff: the gameplay. The mice swing around like Spider-man in a big yard using woolen tongues that shoot out from their frog-shaped backpacks. They then glide around by filling their backpacks with hot air or something. There’s foraging for mushrooms, giant bunnies, and some good-old cooperative gameplay.


It looks a bit rough in a low-budget Unreal Engine 5 kind of way, but the gameplay looks bewilderingly enjoyable. The press release describes it as “heartwarming,” but I think it looks rad. If you get to ride a paper boat down a stream, I’m going to lose my mind.


Hela doesn’t have a stated release date and is said to be coming to PC and consoles.

In this case, it's the demo for Cupiclaw, which is possibly the first ever "roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game". You know how Balatro made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you. Here's a trailer.

We know that the 'Switch 2' is real. We know an announcement is coming this fiscal year. We know "Switch successor" is the most accurate description of it. All of the other big details — what form it will take, how big it will be, whether it will finally give us that flipping Wind Waker port — are all up to speculation and analysis for the time being.
Take, perhaps, one of the biggest questions of them all: How much will 'Switch 2' cost? In the absence of an official announcement, we still have no idea, but that hasn't stopped certain analysts from throwing out predictions and it won't stop us from looking to the past to try and determine the future.

As a long-time mainline Bethesda fan, I feel like it's pretty important to note that the release of an actual driveable non-hat vehicle in one of the studio's RPGs is monumental stuff. The fact that it's fun, useful, and seemingly universally beloved at this point is a huge boon for the game, too, and the community is absolutely all in on the current REV-8 zeitgeist.

Well, good news then, because the physics-driven Corpus Edax - following the Thief and Dark Messiah schools of game design - is coming out very soon.


Corpus Edax describes itself as a lo-fi sci-fi immersive first-person melee RPG that's "set in a distant retro-futuristic city on the brink of a revolution and on a planet that hides its own secrets." It's a bit of a mouthful, to be frank, but there's really no easy way to describe a true immersive sim without resorting to tongue-tying exercises, honestly. Those who enjoyed Dark Messiah of Might and Magic back in the day will find much to enjoy in Corpus Edax' new release date trailer, I feel.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

Although there's no mention of a Nintendo release, it seems like there's a good chance of one in the future, with the Switch "successor" announcement scheduled to take place at some point "this fiscal year".

This open-world action RPG adventure is now on its way to the Xbox this November, and yet there are still no updates about the Nintendo version, which was originally confirmed in 2020 - with a trailer at the time noting how it was "coming soon" to the hybrid platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

There are Nazis to fight in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - a globe-trotting, tomb-robbing adventure featuring a Lost Ark-era Harrison Ford - but as you'd expect from a Lucasfilm adaptation, there's rather less of the bloodshed.

We were more than a bit surprised when Sid Meier's Civilization VII was confirmed to be coming to Switch at Summer Game Fest 2024. And at Gamescom, we found out when we can expect to play the game on all consoles — 11th February 2025.
Debuting alongside the release date was the first-look at the gameplay, nd it looks absolutely stunning. Of course, we don't have Switch footage yet — and we're sort of staggered that they'll be able to squeeze the game onto the console — but hopefully it'll look nice on the hybrid console. Well, we'll find out early next year.

So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

It's safe to say that King of Meat has sprung out of nowhere. Developed by Guildford-based studio Glowmade and published by Amazon Games, it was one of the genuinely new announcements in Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and you may be wondering what exactly it has in store.
We were in the same boat when we were invited by the publisher to a preview event earlier this month. But, after watching the trailer, hearing from the developer, and getting to go hands-on for roughly two hours, we're starting to build up a pretty good picture of what it's all about.

We've been waiting for news of Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh on Switch for a while now (ever since it was first teased back in 2022, to be precise), but it looks like we won't have to wait too much longer. Publishers Tintinimaginatio and Microids have finally revealed that the detective's latest adventure will be flying over to Switch on 17th October 2024.
The game launched on PlayStation and Xbox last year in a pretty sorry state (one that developer Pendulo Studios apologised for on release day), though the announcement of the Switch release comes with a glimmer of hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

As an M-rated game being published by Nintendo, there's certainly been a lot more interest in Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club in the lead-up to its release than there might have been with a more...well, Nintendo-esque content rating attached.
Whether it deserves the full-blown adult treatment, we've yet to discern as we've only had time with the prologue and first chapter so far, which you too should have access to at the time of writing via the multipart demo hitting the Switch eShop. But what we can say, is that this is an intriguingly dark game from the get-go whilst still remaining something that long-time fans of the Famicom Detective Club series should feel right at home playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets?

It's all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation.

I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

The platform's servers were targeted in a police raid just months after a French court ordered ISPs to block the site. Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it's not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

They can’t hurt you. They’re actually known for not being able to move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conan Throwbrien welcomes its host to the stage with discordant jazz and uncanny colour bars glitches. It feels eerie. Desperate. A crushing inevitability. Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

RuTube is currently awash with pirated copies of Hollywood movies and, during the summer, RuTube used imagery from Barbie and Oppenheimer to advertise the fact. Last week, Russian telecoms operators gave RuTube another boost by massively throttling YouTube. On Friday, RuTube's apps were suddenly removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play.

The Hi-Fi Rush studio have been acquired - alongside the IP for future games in the rhythm action series - by South Korean company Krafton, who also own PUBG Studios and Striking Distance, among others. “This strategic move will include the rights to Tango Gameworks’ acclaimed IP, Hi-Fi Rush,” Krafton said in a statement today. I particularly enjoy the hand-rubbing, grinning use of the word ‘strategic’ here. Great news though.

So far, Lidl's own brand remains the clear winner, a solid 8 on the taste meter at just 59p. But while writing this, I'm sipping an "Intenso" Arctic Coffee from Morrisons, which is giving the Lidl frontrunners some stiff competition at last, albeit at 145% the cost. Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.
