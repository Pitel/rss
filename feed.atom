        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel that the SNES was the last major console that had a sound of its own. That’s not to say that later consoles don’t have great music. It’s just that the limitations of the 8 and 16-bit eras gave their platforms a unique voice. After the shift to CD, that was lost.


The Nintendo S-SMP, created by Ken Kutaragi, was one of the most sophisticated console sound hardware at the time. But while that didn’t necessarily give it an advantage over the PC-Engine/Turbografx or Sega Genesis/Megadrive, it did give it a unique sound among its competitors. This led to more fantastic soundtracks than I can name.


Really, while I picked ten SNES soundtracks for this best-of list, there are many more that I considered. Games like Demon’s Crest, Addams Family Values, Final Fantasy VI, Yoshi’s Island, Ju…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.
What do you think Xbox will announce next week? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

To be fair, this is essentially two 32-inch 4K 240Hz monitors without the gap in the middle, with a Mini LED backlight that delivers 1000-nit HDR highlights, an absolute beast of a monitor... but I'm guessing that most people that can drop nearly $2000 on a monitor aren't waiting for a deals post on Rock Paper Shotgun to do so. 
Still, I can dream, and this monitor is pretty cool, so let's take a closer look at this absolute bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It didn't take long for the Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, to respond to the latest rumors. Those looking for an immediate conclusion will have to wait a little longer, however. According to Spencer, a business update event is planned for next week which is where Xbox will share more details about its vision and future.





"We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned."
- Phil Spencer, Head of Xbox



So we now know that more info is coming soon, but that's about it. I will say however that this statement isn't a denial, which I'm sure some could argue is an answer in itself.


Xbox Fans seem to be a bit scattered based on the comments in Phil's Twitter thread, with some open to the idea of Xbox first-party titles coming to PlayStation, while others claim it will devalue what it means to be an Xbox player.


I obviously have no idea where this is going, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if Xbox starts to shed its exclusivity of first-party titles. Like Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said, the console war is over. At this point, Xbox and by extension, Microsoft is going to look to make money where it can. And with the PlayStation 5 recently reaching 50 million units sold, there are a lot of potential customers.

That's more than £75 cheaper than the 13th and 14th-gen equivalents, which add on only meagre levels of performance, and a great price for a CPU that can use the same DDR4 or DDR5 motherboards with PCIe 5.0 support. If you're building an Intel-based gaming PC, I'd argue that this is the best budget option going!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-developed open-world pirate adventure Skull and Bones is finally going to see its release on February 16. However, a beta event that is open to everyone kicks off in just a few days on February 8 and lasts through February 11. Anyone can jump in and play for free up to the rank of Infamy Brigand, which is Tier 6 Rank 1. Thankfully, all progression from the beta carries over to the full release, so anyone interested in checking it out has no reason not to!




A Content-Filled Open Beta


Even though progression in the open beta only goes up to the Infamy Brigand rank, there is a ton of content in the beta. All of the regions are accessible and explorable, as well as the ability to access the Helm of your ship. There are also dynamic events active in-game allowing players to battle against Ghost Ships, Sea Monsters, Merchant Convoys, and Elite Warships.


Also, cross-play and cross-progression are enabled for the open beta. This means players across all platforms—PC(Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S can all play together. Furthermore, you can switch between the platforms you are playing on and your data will be saved and available on each.


Those who participate in the beta also get access to some exclusive cosmetic rewards including a Basilisk I Culverin cannon, a Sail Emblem and Sail Pattern for your ship, a Cookie the Lemur pet, and a sign language emote.


Skull and Bones has had quite a journey over the past few years. I was a huge fan of ship combat in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which is where Skull and Bones supposedly originally got its premise. It's evolved quite a bit since then, but even still I'm interested in seeing what it has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few things are consistent in games. Studios often change and shift over the years, bringing in new ideas and retiring old concepts. But bless Vanillaware, their food has never stopped looking incredible, as the latest trailer for Unicorn Overlord shows.


The most recent entry in Atlus and Vanillaware's series of instructional videos, introducing various gameplay elements in Unicorn Overlord, covers unity and relationships within your party. It's a big army, and as we all know, love can—and will—bloom on the battlefield.

Allies in Vanillaware's upcoming tactical RPG can build rapport with each other while fighting in the same unit. Eventually, this leads to both in-battle boons and off-hours conversations.




Bon Appetit


While you could just fall in love through combat, food is also a fast way to someone's heart. And Unicorn Overlord certainly seems to have that in spa- oh my, Margherita pizza, my favorite! Vanillaware, how did you know?


Image via Atlus/Vanillaware


In all seriousness, food has long been the secret weapon of Vanillaware's art department, and I'm glad to see their fantasy fare has not dipped in deliciousness. Eating meals, as well as gift-giving, is another way to up those bonds and forge new ones in Unicorn Overlord.


Between all this comradery and all the possible classes that could await, Unicorn Overlord is looking like something tactics sickos should keep an eye on. We're not far out from release, either. The latest from Vanillaware is due out on March 8 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

We learn how the team has gradually been auditing the core systems in Apex to trim the fat accumulated since the battle royale entered the scene five years ago and how exactly those gameplay changes affect the core player base.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming flagship first-person RPG, Avowed, may have a smudge of weirdness in it. In a recent interview, Avowed director Carrie Patel explained that the game's already iconic mutated skeleton warrior may have been inspired by Jeff Vandermeer's Annihilation, a popular New Weird novel.


Press Start's James Wood interviewed Carrie Patel and her fellow director, Gabe Paramo, about Avowed. It's an interesting and engaging piece that helps put much of Avowed's previously shown-off gameplay footage into context, but the really curious bit comes at the end. When checking out Avowed's splayed-out key art skeleton, Wood was reminded of Vandermeer's haunting horror/sci-fi thriller. With that in mind, he brought the matter up with Patel, who was thrilled that he did so.

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

We love a good bit of video game music. Whether it is keeping us company throughout a gruelling boss battle or stuck on in the background while we make our dinner in the evening, there is something about these tunes that just hits different. Despite all of these hours getting familiar with the scores, however, very few of us know what goes into making a track. Until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars franchise has always been renowned for its iconic music. The series has earned plenty of big-time nominations and award wins over the last 45 years. Many of these came thanks to one of the best to ever do it in composer John Williams. Now, after last night's Grammy Awards, we add a few more names to that list. 


Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab of Respawn Entertainment nabbed the hardware for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, for their excellent work on the excellent Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Their accomplishment earned the duo a shoutout from the official Star Wars X account. 




Barton and Haab beat out some pretty stiff competition for the 2024 Grammy. The duo bested composers who worked on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical.


This is the second year the Grammys has issued an award in the category of Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. Last year, Stephanie Economou won the award for her work on Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök.


Prior to 2023, video games could only earn nominations for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Only one video game had previously earned a Grammy nomination for its outstanding soundtrack: in 2013, Austin Wintory won for his work on Journey.


It isn't just the Grammy win that the Respawn team should be proud of. For their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the developer also accumulated numerous nominations across the Golden Joystick Awards, The Game Awards, and The Steam Awards. The game also has four nominations at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, which will take place on February 15.

On the surface, this might look like your typical fantasy dungeon crawler, but Pyrene has some neat tricks of its own, combining its own blend of resource gathering and roguelike citybuilding with Inscryption's number-crunching battles and a dash of Foretales' card-based exploration. And it has a lovely piano soundtrack to boot, too.

Let's start with the reports themselves. Over at The Verge, Tom Warren reports from a source familiar with Microsoft's plans that Bethesda is considering bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to PlayStation 5.  Furthermore, a new "multi-platform approach" is emerging within Microsoft, as The Verge reports, which would lead to some titles remaining exclusive and others heading to external platforms in the future.

But in the years that followed, after you'd been sent to the slammer for crashing through my window bellowing about cheap Audible subscriptions, I might have checked out games like Ghost Trick and Phantom Brigade - each sort of an exercise in placing actions on a timeline like audio layers to produce a winning composition - and thought "hey, that hysterical burglar was onto something".
I wouldn't say there's an abundance of games in which you place actions on timelines, mind you. But those that do exist are neat, as Marge Simpson would say. Take Tarnished Blood.

Later this week, Metroid: Zero Mission turns 20. This GBA reimagining transforms the original, iconic 8-bit Metroid — a game that can be hard to return to these days — into a stunning retelling of Samus' first adventure with a graphical overhaul, various Super Metroid-inspired tweaks, and a fun Zero Suit epilogue to boot. It's so good, in fact, that it rivals the SNES entry in the affections of several Nintendo Life writers.
As we reflected on Zero Mission's excellence ahead of its anniversary, it got us wondering: Which is the best remake from Nintendo's roster of reimaginings? We're not talking remasters or HD ports — we mean full-on reworkings that switch out models and rebuild the game from the ground up.

GloriousEggroll, the person responsible for the continued development of Proton-GE, has just announced that they are joining forces with the developers of Lutris, Heroic, and Bottles to work on a Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher. ULWGL is a universal non-Steam game launcher that will expand the Steam Deck's game support by a huge margin, making it way easier to run any given non-Steam title with all of the functionality that Proton-GE might afford.

That decade-plus drought finally ends soon. Square Enix confirmed that the Final Fantasy XIV open beta heads to Xbox Series X|S on February 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Indeed, an unannounced single-player Titanfall game was quietly shelved last year, and if there’s any burning sense of unfinished business among series devs Respawn Entertainment, it wasn’t evident during my recent visit to try out Apex Legends’ Season 20 update.
Even so, it turns out some still carry the fire, at least as source of inspiration for Apex lore and mechanics. I asked Respawn’s narrative lead Ashley Reed whether Titanfall was keeping in anyone’s minds, and was told that if anything, the references need reining in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a secret to how Apex Legends has endured the past five years, an era marked by as many FPS failures as successes, then it might be this: there are no sacred cows in live service. Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.
Then again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.

The fact that Starfield's Creation Kit modding tools are not out yet keeps the game's modding community focused on simple tweaks, retexture mods, and configuration changes, instead of adding entirely new gear, features, and mechs. That hasn't stopped JaeDL from trying their best to bump things up a notch for Starfield, though, and the end result is Royal Galaxy  — over 40 disparate mods and fixes bundled into one comprehensive, streamlined plugin.

Officially titled 'Record's Fragment: Keian Command Championship' (catchy little name that, eh?), we still don't know all that much about what the add-on will hold. Koei Tecmo's website reveals that the first DLC package will see you working your way through a "mysterious tournament" which has been started out of the blue by the boss of Babyloni-ya, but that's all we know — mysterious indeed.

The best thing we can ever say about a game is that we wanted to keep playing it on our own time after we’ve wrapped up a review. We wish we could tell you that’s the case with Grime. It should be; there’s a really great Souls-inspired Metroidvania here. But a number of technical aspects turn what should be a chip off the ol’ block into a really rocky time. And not in a fun way.
Grime Definitive Edition is the long-awaited Switch port of Grime, which released on PC in 2021. The Definitive Edition includes all of the previously released DLC, as well as the new, final Parting Shade DLC to cap everything off.

This isn't confirmation that a third single player Last Of Us game is in development, with Druckmann reiterating comments from this time last year that Naughty Dog feel no obligation to continue the tale.

In the UK this week, two new releases took the top 2 spots in the charts, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League coming in at number 1, and Persona 3 Reload taking the silver medal. Suicide Squad's triumph might be somewhat surprising given the relatively mixed critical reception, but nevertheless, it's a big win here for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games
Elsewhere, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth has tumbled from number 2 down to number 28. There's no doubt that the franchise has somewhat of a niche audience here in the UK, but that fall definitely hurts to see.

Here are a few games we're aiming the ol' scrying crystals at this week: alchemy-themed puzzle adventure CLeM (6th Feb); 1980s-styled "Tetris + flying car" puzzler Space Garbage (6th Feb); Coven-building "4X card game" WitchHand (7th Feb); spoofy sci-fascist shooter Helldivers 2 (8th Feb); alt-theological dark fantasy The Inquisitor (8th Feb). Mind you, this week it's all about the demos. That's right, it's time for another Steam Next Fest - have you had a chance to play any demos so far? Participating developers have taken to stuffing them up a few days in advance to beat the rush.

There's no firm release date in place at the moment, but the game is basically 'Overcooked in Space', and quite frankly that's more than enough to get us on board. The general premise is that you must work together with your teammates to deliver fuel to your customers, playing around with wacky physics to pump the fuel through moveable pipes.

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE superstar Brock Lesnar has been removed from the 2K mobile game WWE Supercard, the latest in a series of changes following a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations against former WWE owner Vince McMahon. 


Though Lesnar is not mentioned by name in a sexual assault and trafficking lawsuit against former WWE owner Vince McMahon from Janel Grant, there are several references to an individual who is believed to be Lesnar. 


Screenshot via WWE 2K's YouTube channel


Why Brock Lesnar may have been removed from WWE Supercard


The lawsuit only names a "former UFC Heavyweight Champion" who was allegedly contacted by McMahon. Cageside Seats reports "McMahon [allegedly] enticed [Lesnar] to sign a new contract in August 2021 by offering Grant as 'a sexual commodity' for his use."


According to the lawsuit, the individual in question showed interest in a sexual encounter, but "a snowstorm changed WWE Superstar's travel plans, and Ms. Grant ultimately used the weather and COVID-19 as an excuse to back out."


Brock Lesnar is the only male UFC Heavyweight champion who was prominent on WWE programming during the events, leading many to speculate he was involved. 


Though Lesnar's involvement has not been confirmed in court, he's now been removed from WWE Supercard. It is also rumored that Lesnar was taken off the 2024 Royal Rumble card, with many reporting that former NXT champion Bron Breakker took his place. 


With all these changes, fan's eyes are now on the roster of the upcoming WWE 2K24, as many wonder if he'll be featured in the game. WWE 2K24 is scheduled to be released on March 8 for those who buy the standard edition, with an early access period for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition or Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition. A full roster has yet to be announced, so fans will have to wait until closer to release to confirm if Lesnar is on the roster or not.

I am struggling through a string of frustrating moments that feel repetitive and dated. I'm about three to four hours into the game, and I think I've seen everything it has to offer already. 


I may be disastrously wrong, of course, and things could do a full 180-degree turn 5 hours in. Nevertheless, if this is the nature of the whole title, I cannot recommend it.

Does it matter who you're playing as during the game's early hours? Yes, a little bit. The characters have unique personalities and content. Quinn is a good example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're planning to dive into the world of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, don't expect Cliff to be with you. According to creator and game director Hideo Kojima, Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal) will not be returning for the 2025 sequel.


For those who need a quick reminder, Mads Mikkelsen played Captain Cliff Unger, the secondary antagonist, in the original Death Stranding, released in 2019. Throughout the game, Cliff would bring Sam into his war-themed Beach and attack him with BTs. Mads' performance as the militant entity brought him critical acclaim, leading to several awards, including Best Performance at The Game Awards that year.




Why isn't Mads Mikkelsen in Death Stranding 2: On The Beach?


Despite the overwhelming praise for Mads' role in Death Stranding, Kojima explained both he and Mads believe that Cliff's story was told the best way possible and want to close that chapter on the character. 


While I was a fan of Cliff in the original, I wholeheartedly agree that the character shouldn't come back. It feels wrong when any form of entertainment brings well-off characters back for nostalgia or shock value. I'm looking at you, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with your Arkham Batman. 


Regardless, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach looks like a wild ride. Its latest trailer at the recent State of Play was...interesting. Troy Baker's Higgs is alive and looking like Gene Simmons and The Joker had a baby, and we now have a sentient puppet moving at 10 fps. Oh, and Mad Max director George Miller is here. I'm sure it'll all make sense when the game releases in 2025, but it's still crazy to think it could get weirder. 


For fans of Cliff, don't lose hope just yet. We may see the character done in live-action from the A24 adaptation of Kojima's 'Strand' genre game. I wouldn't put it past Kojima to cast everyone, even Mads, as their characters again. All we can do is wait and see.

We're republishing this list in honour of one of the best Sonic games of all time, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which celebrated its 30th birthday on 2nd February 2024.


It was back in 1991 that Sonic the Hedgehog — the blue dude with the most 'tude — first burst forth onto the Mega Drive in Japan and Sega finally presented a credible challenger for the platforming crown Nintendo's jumping plumber had been wearing since the mid-1980s. In the decades since, the blue blur has starred in a host of platform games: some 2D, others 3D, some fantastic, others not so much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For over 13 years the Momodora games have delivered exponential delights, like someone constantly returning to the drawing board to take one more crack at their favorite creation. If Momodora: Moonlit Farewell is the culmination of all that effort, it puts on a hell of a display.


Guilherme "rdein" Martins has been putting in the work with his studio Bombservice since the first Momodora launched in 2010, quickly followed by Momodora II in 2011 and Momodora III in 2014. The first two games are, as even the itch.io page on which they're available states, “very roughly put together and fairly unpolished.” There's still something to them that was even more visible in the third entry, though, and by the time the fourth game arrived in 2016 there was clearly a major evolution underway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through social media platforms, targeted advertising, and 'news' articles published in the tabloids, UK consumers of pirate IPTV and similar streaming platforms are being exposed to very specific messaging. Broadly speaking, pirates face threats to their security, finances, even their identities. So how do they feel after 120+ days of threat message exposure? According to a new study, women may respond positively to this kind of messaging while motivation to pirate in males could increase by up to 30%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a new anime season will start and I’ll find one series, in particular, to latch onto like a vice. This season, that series is Sasaki and Peeps. In only a couple of episodes, this series has shown me edge-of-your-seat action and rapidly developing plots and has dipped its toes into so many genres that it’s hard to even know what to classify this series as. The point is that Sasaki and Peeps has something to please everyone!


First released in Japan in 2018 as a light novel, Sasaki and Peeps currently has eight volumes out in Japan (five of which have been translated into English by Yen Press). The anime adaptation, with animation produced by Silver Link, was first announced in 2022.

The news, tweeted by Max, is the fourth major casting for the new season. Just last month, they cast Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Beef‘s Young Mazino as Jesse, and Superman: Legacy’s Isabela Merced as Dina.




Funny enough, while appearing for Argylle with co-star Bryan Cranston on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, a call-in fan asked about her involvement. She responds “How do you know these things?” and genuinely looks concerned, like she lost Kevin again. She later says that “her son’s a set dresser on the show...so I get to see him, too.”

It’s Christmas morning, and amidst the thick haze of food already cooking for lunch and the soothing laughter of our children enjoying their new toys, my wife approaches me with a small, square package. I hadn’t seen this under the tree. “That’s your last one,” she says. I instinctively go to shake it – she knows me well enough to catch my wrist. “Don’t do that!” she interjects. Clearly this is an item of some delicacy.
I unwrap it carefully, and as I slip the box free of its decorative coat, I am filled with both giddy elation and a crushing sense of shame: Shame at the sheer averageness of the gifts I have offered her this year compared to the magnificence I hold in my hands; elated, because said magnificence is a boxed, Japanese copy of Mario’s Tennis for the Virtual Boy with manual inside. It’s a Christmas miracle. Eat your heart out, Dickens.

Before the appointment of Sarah Natochenny as the voice of Pokémon's Ash Ketchum, the voice actor in the English version of the series was actually Veronica Taylor. Now that Ash's arc has come to an end in the anime series, Taylor has reflected on the time when she was essentially "fired" from the role.
As a result of the abrupt recast in 2006, Taylor still struggles and isn't even sure she's properly said goodbye to Ash just yet. She further notes how her case isn't an isolated one and that it's just the unfortunate realities of the acting industry.

It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2: On The Beach’s latest trailer is aggressively bizarre. In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. 
It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff. They’re not easy to spot, so I took the liberty…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Umihara Kawase is a weird game to explain, but I’m going to try to anyway. It looks and sounds like an amateur production put out by some unknown publisher and created by some unknown developer, and maybe it is. But it’s also one of the best games on the Super Famicom.


I first heard about it on GameCenter CX (season 5, episode 1), and that was around the time that the series was finally making it stateside with Yumi’s Odd Odyssey (Sayonara Umihara Kawase). I finally jumped into the series in 2020 with Umihara Kawase Fresh, which was the topic of my second review ever written here at Destructoid. I absolutely loved it, which made me go back and finally play the earlier titles.


And you should, too.

It's wise to take advice, especially from the experienced, but what happens when our internal desires clash with the stories society outlined for us?


In Alan Wake 2, Saga finds herself confronting this many-faced problem. However, in typical Remedy fashion, things are presented through metanarratives that defy convention. Through Saga, we discover the power these tales have in our lives, and how a steely inner resolve gives us the reality-changing ability to forge our own way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best way to describe Phantom Abyss is that it feels like a fever dream you have after falling asleep with Temple of Doom still playing on your TV.


It is an action-adventure game that, at its best, makes you feel like an explorer encountering mystery and danger at every turn. Spectral guardians chase you through temples filled with devious traps and secret paths full of treasure. 


Exploring the game’s various regions in Adventure Mode is initially thrilling, but as the experience drags on – and the quirks of the game’s random generation become more predictable – Phantom Abyss becomes less like classic Indiana Jones and more like a by-the-numbers summer blockbuster.

It's on track to go out as one of the most tepid seasonal experiences in recent Destiny 2 memory, sidestepping any pomp and circumstance surrounding the last official season. And that's a bummer, considering Bungie previously promised some significant changes for Season 23.


Following the upcoming The Final Shape expansion in June, the game will switch to a new format called Episodes. While Season of the Wish should have been a swan song of the seasonal model, showcasing years of implemented improvement and teeing up what players might be excited about with the new episodic format, it's just been pretty forgettable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for Game Informer (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.
There is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.

I am not a fan of the genre Suicid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the franchise has been around since the initial game in 2005, the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series has really seemed to pick up mainstream popularity over the last few entries. Today, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio has confirmed just that. 


The Sega-owned developers revealed that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has already crossed over the 1,000,000 copies shipped threshold. It took the game a mere week to do so. 




When you look at review scores across the industry for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, it's easy to see why the latest core entry to the series is doing so hot. Destructoid gave the game a great review. On Metacritic the title earned a 92, 89, and 89 across the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC respectively. 


The series did a bit of a soft reboot with 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon into RPG territory. As stated in our Infinite Wealth review, it has been a bit of a transition period for the franchise as the developers settle in on their vision, but RGG seems to have nailed it. It's clear from these sales that the series' fanbase is excited about where it's headed.


To commemorate Infinite Wealth's achievement, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio is releasing free in-game swag as a reward to players for helping in the title's success. The development team will be gifting a celebratory T-shirt set with timing and further details coming at a later date. 


If you're still working your way through Infinite Wealth with its seemingly infinite things to do, check out Destructoid's Infinite Wealth hub. It features fantastic guides, walkthroughs, and plenty more to help get you all the cash and glory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 
Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 
Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 


All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.

I'd arranged with some pals to play an online board game with them that evening, and when news hit that it might actually be a reasonably big deal for us PC folks, I ambitiously thought: I can proooobably do both at the same time??? Reader, I was wrong, at least for the most part. The first 30 minutes of it was arguably fine, but then the 10-minute trailer for Death Stranding 2 arrived and I simply had to throw my hands up in defeat. I honestly did not understand what I was watching, and even several re-watches later, I'm still not 100% sure what Kojima thinks he's playing at.
But hot damn, do I love it anyway.

I was instantly smitten with this one when it was first unveiled at the end of 2022, and the more I've seen of it, the more it's risen into becoming one of my most anticipated games of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning brought us our first Sonic the Hedgehog 3 teaser trailer, and with it, indications that Jim Carrey will return as the nefarious Dr. Robotnik. 


Paramount Pictures dropped the twenty-second tease this morning which showcased the Sonic 3 logo alongside confirmation of the movie's December 2024 release date. In the background audio of the clip, you can hear Jim Carrey's distinct laughter as the iconic Sonic villain.




You don't have to merely go on Carrey's Doctor Eggman laugh as proof of his return. Variety also confirmed the news this morning. 


Carrey, one of the most prolific comedic actors of all time, revealed in 2022 that he would be retiring from acting. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Carrey stated "I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious." 


He went on to note that he likes "my quiet life." Carrey said, "If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break.”


Carrey's quote came out shortly before Sonic the Hedgehog 2 went on to be wildly successful at the box office. So while the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 script likely isn't "written in gold ink," Carrey's paycheck to return as Dr. Robotnik just may be. 


You won't have to wait until December to get your Sonic movie universe fix, though. Knuckles, a six-episode live-action series is planned for early 2024 on Paramount Plus. The series will feature Idris Elba returning to voice the warrior Echidna. It will take place between the events of the Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every Destiny 2 fan almost certainly knows by now that the game's director, Joe Blackburn, will be leaving the project ahead of The Final Shape's release later this year. The less widespread piece of information is that Blackburn's replacement, Tyson Green, may well be bringing the heat with him.


Notably, Bungie's latest TWID blog post has been dedicated to thanking Blackburn for all his hard work on Destiny, but the text also gives context to Green's tenure at Bungie, and it's very impressive indeed. "From leading multiplayer and Forge efforts in Halo 3, to most recently supporting the development of Fireteam Finder (among many other efforts), Tyson’s creativity and expertise have been a critical part of Bungie’s success and legacy," says the blog.

It may be surprising, though, that one of them would be Deep Rock Galactic: Survivors, which is launching soon.


As one of the most-played Steam Next Fest demos of October 2023, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivors has already proven that there's merit in adapting the franchise's trademark dwarven mining action into an entirely different genre. Now, Ghost Ship Games has announced that DRG: Survivors will be released into Early Access on February 14, kicking off its own production cycle proper.

Now, Jump Over The Age has confirmed that, yep, "there's around a year left of development" to go on the game, putting its release firmly into 2025 territory.

Macca’s all-new Chocolate Soft Serve is shaking up summer. To mark the occasion, Team PWR are putting their Fortnite speed skills to the test. If you think you’ve got what it takes to beat the Macca’s ChocClock, show us your best two-minute Fortnite challenge and you can win an armful of PWR merchandise. Just try not to get any soft serve on it. 


Summer doesn’t have to be vanilla. If you’re feeling the heat, head to your nearest Macca’s to get your favorite McFlurry, cone, or sundae in delicious chocolate soft serve. That’s something worth celebrating, which is why Macca’s has teamed up with PWR for the #MaccasRaceTheChoc speedrun challenge. Team PWR’s Lachlan has devised a special Fortnite challenge for teammates Bananahead, Vindooly, Overstrand, and Chanzes. You can bet he didn’t let them off easy! See it for yourselves in the video below.




Now that you’ve seen Team PWR in action against the Choc Clock, you have the chance to win prizes by cooking up a challenge of your own! Think you’re as good Team PWR, or maybe even better? Post your own video with the #MaccasRaceTheChoc and if PWR picks you as one of two winners, you’ll get an official PWR t-shirt, hoodie, mouse mat, and more.

Sonic Mania is widely regarded as one of the blue blur’s best games. More than six years after its 2017 release, that sentiment remains as strong as ever, even after recent outings like 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and this year’s Sonic Superstars. While published by Sega, longtime Sonic fans who grew up playing the series, like Christian Whitehead, Hunter Bridges, Dave Padilla, Brad Flick, Tom Fry, and others, led the game’s development. And without speculating too much, the degree of separation afforded to these fans-turned-developers allowed Sonic Mania to feel l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was just yesterday that I was espousing the benefits of the newly released Ryzen 7 5700X3D processor - a cutback version of legendary 5800X3D that breathes new life and exceptional gaming performance into classic Ryzen 1000, 2000, 3000 and 5000 systems. I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. 
Now though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!

The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don't own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dig back far enough into the history of any word and you'll find something sinister. Take "cute". Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase "that's a cute observation, Edwin". But the word originally evolved from "acute", which very broadly means sharp or intense. "Acute" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to "ague", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word "cute", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called "cute aggression" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - "I just want to squeeze you till you pop".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 was a fantastic game, and the addition of a revamped Separate Ways DLC made it even better. But if you’ve been holding out on jumping into Leon’s mission to save Ashley, now may be a good time to take on Las Plagas with the announcement of Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition.


Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven't picked up the game on console, PC, iOS, or PS VR2, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package. 
Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.]]></summary>

When one subscriber did just that, the court took a closer look at the DMCA subpoena disclosure 'shortcut.'

Listen, it was very early in the morning at the time, and it must have come at a peak eyes-glazing-over moment for me. However, having now played the first 30 minutes of Tales Of Kenzera thanks to its just-released early Steam Next Fest demo, I have seen the error of my ways. The demo might only cover the game's opening, but this 2.5D Metroidvania already looks to be quite the promising newcomer in this ever-crowded genre - so much so that it may even be able to go toe to toe with Ubisoft's Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown. Yep, I went there.

Last year's multimedia horror extravaganza game has a new patch, and of note is that it includes chapter select but, interestingly, also the "much-requested option to tune down the horror flashes", according to the notes here. What is a horror flash, you ask? It's that thing where a horror game or film or TV show suddenly flashes up a semi-transparent image of like, a monster, or a screaming woman, or a big weird eye. A jump scare meets the Kuleshov effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.
Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.
And for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.

I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.

WWE 2K has steadily climbed the ladder of quality over the past two entries. A strong comeback in 2K22 saw initiative but meaningful improvements in 2K23, and the series is arguably the strongest it's ever been. But a new year means another opportunity to retain the title for best wrestling sim or drop it to someone else. On the morning of the Royal Rumble last Saturday, I got to sample WWE 2K24’s notable new additions at a special preview event. That includes the new Showcase mode documenting 40 years of WrestleMania, the new Ambulance Match type, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great 3D platformer seems to be a rare and special thing these days. I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.
So where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RPS Game Club is back in action for 2024 today, and our first pick of the year is the exceedingly good Cobalt Core, a spaceship roguelike deckbuilder where you're slipping and sliding out the way of incoming missiles to get to the bottom of why you and the rest of your animal pals seem to be stuck in a pesky timeloop. I had an absolute blast with it when it came out at the end of last year, and really, this is just the perfect excuse to shove it back in front of your faces again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, the survival game filled with legally distinct Pokémon and numerous Glock-19s, has received its first major patch. Straight off the production line are fixes to crashes, as well as enemy pals getting stuck in walls. And if you've been plagued by other players stealing your flock, then worry no longer, as pal spheres chucked at your low-HP pals won't capture them anymore. Breeding also becomes easier, with the removal of some annoying flourishes. There's a lot more and it gets progressively sillier.

Set in 19th century Japan's Bakumatsu era, the game is a mixture of open-ended exploration, sneaking and agile traversal that puts me heavily in mind of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Unlike most Assassin's Creeds, however, this one has a pretty in-depth, rigorous melee combat system, with bosses that look like they're going to grind my gears no end. Will it be as vicious as Nioh 2? I'd better start stocking up on comfort food.

        <updated>2024-02-01T00:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.
Sonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.
In July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. "Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," Iizuka says. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time."
By adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.
Sonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony and Hideo Kojima have released a new Death Stranding 2 trailer alongside the game's full title - Death Stranding 2 On The Beach. It's out in 2025 on PS5, with a PC release date still to be revealed, and appears to be as free-wheeling and self-serious yet whimsical as you'd expect from a Kojima joint. I got as far as the pet anime dragon before my brain squirmed out through my ear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.
The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. 


Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-31T22:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.
If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 


Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 
He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Team Ninja have released a new trailer for Rise of the Ronin, and it features plenty of bloody gameplay and new details about the Bakumatsu period in Japan. There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. 
In combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. 
Rise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out. You can read more about that in Game Informer's Rise of the Ronin preview here. 
Check out all the new gameplay in the latest Rise of the Ronin trailer below: 


Rise of the Ronin hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation stream brought some great news for players on Sony consoles. Dave the Diver is headed to Playstation in April, meaning that players who weren’t able to catch the game on Switch or PC will now have a chance to join Dave on his adventures.
As we highlighted in the game’s review, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.


Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed that a remake of Until Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. Notably, this PC release means more people will get to experience developer Supermassive Games' breakout narrative-driven horror. However, it's unclear if Supermassive is developing this or if a different team is handling it. 
PlayStation revealed this new version of Until Dawn, which it says has been "rebuilt" for PS5, during today's State of Play in a new cinematic trailer that highlights the improved fidelity. This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game. 
Check out the Until Dawn remake trailer for yourself below: 


For more, read Game Informer's review of Until Dawn, and then check out our thoughts on its PlayStation VR spin-off, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. Supermassive released a spiritual successor to Until Dawn in 2022 called The Quarry – read Game Informer's review here – but its next game is Little Nightmares III, which is due out sometime this year.

The trailer doesn't offer a ton in the ways of storytelling set up, instead serving as a flashy highlight reel of what's likely the game's strongest suit: action. Whether you're slaying beasts with swords and axes or blasting them with magic, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks as thrilling as fans would expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's PlayStation State of Play delivered a new Death Stranding 2 trailer and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is weird as hell. The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, "These days I am Fragile in name only," before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.


The trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.

Other interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.
The trailer ended with the phrase, "Should we have connected?" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the PlayStation 5 exclusive game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Sony's most recent State of Play, Konami unveiled a brand new Silent Hill project. Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.
Check out the trailer below to see it for yourself. Though as a quick heads-up, there are brief scenes of self-harm.


The Short Message trailer looks conspicuously like the alleged leaked images for a new Silent Hill game we saw back in February 2022 that Konami DMCA'd. As Polygon detailed at the time, the leaker "Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow." This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.
Despite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall. It appears the future of Silent Hill is as bright as it is foggy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2011, as the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 20 years old, Sega and Sonic Team decided to celebrate with Sonic Generations, a game that remade various iconic and fan-favorite zones from Sonic's past in both 3D and modern 2D versions. The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.


As the name implies, Sonic x Shadow Generations remasters the well-liked title for modern consoles but adds various enhancements. While 60 frames-per-second performance is already attainable by playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox Series X console, Sonic x Shadow Generations brings much more to the table. In addition to remastering the Sonic levels, this version adds Shadow as a playable character alongside new levels for him.
Sonic x Shadow Generations will be available this fall for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen little of Stellar Blade since its reveal way back in 2021, but during today's State of Play event, we got a new deep dive into the upcoming action game. Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. 
Players will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. 
Check out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: 


In Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. 
Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024.

Previously your only option was the (superb) 5800X3D, which uses a 3D V-Cache to massively boost gaming performance, but now the cheaper 5700X3D is also available. 
Made from silicon that wasn't quite good enough to turn into the 5800X3D, these processors boost slightly lower but come with the same complement of extra L3 cache, making them still head and shoulders above models like the 5600X, 5800X, 5900X and even 5950X - not to mention older Ryzen 1000, 2000 and 3000 models.
Following its launch this month, the brand new Ryzen 7 5700X3D is now available from B&H Photo and Amazon in the US for $249 or Amazon UK for £233, a great price that undercuts the $308 5800X3D significantly. Here's some links:

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

The limited-time mode (LTM) dropped alongside Season 2's Iron Crown Collection Event. The rules are self-explanatory: drop into a Battle Royale match all by your lonesome, with 60 legends total competing for bragging rights as well as some cool character- or win-specific badges.
In some ways, playing alone was a great way to test one's might in duels without relying on teammate assistance. However, the experimental LTM was a double-edged sword, revealing that some ability kits were simply stronger than others in 1v1s. For instance, Lifeline's "D.O.C. Heal Drone" made her a near-unkillable force, but her "Combat Revive" passive was rendered useless since there were no allies to resurrect. You can already see some…]]></summary>

This is the most we've seen of Bloodlines 2 since Paradox took the RPG from original developers Hardsuit Labs and handed it to The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs. The trailer shows 14 minutes of our vamp creeping about a warehouse with a pretty Dishonored-y combination of stealth and magical violence, showing very much why the sequel is now described as an "action RPG" rather than just "RPG".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you’ve been living under a rock, the monster-catching survival game Palworld is the hottest thing since sliced bread. As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.
An app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. 
[Warning]
January 31, 2024
Pocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. 
Palworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year. You can also watch us play Palworld from the beginning in this episode of Game Informer Live.]]></summary>

Alas, I have no review to lay at your feet, because the game booted once as soon as I got it, then didn't work for about five days, and for the rest of this week has booted at a ratio of about 1:8 of successful boot to attempts to boot. It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build. I can't speak to what your odds will be if you get it, but sure, if it works, you'll have a fun enough time, probably?

The thrill of adventure in a boundless playground tickles the imagination, something intimately familiar to players of Granblue Fantasy, a mobile/browser-based title that has been a hit internationally for over a decade. The original title resembles 16-bit turn-based RPGs like the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of old, leaving daydreams of grander scale and exploits a hopeful wish rather than an inevitable reality. With Granblue Fantasy: Relink, developer CyGames has an opportunity to explore a fantasy world of open skies and magic while…]]></summary>

Developer Rocksteady Studios' new live-service multiplayer shooter, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, went live for Deluxe Edition players on January 30. For those playing in regions like New Zealand, the game went live on January 29 here in the states (but it was January 30 for that region). Those first players were met with an unfortunate "story completion" bug that caused Rocksteady to take the game offline to fix. That fix took hours, leaving those who paid for the Deluxe Edition, which is $30 more than the standard edition, unable to play the game at all as Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice Leauge is an always-online game.

Or at least, that was the idea.
Like many an online-required live service game before, Suicide Squad's premium access release has been marred by technical bugs and glitches, the most severe of which saw players logging in to discover the main storyline already completed. I guess Rocksteady were serious about not wanting people to treat it like a "life commitment".

It taps into the same checklist clearing compulsion that saw me spend over 100 hours in both Odyssey's Ancient Greek archipelago and the Viking open world of Valhalla - only instead of chasing map icons that take you down weird sidequest rabbit holes that riff on Fenton the (sheep)dog, or gobbling up story events just so you can make googly eyes at every warm-blooded human in a ten mile radius, Palworld hooks you in with its enormous catalogue of base building tasks. Not catching the 100+ Pal monsters roaming around its mysterious islands, but crafting the perfect sweatshop to put them to work in. It's one of those, "I'll just add this furnace so I can craft some ingots that will let me make a cooking pot to level up my base, but wait, now I need some ore to make those ingots, and oh god, I've just spent seven hours doing not very much at all, have I?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster collection for Final Fantasies 1 through 6 back in 2021, I was overjoyed. For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.

Among the wildlife you'll murder are giant spiders, which might be a dealbreaker for some people, so it's just as well Nightingale comes with an arachnophobia mode which transforms those spiders into... large, winged balloons with teeth. It also replaces decorative, non-interactive, smaller spiders and scorpions found in the game's environments with ant models. If you have a phobia for ants or menacing balloons, you're out of luck, I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends, like all live-service titles, is no stranger to balancing updates. Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.

In a post on X, Bungie announced that Mass Effect cosmetics would be coming to their online shooter on February 13, just two weeks from now.

As mentioned in the X post above, the Alliance Requisition Bundle includes armor sets based on Garrus, Liara, and the protagonist, Commander Shepard. In addition to the bundle, which players will presumably have to purchase, three items will be available for free – the Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow.
Destiny 2 is currently gearing up for its next expansion, The Final Shape, which is set to launch later this year on June 4. It's supposed to usher in the conclusion of Destiny's story so far, so now's a good time to get caught up if you aren't already. Here's what we thought of their most recent expansions, The Witch Queen and Lightfall.  If you start in two weeks, you can do it while roleplaying as Garrus!

The upcoming "Kafkaesque" immersive sim gives you the simple goal of escaping a town within a few days, a task which is somewhat complicated by the fact that a Leviathan-sized Russian cop towers over the city, watching you. In a new dev blog, developers TallBoys explain more of how you might court the giant's approval (the term "fully fleshed dating-sim mechanic" features) or avoid it by sneaking about while he sleeps. You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.

As it readies to celebrate its five-year anniversary, Apex Legends is prepared to initiate some of its biggest changes yet, and we got a chance to speak with the team and play with its new modes and more.

Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like "I bet we WON'T find a match", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed. It is all-seeing and all, sadly, science.

Even though Mario is now known as the most iconic face in gaming, in his first appearance, 1981's Donkey Kong, he couldn't even get his name in the title. That was corrected in 2004 with the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a side-scrolling puzzle game designed to carry on the legacy of the classic arcade cabinet. Twenty years later, that outing has been reimagined for the Nintendo Switch, and Mario's rivalry with Donkey Kong – as well as the gameplay – holds up surprisingly well.
After the local toy store runs out of Mario toys, Donkey Kong goes on a rampage at the toy factory, leaving with a sack full of toys and Mario in hot pursuit. As Mario, you'll go through a series of levels w…]]></summary>

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.


So goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive.

Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Roya…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celeste celebrated its sixth anniversary this month, and developers Extremely OK Games have marked the occasion by releasing a free Nintendo 64 homage to their excellent platforming game over on Itch. Made in just "a week(ish)", Celeste 64: Fragments Of The Mountain channels the spirits of Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie as it tasks players with collecting dozens of strawberrys hidden around its snowy 3D landscape. It's well worth checking out if you've got a spare minute or so, though given how rock hard it is you may want to put aside a good hour or so if you want to truly master its controls and uncover every last secret.

Relatively few cards have been available at the launch RRP of £479, but today you can pick up the excellent Sapphire Pulse 16GB model for exactly that much rather than the £519.99 it debuted at. Is that a deal worthy of an RPS deals post? Sure, why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.
As a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make. And you know what? I'm good, actually. The Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster is good enough for me in this lifetime.

Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.
Which is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger. Yet all of it was moving of its own accord, as if I'd somehow stumbled into a child's dream.

This means that the famous "Steamboat Willie" cartoon is now free to copy, remix and monetize. More recent Mickey appearances remain protected, including the "Steamboat Silly" short which, confusingly, uses Steamboat Willie footage.

Eight Las Vegas residents were indicted in 2019 but while some pled guilty and were sentenced years ago, others are now heading to trial, 700 case filings later. With 19TB of data and 175,000 pages of print discovery weighing roughly a ton in paper form, this could be the most convoluted streaming piracy prosecution ever seen in the United States.

Since there is no way to run a report to provide the information requested, each potential case would need to be manually reviewed; too expensive, according to police.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
