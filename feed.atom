        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix delivered the first look at its animated Tomb Raider sequel series during a showcase today. It's brief, but undoubtedly looking faithful to the games. Lara Croft looks busy raiding tombs, using a bow, and looking cool in front of a fire I hope she didn't set by accident. It's the recent trilogy, so it's certainly possible.


It's clear the show will follow familiar Tomb Raider beats. Lara, played by Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter, Black Mirror), is shown delving into another ancient mystery. Heading deep into the earth, Lara is tracking down something apparently tied to a supernatural power. 


The Netflix series takes place after the recent Tomb Raider trilogy


Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft canonically takes place after the recent reboot trilogy. Following up on 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider, we'll likely witness Lara as she comes to terms with her troubled history. The trailer does offer a hint with what appears to be Lara reminiscing over a photo of old allies.




It's not much to go on, even though it's been two years since the show's announcement. The series is written by The Witcher Blood Origin's Tasha Huo, who's also the executive producer. Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is co-produced by Legendary Television, the studio behind The Expanse and Pacific Rim: The Black.


Today's announcement pairs with a handful of other first looks and reveals by the streaming company. Netflix premiered many more trailers, including those for Castlevania: Nocturne and Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix hosted a Drop 01 livestream today, taking the opportunity to tease the Devil May Cry animated series. Capcom's action series is coming to Netflix, with Castlevania producer Adi Shankar and Studio Mir (My Adventures with Superman) on board. 


While we don't get to see much of it, Dante looks pumped enough as he backflips, shoots, and dodges incoming attacks. Check out roughly five seconds of footage sandwiched between some menacing title cards below. 




Adi Shankar first revealed his acquisition of the Devil May Cry series rights back in November 2018. Two more seasons of Castlevania have made their way to fans since, and the Richter-centric Castlevania: Nocturne premieres tomorrow. As for Devil May Cry, its status still says "coming soon," so we'll have to wait to see exactly when it drops.  


Other folks involved in the series include writer Alex Larson, Seung Wook Lee of Studio Mir, and Devil May Cry sequel director Hideaki Itsuno. Itsuno already assured everyone he's "supervising it properly."


This party's gettin' crazy!


Netflix's Devil May Cry series isn't Dante's first animated spin. The Son of Sparda previously hit the screen in the appropriately titled Devil May Cry: The Animated Series anime. That one ran for 12 episodes in 2007 and came from Madhouse (One-Punch Man) and director Shin Itagaki (Berserk 2016). The series was written by Toshiki Inoue, known for anime like Death Note and live-action shows like Choujin Sentai Jetman. Whenever "soon" ends up being, we'll finally see how Dante holds up 16 years after his last animated outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 received casual confirmation that i a Performance Mode for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is on the way. Although Remedy Entertainment divulged plenty of story details for the upcoming horror game, specific performance details on consoles remained unknown. 


That changed recently when Communications Director at Remedy Thomas Puha confirmed a Performance Mode for the more powerful systems. Since "visuals and ambiance" were Remedy's priority, Puha stated that Alan Wake 2 aimed to be a 30fps experience. According to his Twitter post, this has since changed as the studio included a "solid" Performance Mode.




Puha noted more details would come later and clarified a few points in the comments. Among these include confirming the 30fps restriction didn't impact the PC version and that Performance Mode is being tweaked. Other comments asked about a potential 40fps mode for HDMI 2.1 compatible TVs and a physical release, but Puha didn't answer these. 


A glaring omission in the tweet is any mention of the Xbox Series S. With concessions, Microsoft's less powerful system and its beefier sibling have to run the same library. It wouldn't surprise me if the Series S version lacked a Performance Mode, but it may be disappointing for those who've yet to upgrade.


Alan Wake 2's focus on visuals over framerate isn't surprising either. Remedy Entertainment wears its cinematic inspirations on its sleeve, along with any influences it takes from gaming.


It's still great knowing 60fps is an option for many console owners at least. Hopefully, we will know if the Series S version also has a Performance Mode before Alan Wake 2 drops on October 27 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix announced in 2021 that it was developing an animated Tomb Raider series starring Lara Croft. Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. 
There's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. 
Check out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. 
In the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well. In terms of new Tomb Raider games, the first three PlayStation 1 titles are getting remastered next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed its October 2023 lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus members and, with it being the month of Halloween, the selections definitely fit the vibe. That's because PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dead Space spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, to their libraries alongside Weird West and the ultra-terrifying Farming Simulator 22. All three games can be added to libraries starting next week on Tuesday, October 3, and players have until Monday, November 6, to do so. 
Below, we've included snippets of what PlayStation has to say about each game alongside our reviews (when applicable): 
The Callisto Protocol 
Game Informer's review
Weird West

Farming Simulator 22
Before all three of these games go live for PlayStation Plus members next week, subscribers still have time to add this month's offerings – Saints Row, Black Desert: Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero – to their libraries. 
Are you going to play any of these next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things have finally settled down a bit for Destiny 2, only for Bungie to reveal a hard-hitting truth as part of the game's latest patch notes. As those who are in tune with Destiny's most prominent secret-hunting community, r/raidsecrets, will know, Guardians have been chasing after a mysterious third secret chest in the re-issued Crota's End raid. As per the patch notes for Destiny 2 update 7.2.0.5, though, there never was a third secret chest to begin with.


The patch notes themselves are mainly bog-standard: the sort of stuff you'd expect from a fairly minor Destiny 2 update. From a slight tweak to the loot pool of Crota's End to some PvP and PvE spawn changes, these are all good changes, albeit barely worth bringing up, considering just how much has been going on with Destiny 2 as of …]]></summary>

Initially announced back in 2021, developer Fossil Games and publisher Hound Picked Games have today revealed that the spooky 8-bit RPG Sunshine Manor will be creeping onto Switch on 6th October.
This one is said to be inspired by '80s horror movies and promises "thrills, chills & blood spills" — is there really anything else that you can ask for to kick off spooky season? You will play as Ada McReady, who agrees to spend the night in a famed haunted house (bad idea, by the way) with the ultimate goal of uncovering the mansion's mysteries and banishing the ghosts therein. Ah yes, there's also someone called 'The Shadow Man' who will be watching your every move — which isn't anything to worry about at all, right..?

Alongside this news, Poncle released a short teaser of what awaits survivors in the Whiteout update, and it looks like a frosty new take on the Vampire Survivors arcade action. Unlike the Tides of the Foscari DLC that was released earlier this year for $2, this Whiteout update will be free on all platforms where you can play Vampire Survivors. 
"It's the first trailer for Whiteout, the new free update we're working on (patch v1.7)," Poncle's announcement tweet reads. "Get ready for a frosty new stage, a new character, weapon, and more. Coming soon to all platforms."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is undeniably the biggest game of this year, if not of this entire console generation. However, in a display of irony, someone decided to show what this immense RPG would look like if it resembled something tiny.


Using a camera technique known as tilt-shifting, YouTuber Flurdeh gives us a view of Starfield that can only be described as micro. We see the likes of New Atlantis and Akila City looking like miniature versions of their original selves, as NPCs scurry about the place.




Flurdeh's channel is known for this tilt-shifting technique, changing the orientation and perspective of certain games in order to make them look like tiny facsimiles of themselves. You can see miniature Elden Ring, The Last of Us, Cyberpunk 2077, and Resident Evil 4. The creator says these videos stem from a love of game photography, with a view to showing the beautiful worlds within gaming.


My, what a big galaxy you have there


Since releasing earlier this month, Starfield has had more than its fair share of feedback. While generally regarded as a pretty fantastic sci-fi role-playing game, people are starting to see the cracks.


Fortunately, Todd Howard and his crew are working to keep things running smoothly. Update 1.7.33 rolled out recently, and a more significant patch is on the way.


Prior to release, head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the game would have the fewest bugs of any Bethesda release. While that does seem to be the case, it says something about the state of the current gaming climate where that's something to boast about.

Lego sets represent an ideal, if monstrously expensive, solution. I can build the thing without having to make all the constituent parts of it. I've recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don't actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall. But better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warfare has never been this cozy.
2023 has been a good year for tactics games on the Switch. Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot marked the return of two classic GBA games while Fire Emblem Engage brought the series's focus to its strategic roots. Chucklefish and Robotality's Wargroove 2 is the next SRPG joining the fray, and while its adorable pixel-art graphics might trick you into thinking it is a watered-down, kid-friendly version of the genre, it provides loads of depth to keep even the most battle-worn combatants engaged. It just manages to look cute as heck while doing it.
If you played 2019’s Wargroove — which was inspired by the original Advance Wars — then you’ll know exactly what to expect from the sequel. The world is the same, but new factions are battling it out for control of the strange relics leftover from a long-destroyed civilisation. There isn’t a recap of the events of the first game for new players, but Wargroove 2 does a good job of getting you up to speed without dragging things out too long. The campaign provides exactly the information you need from the first game, but if you want to get fully up to speed, there is a robust codex that you can read as a primer to help fill the gaps.

I got my hands on Alan Wake 2 during a recent preview event, letting me explore two slices of the game as the titular troubled author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. You can read about my experience with Alan’s segment here, but Saga’s side shows plenty of promise and narrative intrigue. 
My demo begins with Saga in the third chapter of her campaign. She arrives in the small town of Watery in search of the Clicker, a serial killer who seemingly has ties to the menacing Cult of the Tree. 
Investigations are Saga’s forte, and I’m tasked with probing Watery’s various …]]></summary>

Yes, a loading bar. Nintendo has now added a "progress bar" to the loading screen, so folks can see just how long it's taking to transition between stages and the hub. Nintendo reminds folks that transferring the game to the Switch's internal storage can "shorten" load times.


As for those aforementioned fixes, well, they're welcome, to say the least! Although I didn't encounter any of them during my full playthrough, treasures disappearing under specific circumstances is never good.


Interestingly enough, this patch also applies to the demo of Pikmin 4, wh…]]></summary>

This Complete Edition will hit PlayStation 5 next week on October 6. The PC version will be released in early 2024.
Horizon Forbidden West is the 2022 follow-up to 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn, and it was one of our favorite games of last year – read about why in Game Informer's review here. It hit both PS5 and PlayStation 4, but if you missed it last year, PlayStation and developer Guerrilla Games are making it easier to experience the full Forbidden West package on PS5 next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already know that Resident Evil Village is coming to Apple products this Halloween, so we're just waiting for a release date for Resident Evil 4. The recent remake is getting an iPhone/iPad port at some point this year, and you can pre-order it right now.


If you head over to Apple App Store, there is a release date that says RE4 is coming to the aforementioned mobile devices by December 31. However, this is just a placeholder, but we are expecting it to launch before the end of 2023.


Resident Evil 4 will be compatible with the iPhone 15 Max and Max Pro, as well as a number of iPad Air and iPad Pro models that feature the M1 chip.

So how much will it cost?


If you want to get the remake on any of the above devices, the App Store does list it as free. However, don't be deceived. There is a note on the site that says only a "limited part of the base game can be played for free." You will have to pay to unlock the full game. Essentially, it's sounds like it'll be free if you just want a demo of the game.


According to screenshots from VGC, the game will set you back £57.99 if you're in the UK. For US gamers, a report from Touch Arcade says it'll cost $59.99. You can also get the DLC, but of course that'll require additional money. 


With Separate Ways coming out recently, Resident Evil 4 is getting another look in. Will it be just as good on iPhone and iPad as it is on PC and console? Only time will tell.

Announced on Twitter, the 'Whiteout' update is set to add an all-new snow-themed stage, a fresh 'Antidote' and 'Glass Fandango' weapon (yes, I can hear you Glass Fandango), a mystery new character and, of course, a handful of new enemies and achievements to boot. Plenty to sink your teeth into there.

Today, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha confirmed on Twitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a Performance mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. 
Notably, Puha's tweet specifically names "Xbox Series X," and not the weaker Xbox Series S console. As it stands, it's unclear if the aforementioned Performance mode will come to Xbox Series S consoles; Game Informer has reached out to Remedy for confirmation and will update this story if we learn more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Winning several awards back in 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 is still held aloft as one of gaming's crowning achievements. Five years later, Rockstar's open-world tribute to the Wild West is still highly regarded for its gorgeous visuals. However, one person is working to make it look even better.


Currently a "work-in-progress," Razed Mods* (as spotted by PCGamesN) – real name Jamal – is bringing the world an even sleeker looking RDR2. Essentially, they've released a graphical overhaul for the Red Dead Redemption game, with a lot of enhancements to it.




In its current state, there are improvements to the weather, shadow distance, as well as tweaks to things like bloom render on lights, heat haze, plus more. It also supports the RedM multiplayer client.


How do you improve on near-perfection?


While a side-by-side comparison between Red Dead Redemption 2's original visuals and Jamal's mod would be useful, you can at least check out some of the screenshots from this overhauled version There's also the video above showing some of it off.


Despite Rockstar pretty much abandoning its critically acclaimed sequel, it's pulling in a lot of players to this day. The series itself isn't dead (ha!) yet, with the first Red Dead Redemption releasing to Switch and PS4 in August. Sadly, those versions weren't massively well-received, given that they were ports with a $50 price tag.


On top of that, many are still hopeful that a third installment will eventually see the light of day. No one can say for certain what the future holds for this franchise. Even if RDR3 does get made, it probably won't be until long after GTA 6 has come out. Whenever that's going to be.


*Sidenote: Depending on your resolution, you may need to full-screen (F11) your browser window in order to access the mod proper.

Gosh, I do love patch notes for massive RPGs. Even the relatively minor ones read like failed alchemical experiments plucked from a mage's workshop, like the one you find behind [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] in Baldur's Gate 3 Act [REDACTED].

We all ought to know by now that Nintendo hasn't always been a video game company. Originally founded in 1889 as a playing card company, it's naturally been through several substantial evolutions to get to where it is today.
The same can also be said of Nintendo's logo. While the majority of us have likely only ever been exposed to a slight variation of the current design, the logo has been through a great number of changes since the late 19th century.

It introduces Dualshock 4 and DualSense controller support alongside a host of changes to enemies, the execution of the game’s Fable Arts or gear-specific special moves, item drop rates and the duration of stagger windows. The overarching aim seems to be to make the game easier, and as I’m sure you’re expecting, a few Lies of P fans - and, it turns out, RPS staffers - are ticked off about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Sonic Superstars inching closer to its launch, there's plenty for fans of the blue hedgehog to get excited about. The upcoming game retains a 2D sidescroller look, though it uses 3D assets instead of the pixel art style of Sonic Mania. In the lead-up to the game, we've gotten a few gameplay videos and a few music snippets. 


More recently, Sega has laid the groundwork for the plot through prologues. The first came in the form of a cute animated video featuring Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, and Amy. We also see the main villains of Sonic Superstars - Dr. Eggman, Fang the Hunter, and Trip. 




The latest prologue comes in the form of a comic that will be released in parts. Sega released the first part on social media, and it starts with Dr. Eggman and Fang looking over Northstar Island. Dr. Eggman is on the hunt for beasts and treasures, and he sends Fang off to do his bidding. 


Fang sets off with the intention of double-crossing Dr. Eggman, but things go south when strange sounds emerge from the trees. You'll have to wait for the next part to find out what happens to the devious duo.

There's plenty of Sonic comics to explore


Over the decades, there have been plenty of Sonic comics released. This year, fans were allowed to create and share their own comics thanks to the Fast Friends Forever campaign. Visit the franchise's social media channels, and you can view some of these comics which focus on Sonic and his friends. 




Sonic Superstars is set to release on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment is gearing up to release Alan Wake 2 which adopts the survival horror genre and features two protagonists. In the lead-up to the game's launch, Remedy has been sharing information about Wake's next adventure. We know that the other protagonist is a detective named Saga Anderson and that we'll be heading back to Bright Falls for her segment of the story. 


Recently, Remedy spoke to IGN and revealed a bit more about the Remedy Connected Universe and how it will play out in the upcoming game. Fans of the studio will know that while games did occasionally feature Easter eggs referencing other titles, Control was the first time the RCU was formally established and it was confirmed that Jesse Faden and Wake exist in the same world.


According to Remedy's Sam Lake, the Federal Bureau of Control will play a "key role" in Alan Wake 2, though he is careful to not share too many details. We may have already seen hints of the FBC in a prior gameplay trailer which featured Ahti, who is an FBC janitor in Control. The entire process is quite exciting to Lake who is enjoying the "very tasty opportunities of referring to and doing callbacks and adding extra layers of meaning, building this kind of a web."


As previously established, the Remedy Connected Universe consists only of IPs owned by Remedy. Consequently, Alan Wake and Control are part of the universe, but Max Payne and Quantum Break aren't. This doesn't mean that the studio's other games won't get winks and nods. For instance, Wake's Alex Casey novels are inspired by Max Payne. In Alan Wake 2, the titular Alex Casey (voiced by James McCaffrey) will serve as a central character. 


To find out more about how Faden and Wake's worlds collide, you'll have to wait until the game launches on October 27 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Players will explore a new planet while being hunted by Mux, a mysterious new antagonist voiced by Gabourey Sidibe best known for her roles in Precious and American Horror Story.



"We really leaned into horror with High On Knife, so it only made sense to launch it around Halloween. The DLC brings more goop, nastier body horror, creepier bosses, and all kinds of strange new stuff to the world we established with High On Life."
-Mike Fridley, Squanch Games Studio Director



High On Knife will certainly look to capitalize on the success of High On Life which has surpassed over 7.5 million unique players worldwide since its release less than a year ago. The comical title was the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of 2022 and the biggest single-player game launch on Game Pass at the time.


It will be interesting to see if Squanch can pull off the spooky horror with comedy combination. If so there's certainly an audience for it.


The High On Knife DLC for High on Life releases on October 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite typically runs events or random mixups every few weeks, and this current content drop includes a fan favorite. Star Wars has been heavily factoring into Fortnite's event schedule for a while, and now Ahsoka Tano, star of Clone Wars/Rebels and her recent titular show, is a playable character/skin.




As Epic details in their Ahsoka debut blog post, Ahsoka Tano will not only be available as a cosmetic character; Star Wars gameplay elements from recent seasons will make a return as well. You'll be able to speak to holograms of Ahsoka around the island, which will in turn provide "Jedi training," resulting in abilities like faster sprints, double jumps, and force push (similar to Darth Maul and Obi-Wan NPCs in the past). These elements will be a part of Fortnite proper until version 26.30, so keep that in mind.


At 9AM ET on September 26 the outfit unlocked, which also includes a loading screen, banner icon, pickaxe, spray, back bling, [weapon] wrap, emote, and emoticon. You'll unlock the aforementioned items through the Chapter 4 Season 4 Battle Pass quests, which will be locked in through the end of the season (which is on November 3, 2023).


Epic also reminds folks that there was just a recent hotfix, which has a few welcome changes:



Zyg and Choppy's Ray Gun charges and fires faster. 


TNTina's Ka-Boom Bow charges, reloads, and recharges faster. 


Slurp Juice drops with less quantity, chug wisely! 


Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle has increased damage and faster fire rate. 


The Foundation's MK-Seven Assault Rifle has reduced damage and a slightly slower fire rate. 


Sticky Grenade Launcher has a slower fire rate and a longer reload time. We've added a cooldown when swapping between two Launchers.  


Gunnar’s Stinger SMG deals slightly more damage per bullet with decreased vertical recoil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Start flexing those puzzle-solving muscles, because The Talos Principle II has a release date. Devolver Digital and Croteam announced plans to bring the next entry to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 2, 2023. You can see some of this brain-bending at work in the new trailer, which shows more first-person puzzling.  




It's been nearly a decade since the debut of the first The Talos Principle game, which launched in 2014. It's a brilliant puzzler that can be simultaneously empowering and infuriating. That's a succinct way of saying it succeeded in a lot of the stumping it set out to do in the first place. The sequel promises new puzzle mechanics, secrets, and "the biggest, weirdest world Croteam has ever built." That in and of itself should be enough of a hook for most. 


Aye, Robot


That isn't to say there won't be plenty of returning puzzle styles for those who played the first game. It should be interesting to see how Croteam turns those familiar quandaries on their head this time. In addition to a very specific type of thinkin' cap, the devs want to get you stroking your philosopher's chin with more existential pontifications. The Talos Principle II aims for a "richer storyline" with questions about humanity, the cosmos, and whatever else will have you saying, "Dude. Whoa." 


The Talos Principle II is priced at $29.99, and you can get 10 percent off with a pre-order via Steam and Epic Games Store. There's an even bigger discount on the original for a limited time. From now until October 3, you can grab The Talos Principle and the Road to Gehenna DLC for 90 percent off on Steam.

Most importantly, it also means the return of Ada Wong as a playable character. She’s someone who’s even more confident than Leon is, using her charisma and spy gadgets to come out on top. When she isn't wooing everyone around her, Ada swings around like Spider-Man with her grappling hook, making investigations a breeze with her contact lens scanner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DON’T NOD, developer of Life is Strange, Vampyr, and Tell Me Why has announced that its latest title, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, will be delayed. Initially, the studio planned a November 7, 2023 release date.


The new date for Banishers pushes it to February 13, 2024, and the delay includes all platforms. According to DON'T NOD, it's a strategic move to avoid a busy season of heavy hitters.


“We have decided to postpone the release of this new franchise by three months, as the market is experiencing an intense release cycle for AAA titles on PC and consoles at the end of the year,” said Oskar Guilbert, CEO of DON’T NOD, and John Bert, managing director of Focus Entertainment, in a joint statement. “We are convinced that a commercial release of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden during a less saturated period will give it the attention it deserves."


Last July, DON'T NOD announced its initial release date for Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden’s along with the first trailer. In the game, we “play as Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, lovers and Banishers—ghost-hunters who vowed to protect the living from the threat of lingering ghosts and specters,” according to a trailer description. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2's official release date is November 3, as announced by the game's Twitter page on Tuesday. You can now wishlist the platform fighter on Steam, and digital pre-orders will go live in October.




This out-of-the-blue announcement for the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 release date does not mention any special editions. However, we know the game's content-packed already. The sequel adds a new roguelike single-player campaign: you'll be fighting Danny Phantom villain Vlad Plasmius as you explore the Nickelodeon universe. Furthermore, the Steam page shows bosses like SpongeBob Squarepants' King Jellyfish, and the presentation overall looks inspired by the World of Light mode from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. 


On the same Steam page, publisher GameMill Entertainment claims "Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2’s roster is better than ever, with even more variety in how each unique character plays," Some characters like Helga seem to be cut while newer entrants like Squidward and Jimmy Neutron take center stage. Fo those that made it, every character is getting a revamped moveset in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. The visuals and audio have also been improved with "new animations, modes, stages, mechanics, [and] taunts." Similar to Super Smash Bros. Brawl, this follow-up introduces new supers for each character as well.


These new features may improve the review score for the game. The original currently has a middling 63-71 Metacritic rating, based on the platform.


Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 heads for the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 3.

Or, maybe, go find an old retro cabinet to while away the hours in Night City. There's still a secret or two to find in Cyberpunk, it seems.


It was already confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 was getting another arcade game in 2.0, dubbed "Trauma Drama," alongside the previously added Roach Race. But hidden away in a remote corner of the map is another game: a retro boomer shooter called "Arasaka Tower 3D."


This retro cabinet, hidden out in the far-reaches of Cyberpunk's world, is not just a neat easter egg. It's also, potentially, a step towards unraveling an ARG surrounding CDPR's work, in and out of Night City. But let's not get ahead of ourselves—first,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fair dinkum, mate.
Back when the 3D mascot was in its prime in the early noughties, Aussie developer Krome Studios' Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was going up against big shots like Mario, Sonic, and Crash Bandicoot thanks to the backing of third-party powerhouse Electronic Arts and, eventually, Call of Duty publisher Activision. TY would fall out of favour and the studio behind him went through some ups and downs, but Krome bounced back the following decade and in more recent years it has remastered the first two 3D versions of TY via Kickstarter, both available on Switch.
Now the studio is back with the lesser known 2D outing, TY the Tasmanian Tiger 4: Bush Rescue Returns. TY 4 originally made its debut in 2013 on Windows and other devices and now it has been revived for Nintendo Switch with improved graphics and music, new voiceovers, and remastered extended cut scenes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary game designer Chris Metzen has officially returned to Blizzard in a full-time role. He will now serve as the Executive Creative Director of the Warcraft universe with a main focus on World of Warcraft in particular. According to the announcement, Metzen will be at the upcoming BlizzCon 2023 to share what's next for the Warcraft universe. At previous BlizzCon's Metzen was often the one to reveal new expansions, which fans have surely missed.


Tweet via @Warcraft Twitter


For Warcraft fans, this is amazing news. Metzen was instrumental in creating the overall story, world-building, and creative design of the Warcraft universe. He created the original story concept and script of the popular RTS Warcraft 3. With World of Warcraft he continued to work on the script and story of the MMORPG while also creating artwork and doing voice work for the title. He's well known for doing the voice of Thrall, the main Orc character in Warcraft.


Metzen left Blizzard back in 2016, only to return as a Creative Advisor at the end of last year. It appears that since then his role has grown from advisor to full-time Executive Creative Director.


World of Warcraft's story has been a bit all over the place as of late, so hopefully Metzen can get it back on the right path. Blizzard is expected to reveal its new expansion at BlizzCon 2023 in early November. Surely Metzen has had a big role in shaping that expansion and will more than likely be the one to announce it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poncle, the developers of Vampire Survivors, has revealed the Chilling Update, which is set to drop “in a few weeks” according to a trailer posted by the developer. 




How to unlock the Chilling Update content


The trailer — which is less than a minute in length — asks the viewer if they’re “tired of working the dairy plant,” and if so, they should “cool down in whiteout.” This update unlocks a brand new overworld to play Vampire Survivors in; the overworld looks just like a winter wonderland, only with a lot more autonomous, floating skulls and ghouls than I’d care for. Based on the trailer, the new overworld can be unlocked by collecting 20 Orologians.


Also included in this update is a new weapon, the Glass Fandango, which is “stronger with movement, Orologians, and against frozen enemies,” a new relic, the Antidote, that “allows [the player] to buy the Defang PowerUp,” and a new character, She-Moon, who can be unlocked by surviving 20 minutes in the new overworld.


It was not confirmed when specifically this update would be released, but it was said it’d be within a few weeks from the trailer’s posting on September 26. The Chilling Update serves as Vampire Survivors’ version 1.7.0. Version 1.6 added a local co-op mode, an option to disable blood, font, and border customization options, and the ability to integrate the game with Twitch for Steam versions only.

If that sounds like a bit too much for you to handle, CD Projekt has also offered an easy way to say "no, thank you" and leave it, for good.


As it turns out, Phantom Liberty has a dialogue option that will let you ditch its campaign entirely. If the goings get tough and you no longer wish to take part in the story, you can walk away, albeit after one extra confirmation. It happens pretty early on in the expansion, but just a heads up that we'll be talking about the mission content in "Lucretia, My Reflection."

More specifically, Banishers will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 13, 2024. 
As for why, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert says the team is aiming for a "less saturated period" of video game releases, alluding to the swath of games releasing in the coming weeks, including next month's Assassin's Creed Mirage, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, and more (and that's just some of what's releasing in October, which then leads right into November).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the Covert Dock 2 and ShadowCast 2.
We were already very fond of the Genki: Covert Dock when it was released back in 2020. This portable Switch dock made gaming on the go that bit easier, and was later compacted into an even tinier model in 2021. Now, developer Human Things is back with a new Kickstarter campaign, introducing an improved portable dock, a new way to play Switch games on your iPad or laptop, and a handy device for streaming and content creation.
Dubbed The Alpine Collection, this latest Kickstarter introduces upgraded models to some of Human Things' most popular creations: the Covert Dock 2, ShadowCast 2 and ShadowCast 2 Pro. Beginning with the most Switch-y of the newly-announced products, the Covert Dock 2 is a two-in-one charger and dock much like the Genki portable predecessors, though this one packs in 50% more power than the original model while still being 10x smaller than the standard Switch dock and charger. It also comes with 4K support, which is a nice touch for boosting that resolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate "Metascore" as a kind of "magic". The FAQ cheekily invites you to "peek behind the curtain", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the "weighting" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.
You could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt RED has issued an apology, after it was discovered the Ukrainian localization of Cyberpunk 2077 includes a remarkably comprehensive array of anti-Russian references. These range from prominently featured graffiti all the way to niche terminology that will largely be unfamiliar to anyone not from Ukraine or the surrounding countries.


These sentiments are notably not prevalent throughout all versions of Cyberpunk 2077. These were found in the Ukrainian localization of Cyberpunk 2077, which recently went live alongside the 2.0 update. The job was given to the Ukrainian company SBT Localization, per the game's credits. It's also worth noting that CDPR has been vocal about the war in the past, taking actions that include halting sales in Russia.

The Payday series has always entertained using a mixture of competing gameplay mechanics. Going from an engaging yet sometimes confusing heist-based simulation to a chaotic Left 4 Dead-inspired shooter, each title presented a wildly shifting mission structure that encouraged cooperative play. Payday 3 doesn't reinvent the wheel, as it offers many of the same core concepts found in the previous games. That said, some smart design choices and its fresh coat of paint help elevate it above this popular series' previous iterations.

It's painted with hues of desert orange and "Arabian Nights" blue skies, something intentional, according to artistic director Jean-Luc Sala.

In case you missed it, the Ukrainian script and menu localisation currently includes a number of antagonistic references to Russians and to the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine. One dialogue line refers to a particular bandit group as "rusnia", and there's photo mode menu text for a squatting character that translates as "like a Russian". There's also lore text that apparently riffs on Ukrainian government rhetoric during the war, and a piece of in-game wallart that alludes to the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all of the Souls series marketing blitzes, it's easy to forget that yes, From Software produced and released Sekiro, and it ruled. Well, it's cleaned up quite a bit and managed to achieve the milestone of 10 million units sold worldwide as of September 26, 2023.


Here's the full announcement directly from the game's official website, roughly translated to English:



"From its release in March 2019 to today, we have received tremendous support from everyone, and we have now surpassed 10 million units sold worldwide. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who played this work."




I hope that in 20 years, people remember Sekiro


The last website update for Sekiro was back in May of 2023 when From Software made folks aware that there would be temporary online maintenance. Since then it's quietly lived on in the hearts of many; including folks who wistfully still haven't beaten that final boss yet.


It's not in the headlines nearly as often as Elden Ring, which is a cultural phenomenon at this point, and it's arguably less accessible. But it's also one of my favorite games of this generation, packed to the brim with tense boss fights, interesting locales, and a kickass action system.


You can find a used copy for roughly $30, and I highly recommend you give it a chance if you have a penchant for action games. There are a lot of similarities to From Software's Souls moneymaker to be sure, but it's also one of the most unique games they've crafted to date, and it shows almost immediately.

The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.



Ever Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's first DLC, Phantom Liberty, officially releases today. Since the game has been regarded favorably (thanks to post-launch updates), many have been looking forward to new content. However, some may not be impressed by what developer CD Projekt Red has done in preparation.


In a post on Twitter, the studio announced that, in time for Phantom Liberty's launch, the team has decided to disable mods for Cyberpunk 2077. 




According to the post, this is to "prevent issues with the game that are caused by mods before they receive their update from the modding community." It's an act of precaution and not a permanent move. At the time of writing, there's no indication of when the studio will re-enable them.


CDPR keeps a watchful eye


While some will understand CDPR's decision, others will be a little peeved that mods temporarily lost their official support. For now, at least.


This is also not the first time the Polish developer has maintained a presence in the modding community. Back in December 2022, the studio posted on its forum regarding the then-upcoming "next-gen" release of The Witcher 3.


It seemed that many were concerned that mods would not work correctly for the upgraded version of the RPG. However, CDPR released a list of popular mods that it had personally checked, outlining which ones would be compatible with the update.


Hopefully, it won't be long before the developer does turn mods on again for Cyberpunk 2077. A lot of PC gamers have grown accustomed to playing improved, non-vanilla versions of games, so they won't want to stick with the base experience for too long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spooky season is not far now and many will be looking towards the horror genre for what's coming up. In light of this, Outlast Trials studio Red Barrels has announced some exciting things happening with its twisted co-op game.


The studio dropped a couple of posts recently on Twitter/X. One of them mentions the new edition of the Murkoff Collections comic. This is then followed by the announcement that a new update for The Outlast Trials is imminent.




While details are scarce at the minute, Red Barrels did wish to respond to questions by outlining some of the things you can look forward to. We'll be seeing a new trial map, some additional variators and cosmetics, as well as a new mini-game for the lobby. Plus more.


Console editions on the way


If that wasn't enough, a further post says the team has been "working on getting Trials on PS5, Xbox S/X, and older gen (PS4/Xbox One)", and PC crossplay. It's looking like the studio is looking to achieve this by early 2024.


As for the Outlast Trials update, we're not quite sure when that's going to start rolling out. However, given the time of year, it wouldn't be too surprising to see it aim for a Halloween launch or thereabouts.


The developer also says that the company has now hit 50 employees, which means there may be some more goodies on the way for the early access of the newest Outlast entry. Hopefully, we'll have more word on that in the near future.

And when that single, solitary good memory is connected to someone you love, it’s almost impossible to rip yourself away from that pocket of happiness and face reality. It’s even more complicated when…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere feels like the cancelled shooter PS2 adaptation of an incredibly short-lived Image Comics horror series from the mid-90s, leaked by a disgruntled developer over Google Drive more than a decade after the fact. It’s something that would have had a six episode animated series, broadcast out of order at 1am. It’s a testament to that moment in pop culture where the coolest thing imaginable was a tortured guy in a trenchcoat, holding a gun in each hand and fighting monsters. Whether you regard this aesthetic with respect or disgust will help you determine whether there’s anything here for you.

After being announced for Hong Kong last month, it has today been revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, will be landing a full international physical release on 3rd November.
The news was shared to Twitter by Nintendo, revealing that the physical copy will contain the current version of the game (with The Teal Mask DLC) and will require an update once the second part of the DLC, The Indigo Disk, is released — remember, we still don't have a release for that one yet. So, a physical DLC cart... without all of the DLC on it? Makes sense, we suppose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vibrant and violent volume.
A few years ago, Nippon Ichi produced Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, a new entry in the long-running series that aimed to shake up series conventions by introducing auto-battling and transitioning to a 3D art style. Not all the changes it brought were positively received, but fortunately, the game sold well enough to not only keep the lights on at the company but to also justify the development of a proper successor to address those criticisms.
Director Shunsuke Minowa said that one of the team's main goals with Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless was to go with a “back to basics” approach, and that was absolutely the right call. Disgaea 7 feels like the ultimate distillation of the Disgaea experience, successfully merging the innovations of 6 with many of the traditions of earlier games, all while throwing in some worthwhile new ideas of its own. It’s an incredibly compelling new entry, and we can’t recommend it enough to any strategy RPG fans out there.

Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!


The game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.

Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.
Or at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles "an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.

Marcus Stewart has played it (which you can read about here) and even showcased some combat gameplay (which you can watch here). Now, the footage below is set in the vibrant grasslands near the city of Kalm and showcases Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's not-quite-open-world gameplay but pretty close to open-world gameplay. We also get to see some Chocobo-riding, including a glimpse at how Red XIII, a quadruped animal, mounts the iconic Final Fantasy bird.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3's matchmaking servers were a mess in its first week. What went wrong? The maker of the game, Starbreeze Studios, blames an “unforeseen error” for the issues, and says it’s looking at ways to make the “always online” multiplayer shooter “less dependent on online services.”

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minekos-night-market-review"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, "What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island." To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.
Instead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.
But this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, "perhaps the best expansion pack ever made." Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.
Hello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.

My favourite used to be "sunsetting", aka cancelling a live service game, aka "we dragged the servers outside and smashed them with bats, gangland style". But now there's a new front-runner, "simmering". You know what's simmering? Quantic Dream's Star Wars: Eclipse, that's what. "Can I say it still exists? Because it exists," the developer's vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse has revealed in a new interview from this year's Tokyo Game Show. "It's just not ready. It's simmering." Hmm.

The authentic replica of the world wide web circa 1999 was originally designed to be little more than ornate level select screens in a stylish endless runner-style game, for example, providing extra context for your adventures pursuing "outlaws on the Hypnospace Highway". 
Games change during development, of course, and it’s not unusual for once substantial ideas to be left on the cutting room floor. But seeing as Hypnospace Outlaw is our pick for the RPS Game Club this month, I wanted to reach out to the game’s creator Jay Tholen to ask some questions about these unlikely origins, its influences and its lasting legacy. What happened to the Hypnospace Highway? And what comes next for the world of Hypnospace?

It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.
I asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.

Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. 
As for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. 
Here's Platinum's statement:

September 25, 2023
And here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: 
However, I feel this outcome is for the best.
September 25, 2023
Before co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. 
Kamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.
While waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101. Read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review after that and then read our review of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Do you think Kamiya will stay in game development? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. 


Pawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So much of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is spent jumping between Hyrule’s landscape and the floating islands above it that I can’t fathom somehow beating the game without traversing both the sky regions and Hyrule proper. But that’s exactly what one player miraculously managed to pull off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke
Part 3 - Staff Meeting

It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.
It's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.

Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.

Or, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky "RockyNoHands" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.

Hard lines against hard drive installations are new to PC games, but it was only a couple of weeks ago when Starfield showed the dangers of crossing them. Broken audio, regular freeze-ups, load times so long you could measure them with a calendar...  an SSD really is the only way to play Starfield, and it sounded like Cyberpunk 2077 would follow suit. "We advise against running the game on an HDD (or on a SD card on Steam Deck) due to lower bandwidth which may cause new content to not stream properly," reads CD Projekt Red’s 2.0 patch notes. That’s us told.

Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it's a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn't really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it's rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they'll be complaining about things the whole time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it's coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 
And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

        <updated>2023-09-22T12:30:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has "identified limited residual concerns with the new deal" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA "has provisionally concluded should address these issues." The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

Wētā Workshop and Private Division have announced Tales of the Shire, a "heart-warming" experience that will release on PC in 2024. I've got a live action trailer for you, in which a young person doodles pictures of Hobbits, while seated at a desk intriguingly strewn with modern appliances such as laptops and assorted Lord of the Rings paraphernalia. The book she's doodling in contains sketches of celebrated locations such as the Green Dragon pub in Bywater, and there are drawings of dolls, Hobbit-holes and onions. Take a peek!

The CMA blocked the deal in April this year over concerns that it would "alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market", and might lead "to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come". Microsoft attempted to woo the regulator by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard game cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft, and while the CMA have "limited residual concerns", they've largely accepted Microsoft's modifications.

Alas, it comes too late for the Wood Elf Druid I rolled during my first try at the 1.0 version. I wanted her to look like a sort of Kung Fu Galadriel, with cool tattoos and aerodynamic scars, but she emerged from the character creator looking like she'd been mugged by a packet of demon crayons. I've left my active character, a High Elf Sorceress, safely tattoo-less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love creative tools in videogames, from drawing Worms levels in Deluxe Paint to optimising r_speeds in Half-Life maps to using Minecraft worlds to generate 3D renders. That love has only been amplified by having a kid whose first instinct in any game is to create his own character, unit, level - whatever is available.

The best creative games inspire that creativity by having some innate flavour of their own, though. Some personality that inspires you to lean in, or nudge it in some other direction. By comparison, the new trailer for Everywhere, seems like metaversal porridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.
The RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. 
In our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices in less than two months on November 16. This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. 
In the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. 
Check out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. 
Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. 
While waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the biggest games of the year, but it launched with its fair share of bugs. Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed "to ensure thorough testing." This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.
While we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. 
With Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!

Even though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.]]></summary>

It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: "2002's Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck."
Yet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven't played much of it yet, I'm confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a "post-modern future", designer Ben Friedman tells me. 
The twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on.

CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. "It was a rough few years but there's finally celebration and closure (for me at least)," posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride.

Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox's 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we'll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game's November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox's PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer's Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.
Tucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. "To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game" she says. "I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used." She explains that "a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that "you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures."


It sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I'm piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 "no possibility left unpossible" choice-and-consequence train continues with the revelation that, if you break up with a lover in the game, you can slowly repair the relationship and spark a bit of your old chemistry. This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy "loyalty" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the first time (check out my full impressions here), I then spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi, producer Yoshinori Kitase, and creative director Tetsuya Nomura to seek answers to some burning questions. That includes how much narrative ground Rebirth covers, the decision behind splitting it between two discs, and if there’s any form of data transfer between Remake and Rebirth.
How Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick. It’s especially impressive since Square developed and released the PlayStation 5-ex…]]></summary>

Final Fantasy VII Remake felt like the realization of an impossible dream when it launched in 2020. Not only did it feel willed into existence after years of fan requests, but it largely lived up to sky-high expectations based on its generally positive reception. Tack on a good story expansion with the Yuffie-focused Intermission, and the series is riding a wave of momentum into its second chapter, Rebirth. To learn how the sequel is shaping up, I visited Square Enix’s Los Angeles studio to play two slices of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: a flashback sequence of the ill-fated Mt. Nibel mission and an open-world segment …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evil Dead: The Game, the PvP co-op shooter based on the bloody comedy-horror movie series, survived till dawn - but not much longer. 16 months after its release, its developers are putting a stop to any new content for the multiplayer game. You’ll still be able to keep playing for the time being, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prior to joining RPS and coming into a possession of an Actual Contemporary Gaming PC, I did all my gaming on a plucky Erazer laptop from circa 2014. The old warhorse has certainly had some adventures, to the point that it isn't really a laptop anymore but a hovering debris cloud of plastic and metal, constellated by strips of sellotape, from which a moving picture may be hesitantly conjured by means of screamed insults and the careful deployment of desk fans. 


Among the sicker jokes I've played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I can run Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they're pretty dang reasonable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.
The other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.
I played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.


The anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.
Fae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's triumph was that it offered a sprawling story, dozens of hours long, which cohered around just a small number of themes. Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.
V doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?

Since its disastrous launch in 2020, developer CD Projekt Red has delivered critical updates to Cyberpunk 2077 to align it more closely to the original vision, but Phantom Liberty, coupled with the free Update 2.0, is its biggest yet. This new expansion trades in the high-octane mercenary vibes of Cyberpunk 2077 for a more subdued spy thriller, and offers a well-made trove of new ways to experience Night City. The expansion features a great cast of personalities, all well-performed, even if some are underused. Interacting wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spencer Yan's My Work Is Not Yet Done is a narrative-driven investigative horror game that combines elements of the survival and simulation genres with a plot exploring "the imbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness", to quote the project's Github page. It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to "to discern the most viable 'truth' behind both Avery's mission and the signal itself". 


It's all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I've seen and heard about Yan's game, but I don't think I've ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today's efforts will address this. For you see, what I'd like to call your attention to right now is the game's complex recreation of shitting.

        <updated>2023-09-20T14:06:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
First up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.


Some details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.

Alongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.


Arguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.
Alongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their "failure" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer "production scale" to attract and retain customers. 


In turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, "AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises", while relying on "rented" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game has ceased, developer Saber Interactive has announced. The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.
In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, "It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced." You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-19T21:44:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share "the real plans" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.

'Luckily', what appears to be the platform's web portal can be located in seconds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to leaked documents, Microsoft are/were remastering Oblivion and Fallout 3. This is boring. The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they're going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a draining day's reportage upon the thoroughly alien doings of vast corporate publishers, I like nothing better than to flee, blabbing and weeping, into the arms of a micro-RPG. Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not "Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen" or "wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke" but "person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court earlier this year to get its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally greenlit. Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a "ZeniMax Management Forecast" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

September 19, 2023
As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. 
It's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.
For more, read about how Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games in 2020, and then check out the refreshed Xbox Series X/S and new Xbox controller coming next year, according to internal Microsoft documents.

As usual, specific documents, emails, and more were sealed away from the public and press during court proceedings.

Xbox and Microsoft spent a lot of time this year in courts working to get its purchase of Activision Blizzard legally approved, and many documents were sealed away from the public and press during these proceedings. However, various unseen documents from those court proceedings have leaked. One email reveals Xbox head Phil Spencer was considering an acquisition of Mario maker Nintendo and Mortal Kombat 1 publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now known as Warner Bros.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce an affiliate partnership with ZOOM-Platform, a supplier of DRM-free games. If you use a link from this website (or from our Wiki), the ScummVM project will receive a small amount of money to be used for web hosting and other expenses.
Any purchases from ZOOM-Platform qualify, but we especially encourage you to check out games supported by ScummVM, such as the Syberia 1, 2, Galador,  Obsidian as well as 18 titles from the Living Books series. In total, we counted 25 games supported by ScummVM, and this list is growing.
We will keep an up-to-date list of the games available from this platform on our Wiki and have added an affiliate link on the sidebar here.
