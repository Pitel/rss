The re-launch of the World of Warcraft expansion that literally changed the world is now available in closed beta. You can experience all the fun of a dragon-fueled apocalypse now by signing up at Blizzard's portal.


Cataclysm was a huge expansion, and WoW's most monumental undertaking. The entirety of the main world was rebuilt for new stories, quests, locations and more. The expansion also saw the introduction of the Worgen and Goblins as playable races, the Archeology skill, and transmogrification. The ability to change your gear's appearance continues to be one of the most important features for style-savvy players.

These optional quests award in more experience points and Requisition Slips, so they're worth tracking down. Here's how to find them.


A good way to find out what missions include Secondary Objectives is by looking for the light blue icons on the maps before you begin. From my experience, Secondary Objectives start appearing at Medium difficulty and beyond. Look for blue icons that can look something like crashed pods with smoke or beakers. These icons indicate a Secondary Objective, and their location on the map can usually be seen before the mission starts.

This fancy new armor set helps you dress like one of Azeroth's greatest enemies: The Nathrezim. It's available now for $20 in the in-game store. 


The set comes with two fashionable colors to best suit your most diabolical transmog. Both variants, the Shadowbane and Venombane sets, give you the whole usual getup  — helm, shoulderpads, breeches, wings and all.

We recently learned a lot more about The Dreadlords in the previous WoW expansion, Shadowlands. What we thought was another group within The Burning Legion turned out to be a faction from the realm of death. They've managed to infiltrate virtually every organization in the known cosmos. At least, according to a report of theirs. 


These vampire-adjacent monsters are responsible for some of the most terrible atrocities on Azeroth. They guided the invasion of The Burning Legion, the creation of The Lich King, and even The Jailer's attempt to remake reality. The Unseen Guests, as they're also known, have been a thorn in players' sides since WarCraft III. 


While it might be easy to think we've put an end to their sprawling, chaotic schemes; celebrations may be premature. For what better way to hide from your enemies than by having them dress like you? A truly cunning idea, is it not? Beware what you wear...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interrogating enemies in Call of Duty: Warzone is a useful tactic to locate the enemy team. Like using Caveira in Rainbow Six: Siege, a downed player can be interrogated to reveal their teammates' location. However, right now, the mechanic is causing a game-breaking bug that's probably not worth the risk. Better to hold off and find those enemy locations the old fashioned way.


Interrogating in Warzone can prevent you from swapping weapons


According to a recent post from Call of Duty Updates on Twitter, an issue is under investigation where interrogating downed enemy players can prevent you from swapping weapons. The developer Trello board says the bug is active in Battle Royale, Resurgence, Plunder, and Lockdown game modes. The investigation began on Thursday, March 7.




Until the developers provide an update on the status of this bug, it might be worth not interrogating anyone. Swapping weapons is a rather important ability for many reasons. As such, the few seconds of locating an enemy's teammates probably isn't worth the risk. Especially in Battle Royale, where you can't exactly just die and reset very easily. 


In other game modes, like Resurgence, there are better methods of pinging enemies on your radar. For those unaware, killing an enemy in Resurgence game modes automatically pings the rest of their team on your radar for a few seconds. As such, it's incredibly useful for players who move around and hunt for kills a lot. Flying around Fortune's Keep in the castle or another close-quarters map is much easier to survive if you know where your dead enemies' friends are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the sad passing of Dragon Ball Z creator Akira Toriyama, Final Fantasy XIV players have come together across the world to pay tribute to a hero and legend of the anime sphere. Since news of Toriyama's passing broke, players have gathered outside the Pugilist’s guild in Ul’dah, many dressed as some of the creator's most beloved characters.


Although best known for creating the foundational world of Dragon Ball Z, Toriyama was also renowned for his work on much-loved RPGs. From his character designs in Chrono Trigger to striking designs in Dragon Quest, Toriyama touched artists and fans within the world of anime, manga, and video games.

It doesn’t matter which server you play on, it’s hard to miss the gathering of players in Ul’dah, decked out in cosplay in homages to the life’s works of Toriyama. There’s no end to the Goku outfits, and hundreds of people donning the Slime Crown and Thug’s Mug glamour items, inspired by Dragon Quest, and rewarded during the Breaking Brick Mountains event last held in 2021. 


As they always do in sad times like these, players are utilising the Wanderer’s Campfire minion to light the streets of Ul’dah, and they’re likely to remain in their chosen spot for hours, or even days, in remembrance of Toriyama and all he gave to the world during his life. 




It’s not the first time Final Fantasy XIV players have come together in honor of a treasured artist; back in 2021, the community came together after the death of Kentaro Miura, creator of the infamous Manga Berserk. Thousands of Dark Knights on every server lined the streets of Ul’dah in his memory, just as we’re seeing them do today. The community also gathered again for one of their own, Stephen Critchlow, who voiced Count Edmont de Fortemps in the Heavensward expansion.

The news recently came out of the official Helldivers 2 Discord channel. According to the community manager, who goes by Spitz on the channel, Arrowhead has listened to "concerns over the last few days regarding enemy spawns, enemy armor, and the ability to kill these enemies." In response, the dev is preparing to make changes in a "future hotfix" so that the high-level fights feel a bit more manageable.

Well, allow us both to be reminded of something from over a decade ago, because the Watch Dogs film is still apparently A Thing. It’s more of A Thing now, too, because it has actual names attached rather than just a corporation’s vague “excitement” about licensing out its IP.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Infogrames became Atari, which has links to Ziggurat Games, which works with publisher Tommo. So, the rights have been swirling around this big bucket.


That’s maybe not important. What is important is that someone at Ziggurat or Poppy Works identified it as fertile ground for a revival, even though the original wasn’t entirely acclaimed. Then, Poppy Works discarded basically everything about Slave Zero and somehow created something that pays respect to the original but is a completely original concept.


The result is fascinating. At a glance, you wouldn’t link Slave Zero X with its supposed progenitor. It’s an entirely new thing. And yet, somehow, it still adds value to …]]></summary>

It's impossible to overstate the impact of Akira Toriyama, the legendary manga artist and character designer who has been working in the manga industry since 1978. His death at 68 years old has thousands around the world mourning his loss.
Toriyama was, to me, comfort on sick days or after school. I'd watch episodes of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z on Toonami. His art in the manga and on the show captured a sort of electric energy that felt entirely unique to him; big hair, sharp lines, expressive eyes, and bold colours — sometimes blended softly, other times (particularly in his later work) big blocks of green, gold, and orange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various outlets are reporting that the influential creator of Dragon Ball and character designer for games like the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger, Akira Toriyama, died on March 1 of a subdural hematoma.


You’d be hard-pressed to find a game developer in Japan who wasn’t influenced by Toriyama in some way. His work on Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball has pervaded the culture there and even found popularity in the West. Because of this recognition, he was tapped to design the characters for Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in North America) which itself became a cultural phenomenon in its home country.


As Streets of Rage and Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro put it on Twitter, “Toriyama’s work, with its unique art style, captivating characters, and warm, comforting stories, really made an impact on us kids.”


From there, Toriyama continued to work on the Dragon Quest series throughout his life. He later assisted with the creation of Chrono Trigger, often cited as one of the best RPGs ever made. He also lent his character design to the Tobal series and Blue Dragon. April will see the release of the adaptation of his manga, Sand Land.


This comes as quite a shock. Many people, including myself and the rest of Destructoid, are deeply saddened by this. But while Akira Toriyama may have passed too soon, his influence and his works will live on for a long, long time.

The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Disney Dreamlight Valley Premium Shop is no stranger to controversy and one of the latest additions, the Small Pink Wings, have caused a bit of backlash within the player community and renewed a call for an item preview function. 


Ever since it was introduced back in February 2023, the Premium Shop has offered players a chance to get their hands on unique items or items from past Star Path events. From the beginning, there was discourse among players due to the price of items, but it has gone on to become a popular addition to the game. 


However, the Premium Store is now a year old and it's still missing one much-desired feature — the ability to preview items before purchasing. While clothing items are displayed on a mannequin, wings aren’t. This is the main issue that has caused the latest controversy.

There have been four different varieties of wings that have been featured as possible purchases in the Premium Store (shown above). Judging from the photos and the price of the latest set, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the Small Pink Wings would be a similar size to the other three. 


Sadly, you’d be wrong and it’s this fact that has caused upset within the Dreamlight Valley community. 




As it turns out, the wings are absolutely tiny and players feel as though they’ve been misled with the Premium Shop image, understandably, and the argument for some form of preview function has become all the stronger as a result.

On the plus side, these wings have sparked a slew of jokes involving Heimlich from A Bug’s Life, after he gains his rather tiny wings and turns into a ‘beautiful butterfly’. Reddit comments are filled with people sharing images and gifs of the underrated character, causing others to state that they now actually want the wings in light of the comparison.

If you're working to escort the goblin to the end, we'll explain how to save Sazza in BG3. 


Act 1 - Find Sazza in the Emerald Grove


At the beginning of the game, Sazza is captive in the Makeshift Prison in the back of the Emerald Grove. She’s locked inside a cage, being threatened by a young tiefling named Arka. Arka wants revenge because Sazza and the other goblins killed her brother. Here you’ve got an opportunity to intervene.

It's a motorbike. They have turned Miraidon into a motorbike. Now, we know what you're thinking, surely a project like this runs the risk of looking a bit naff. Won't it very obviously be a bike with various parts stuck to it? Oh no, dear friends. These are Toyota engineers that we are talking about here, and it looks wicked.

That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

Matt Kain Lewandowski, one of the developers of 2013’s Fist Puncher, has stated on Steam Discussions, “So far they have said no with the reason being that they made the universal decision not to transfer the games back to the original studios and do not have the resources to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to think we should bury Vampire: The Masquerade back in the forsaken graveyard where it was originally dug up, or at least banish the toothy reprobate back to its pen & paper castle. I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.
The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.

March 8, 2024
Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.]]></summary>

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

The LEGO Animal Crossing sets released in March 2024 feature a range of different minifigures and island elements bringing back memories of 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the form of everyone's favourite plastic bricks.
As we run through each of the sets to see which one is best, here we're looking at Isabelle's House Visit — a particularly interesting example as it's the only one to contain the series' inimitable mayoral assistance and admin extraordinaire, the loyal and lovely Isabelle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since releasing to early access over ten years ago, Rust has become one of the most famous online survival games in the current era. I say "famous" when I really mean "infamous" because, as anyone who's played the game knows, it's hard as frick. What we really need is a tutorial.


Ta-da! As of now, the latest patch for Rust has started rolling out which, low and behold, implements a Tutorial Island, perfect for getting to grips with the fundamentals. According to a post over on Steam, the island offers a way of adding a "safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players."




It also says that all players will be prompted to run through the tutorial "when they first spawn this month," but you can decline the offer. Here's what you'll learn:



Basic movement


Crafting


Building bases


Upgrading bases


Respawning


Basic combat


Resources


Looting containers


Cooking


Using Furnaces


Workbenches


Using a vehicle



No mention of how to cope with being screamed at by aggressive teens


That's probably one of the biggest things to come out of this update. But there's also another huge improvement that's been made to Rust in the guise of better night lighting.


The update notes go on to say that to combat "gamma hacking" from players, the studio has added a "Nightlight feature." Essentially, this is a shader that illuminates the immediate area in front of you at nighttime, "mimicking the effect of natural moon light."


In short: you should now be able to see much better in the dark. It's still going to be pretty dark, though, so don't expect to be able to confidently run through the inky blackness with nary a care in the world. This is Rust, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've kind of become used to the idea of monthly subscriptions for our gaming needs. But if even that's too much for you, Nvidia has now made it possible to utilize its cloud gaming service on a daily basis.


As reported by Videocardz, you can now purchase a Day Pass for GeForce NOW, which gives you access to Nvidia's servers, powered by the RTX 4000-series graphics cards. It comes in two flavors as well: Priority and Ultimate, similar to the monthly memberships.




As for what you get, well, you'll be entitled to 24-hour access to Team Green's cloud, which includes all the usual benefits of a typical subscription, but without actually having to subscribe for a month or beyond.


But not 24-hour gaming


It should be said that you won't get to play your games through GeForce NOW for the full 24 hours. Depending on which tier you opt for, you'll get either six or eight hours of actual game time, but you'll have access to the servers for the entire day.


According to the sign-up page on Nvidia's website, you can pay $3.99 for the Priority Day Pass or $7.99 for Ultimate. The latter is said to have "exclusive access" to the RTX 4080 servers. You'll also benefit from up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.


Oh, but if you want to try before you buy, the report from Videocardz says there's an option to get a free hour-long session, but I couldn't see where you would sign up for that. It also comes with ads, because we are, in actuality, living in an episode of Black Mirror (what a cool reference).

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…]]></summary>

The industry is in a sad state now, so if you want to cheer yourself up with a dose of Adam Jensen, you can pick up Mankind Divided for free next week.


That's one of the titles being given away over on Epic Games Store. The other is an indie puzzle from 2013 called The Bridge. Both will be available between March 14 and March 21. They will be replacing the sci-fi combat game Astro Duel 2.




While it may not be the most lauded Deus Ex entry out there, it's still a nice little freebie for those who have yet to play it.


You can't resist all that sincere moping


Things are so up in the air for Eidos-Montreal's celebrated series. With voice actor Elias Toufexis being told to stop talking so much about Adam Jensen, there's definitely a sense that we won't ever get to see a follow-up to Mankind Divided.


It's a story we're all getting sick of hearing, no doubt. The video game industry is in dire straits at the moment, as huge publishers issue redundancies and studio closures. Eidos was one of those recently, which effectively put a nail in the Deus Ex coffin. Honestly, it's hard to keep up with the amount of job losses that have occurred these past 12 months or so.


While we won't likely get to see a new Deus Ex entry, maybe take some comfort in being able to get a copy of the latest installment for free. Sorry, didn't mean to bring the mood down there.

When we first got wind that Expeditions: A MudRunner Game was on its way to Nintendo Switch, we gotta admit, we were a little bit surprised. This new entry in Saber Interactive's superb off-road sim series takes the whole mud-running malarkey to a new level, with larger maps, loads more fine details, and improved physics over its well-regarded predecessors. How on earth was this big, modern, physics-heavy driving game going to run in handheld mode on a seven-year-old console?
Well, as it turns out, not without some fairly notable issues. However, we will say straight off the bat that if this is your only way to play, or you're just a big fan of the previous games, you'll likely be able to overlook most of the roadblocks. But let's quickly run through the overall deal with what's different between this new entry and the sublime Snowrunner first.

EA has made these classics and more, and for some reason The Saboteur, available on Steam for the first time. You can see the full list of games here. I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, "beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, "real meat". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

Where to start The Winged Knight


First, to even meet Ochlys, you'll need to head to Treyes Village to start The Winged Knight side quest. You can take the path south from Thulust Harbor and head east at the fork, past Fort Mainteneaut, to find the battle.


After speaking with Ochlys, you'll need to help her reclaim Rondmort Church from some local bandits, whose forces you might remember. It's an Enemy Level 4 fight, which shouldn't be too tough.

Blizzard's free-to-play shooter Overwatch 2 hasn't exactly blown up like the original game but it has delivered some new ideas (and collabs). The latest one is another anime-inspired crossover and this time it adds new cosmetics based on the legendary '90s anime Cowboy Bebop.
Yes, Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, and the rest of the crew are kind of joining Overwatch 2 as skins. Here's the official announcement via social media and you can check out the trailer which recreates the iconic anime intro.

Beginning back in 2015, io games made a huge debut and were some of the most popular titles on the market all the way through 2018, with even PewDiePie once declaring an io game to be his "new favorite game." Now that’s some popularity.


Nowadays, there are still loads of active io games for players to enjoy or just try out. There are way too many to list, but there are a few that are worth checking out. Here are the eight best io games you can play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While no live-action film of Final Fantasy VII has been announced, it's not hard to imagine Hollywood doesn't at least have an overly eager eye on it. Depending on perspective, that's either a threat or delight to muse over, especially when you consider Square Enix isn't too shy to flirt with the big screen  — looking at you, Spirits Within and Advent Children. 


For better or for worse, I often find myself musing over ideal actors for the inevitable, like Zelda or Shadow. So, in case Hollywood goes for it, I'm shouting out my choices now. In honor of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's launch, here are my picks for a live-action FF7 cast that I think, if made now, would be worthy of such a classic legacy.

Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the 'tank' enemies in Helldivers 2, only one is an actual freakin' tank. The Annihilator Tank is the Automaton answer to the age-old question of "Where did that hole in my chest come from?" Good thing it's not too tough to kill a Tank in Helldivers 2.


Granted, taking one out does require you to not be standing in front of it. Much like other vehicles (such as Helldiver 2's own Hulk) the Annihilator Tank comes with a weak point that's a video game classic. You need to find the big, glowing spot and shoot at it until the machine lies in pieces. That's easier said than done, usually, but with the right firepower and some quick footwork you too can beat the Tank.

        <updated>2024-03-07T20:04:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that they’re releasing a slew of their older games onto Steam. All of them were available elsewhere, but finally, they’re available on the PC’s biggest digital storefront.


A lot of these are from Bullfrog, one of the many studios that EA shuttered, but there’s also the Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection, which features some games from Westwood, another studio that EA shuttered.


Here’s the list:



Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection


SimCity 3000 Unlimited


Populous


Populous 2: Trials of the Olympic Gods


Populous: The Beginning


Dungeon Keeper Gold


Dungeon Keeper 2


Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack


The Saboteur



That’s a coincidence! I’ve been working on something involving Command & Conquer, and while doing my research, discovered The Ultimate Collection. I saw that it was available on the “EA App” (formerly Origin), and that’s as far as I went in that direction because I’m not installing the EA App. Now I don’t have to! Phew. But that’s neat since I just discovered its existence today while I was looking up if you could still buy Command & Conquer Renegade.


Aside from that, everything else was available on GOG, and I already own most of them on that list, but not Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection.


If it sounds like I’m being flippant, it’s because EA is one of the worst companies when it comes to preserving their back catalog. SimCity 3000 is here, but do you know what isn’t available? The original SimCity. Most of what they made back in the ‘80s and ‘90s might as well not exist to them.


But credit where it’s due. You can now buy the listed EA games on Steam. That’s not nothing. Maybe they're going to pay better respect to their old classics, but I'll believe it when I see it.


The games are available right now, and they're all discounted quite considerably for a limited time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV has a long list of recurring seasonal events that happen (mostly) around the same time every year. For 2024, two of these, Little Ladies’ Day and Hatching-tide, will combine into one celebration, beginning on March 14 and ending on April 1.


Usually, the bulk of Little Ladies’ Day occurs in March, while Hatching-tide celebrates in April. Rather than splitting them up this year, we’re getting one combined mega event adding differing decorations across Eorzea between its three city-states. The only bummer is we get only one (admittedly pretty fun) reward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

Your shopping basket from the Steam store is now shared between devices, so if you put something in there on browser you can finish it up on your Steam Deck. But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite: Chapter 5 was a huge launch for the long-running battle royale developed by Epic Games. Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.
As Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. 
Prepare thyselves, mere mortals!

Unfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. 
In the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month. After that, read about how Disney and Epic Games are partnering up to create a games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My kingdom for a unicorn.
How do you follow up a game like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? Before that ambitious, phenomenal sci-fi adventure, developer Vanillaware found its niche in creating rich, beautiful-looking worlds with a magical, medieval twist. Sometimes it was traditional Western fantasy, while others it jumped back to Edo Japan. Unicorn Overlord marks the developer’s return to the former, taking place in a fantasy realm overtaken by an evil lord. That sounds like the exact opposite of 13 Sentinels’ winding plot, but Unicorn Overlord is ambitious in an entirely different way. It’s also absolutely brilliant, effortlessly blending multiple systems to create a wonderful tactical RPG with a twist.
At the start of the game, you witness the fall of the Kingdom of Cornia thanks to a revolt led by General Valmore. At the same time, the young prince Alain flees the kingdom with the Holy Knight Josef, to ensure the bloodline survives. The revolt, however, is successful, and the Zenioran Army rises up and gradually overtakes all five nations of Valmore. Ten years later, Alain returns to build a liberation army to take back his kingdom and restore order to the continent of Fevrith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-season-2-launches-next-week-with-new-cutting-edge-warbond"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T14:57:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new "Cutting Edge" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with "high-voltage vibes," giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. 
Warbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new "Acquisitions" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. 
Check out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: 


Within this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with "wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts." The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the "end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'"
In terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. 
You can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. 

Elsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. 
Cutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. 
The trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

Announced at Gamescom 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening hasn't had much in the way of news since its reveal. That promising trailer gave us a basic idea of what the game, which is a small part of a multimedia franchise, is going for, but beyond the basic premise laid out by the series, we haven't learned anything new about the game in quite some time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.  First announced in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.
A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  


Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass). You can read our review of the first Frostpunk here.]]></summary>

Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About eight months ago, Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.
The action is defined as "dancing swords," but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.


Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares finally regained sole control of The Sinking City in January, after years of dispute, and have wasted no time in now revealing a sequel, with an upcoming Kickstarter campaign for a "safety net", coming in 2025. The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last July, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XIV, the critically acclaimed and long-running MMORPG, would be coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. 
This news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. 


The timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 
Before Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game. 
Are you going to play Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox later this month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unknown 9: Awakening has been silent since its reveal at Gamescom 2020, but today’s Xbox Partner Preview saw it reemerge with its first gameplay trailer and release window.


The game is set within the popular sci-fi media franchise and is a third-person adventure starring Haroona (played by The Witcher's Anya Chalotra), a woman gifted with mysterious abilities. The game's official website has the following synopsis: 
That includes, from what we can tell, sucking people's souls out of their bodies and telepathically blasting enemies through destructible environments. Haroona can also pull enemies, control their minds, and more. The game also features parkour-style platforming across an Indian city. 
Unknown 9: Awakening is coming this summer to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by "himself," I mean multiple versions of himself.
Jan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the "what if" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. 


The Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima is finally riding to PC. The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. 
In terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. 


Developer Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.
Per the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” 
Ghost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. 
Ghost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.]]></summary>

Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service shooter from Batman: Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios, debuted last month to mixed reviews from both critics and fans alike. However, Rocksteady is looking to pump something new into the game with the release of Joker as a playable character. 
Teased back in January as an Elseworlds version of the popular villain, this Joker, notably not the same voiced by Mark Hamill in the Arkham games, goes live on March 28. Rocksteady revealed this release date the same day its parent company, Warner Bros., announced it is doubling down on live-service and free-to-play games. 


Warner Bros. CEO of global streaming and games JB Perrette explained at a Morgan Stanley conference, "We think the opportunity for us, which again, this i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead have released a new Helldivers 2 update - patch 01.000.100 - which designer Alex K describes as "the first round in a never-ending series of balance changes". The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead's pretty straightforward golden rule that "each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has released the first major patch for Helldivers 2, and it adds additional environmental challenges to the game alongside mission changes, updates to weaponry, bug fixes, and more. It's live as of this morning and arrives less than a day after the team teased the incoming arrival of mechs as usable vehicles for players. 
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Minor Patch 01.000.100 is the addition of new environmental challenges that appear at random on many of the game's various planets. Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, "and many more." The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area. Eradicate missions now require more kills and enemies spawn mo…]]></summary>

Look out for parts 2 and 3 over the coming week. During the hands-on, I also spent 45 minutes in the shoes of another advanced Dragon's Dogma 2 class, the Magic - sorry, Magick Archer. You might remember this vocation from the original Dragon's Dogma; then as now, it combines relatively straightforward bow combat with various breeds of enchanted ammunition, for a surprisingly technical skillset that is enjoyable to faff around with.

I haven't played an Outlast game since reviewing the second numbered game and having excitable opinions about its portrayal of the moon. I'll be honest, I'd assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game's mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation.

He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chivalry 2's latest update is called "Duel of the Fêtes", which makes me wish I could drop the chef's kiss emoji into RPS posts. It gets even better, though. Aside from adding new maps, "skill based team balancing", and quality-of-life improvements, the update also adds unofficial server support, for players who want to tweak game rules and party like it's 1999.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

I visited Capcom last month to play the game for about three hours, and you can read Game Informer's Dragon's Dogma 2 preview impressions here, but I also spoke to director Hideaki Itsuno about how the game will run on consoles. 
Sitting in Capcom's San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon's Dogma 2's framerate. Specifically, he revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Dragon's Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate. It was an interesting announcement, considering "uncapped framerate" is typically something I associate with PCs – not the PlayS…]]></summary>

No Rest for the Wicked (NRftW) graces Game Informer's cover this month, and it marks a dramatic shift for Moon Studios for several reasons. For one, it's an action RPG from the team that gave us two of the best platformers/Metroidvanias ever in Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. You can read all about what the game entails in our digital issue, which is available now. But another huge shift is that NRftW will first launch into Steam Early Access on April 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

The 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.
Players take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.]]></summary>

Titled "The Last Ronin," Eastman and Laird envisioned it as the final Turtles story set 30 years in the future. While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.
The story is bleak and gritty, establishing a universe where the four beloved brothers have been taken out one by one. It's set in an alterna…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. 
That's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.


As you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. 
It's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. 
For more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series. After that, check out the first Fallout TV series trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades, the critically acclaimed roguelite from developer Supergiant Games, is coming to Netflix later this month. It will be available to all subscribers on iOS devices starting March 19, but you can pre-register right now.
While Netflix might sound like an odd fit for a game that's available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Netflix says this mobile version of Hades features 60 FPS gameplay, redesigned menus and interfaces, fully customizable on-screen controls, cloud saves, achievements, and offline play. 
Check out a new trailer for Hades on Netflix for yourself below: 


We really enjoyed Hades here at Game Informer, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in our review for being "a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships," amongst other things like its high-octane action gameplay. 
Hades coming to Netflix might be the perfect excuse to replay the game ahead of the Early Access debut of its sequel, Hades II, which is set to begin this year. 
Hades joins a growing list of great games available now or soon on Netflix, like Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, Katana Zero, Death's Door, and Braid: Anniversary Edition.

A joint motion for a $2.4m judgment in favor of Nintendo was filed on Monday. The cost to the emulation scene appear in a proposed injunction.

That anatomically tricky relationship is enticing by itself, but even if those retro action platformers just register as historical relics in your memory, Berserk Boy does enough that’s new and interesting that it doesn’t need to rely on aping its inspirations. My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you dislike getting stabbed in the back in first-person games, you might not like Voin. If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we're ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.
I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.
Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Little Knight Games has revealed Mira and the Legend of the Djinns, an upcoming 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania inspired by Moroccan mythology. Set to be published by Assemble Entertainment, which is publishing Endzone 2 this spring, Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC via Steam this year. 
In classic Metroidvania fashion, you can expect plenty of enemies and secrets to discover with a variety of tools, items, and abilities as you progress through the game. Plus, unlockable moves add flair to your exploration and combat encounters as you attempt to uncover the secret of the last Djinn. 
Check out Mira and the Legend of the Djinns for yourself below:
 

"Not every ancient treasure belongs in a museum, as treasure hunter Yuba discovers within the debris of the kingdom of Fallen Amazgesh," a press release reads. "There, Yuba meets a Djinn named Mira, a race long lost to the world of man, and the pair team up together to escape the ruins and discover Mira's lost memories."
Little Knight Games says the game's combat "emphasizes fluidity and experimentation, and allows you to switch between weapons and elemental modes on the fly." The Germany-based studio says it's a team of seven people from different countries around the world and that Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is a love letter to Metroidvanias, "featuring a world based on the Moroccan and Amazigh mythology." 

"Morocco has a rich culture filled with fantasy stories about Djinns and mysterious creatures," the press release reads. "With the team's diverse background, they wanted to show this in their very first game." 
Other Mira and the Legend of the Djinns features include a sprawling map full of secrets, fast action combat, and a mystery to keep you pushing forward. 
Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC this year. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer's top 10 Metroidvanias to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a man in my thirties, the idea of going to a club is exhausting to think about nowadays, let alone do. I was thinking about this as I watched the new trailer for Synduality: Echo of Ada, a mech extraction shooter I would probably gladly play instead of going out - but is nevertheless very exhausting to watch itself, at least in this glimpse. You and I will be able to give its open beta a go while avoiding any social engagements later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/04/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-launches-in-steam-early-access-this-summer"/>
        <updated>2024-03-04T17:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Greedfall 2: The Dying World reveals that the game is launching into Early Access via Steam sometime this summer. The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.
Premiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. 


Spiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: 


Once its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of the first Greedfall here.]]></summary>

With some unbelievable heat surrounding the Dune franchise following last weekend's release of the critically acclaimed Dune: Part Two, Conan Exiles developer Funcom provided a huge update for its anticipated MMO, Dune: Awakening, during a livestreamed Dune Direct today. Last week, Funcom and Warner Bros. invited me to the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California for an advance Dune Direct and Dune: Part Two screening. While I entered this event lukewarm on the Dune franchise, I emerged enamored with the film and excited about the promises being made by the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.
Cataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.


The game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. 
Cataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don’t fully understand the rancor with which the RTX 4070 Ti is often regarded. Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the easy layup might have been a third game in the amazing Ori series, developer Moon Studios' next game after 2020's Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an isometric action-RPG called No Rest For The Wicked. It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so. 
In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre.

Last month, I traveled to Vienna, Austria, with Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to visit Ori series developer Moon Studios. It was here that Marcus spoke to Mahler and his fellow Moon co-founder and technical director Gennadiy Korol about No Rest For The Wicked, the action RPG adorning Issue 365 of Game Informer magazine, as you might have just learned if you watched Wicked Inside today. 
I watched Marcus play the game for a couple of hours, and while I was there to film for cover story purposes, I'd be lying if I said I didn’t watch with som…]]></summary>

This dark fantasy action RPG combines influences from a variety of genres, from ARPGs like Diablo to the difficulty and thoughtful combat of Dark Souls, to the town-building of Animal Crossing, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Ori And The Blind Forest developers Moon Studios announced that their next game would be a top-down, online action RPG, my initial reaction was, 'Heck yes, sign me the hell up for this Souls-y, Diablo-y hack and slash.' Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight's Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a 'Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.' It's definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there's still something about No Rest For The Wicked that's left me quietly captivated.

Each page listed Arrowhead as the developer, and PlayStation as the publisher, along with big discounts of 50-75% off to tempt players into buying the cheap version instead of the real one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. 
The subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we released our first candidate for version 14! That means we will start to focus on fixing the remaining bugs and stop adding new features. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.]]></summary>

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects
