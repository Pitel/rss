        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance classic Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online on August 8/9, 2024. This is a great excuse for those of us who never had a chance to play this spin-off series to dive in like it's launch day. 


Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team was the last Pokémon game to be released for the Game Boy Advance. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team was its counterpart on the Nintendo DS, but the only differences outside of hardware were six exclusive Pokémon on each version. The game focuses on the turn-based combat elements of the series and pits you against groups of enemy Pokémon as you work your way through randomized dungeons, trying to complete jobs for clients and rescue those trapped inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite has many named and unnamed locations, from well-known landmarks to random gas stations and small spots at the edges of the map. However, while Davy Jones' Locker sounds like another unnamed area, getting here is easier than you think but requires some sacrifice.


How to visit Davy Jones' Locker in Fortnite X Pirates event


Visiting Davy Jones' Locker means being eliminated during your Fortnite match. It doesn't matter how you do it as long as your character dies somehow. While having a player defeat you is the easiest way, NPCs, fall damage, or even fire from campfires will do the trick.

It also doesn't matter which location you choose to eliminate yourself and visit Davy Jones' locker. If you want to finish it quickly, you can drop out of the Battle Bus, land at the nearest landmark, and wait for another player to appear. Alternatively, you can focus on other quests and naturally obtain this one if you don't get a Victory Royale. How you do this is entirely up to you. Personally, I chose to drop down and let someone knock me out with their pickaxes before starting another match a few minutes later.


Once your character dies, you'll officially visit Davy Jones' locker and receive Cursed Gold toward the Cursed Sails Battle Pass. You'll also gain progress toward finishing all eight Pirate Code Eight quests to receive your last map piece and unlock Captain Jack Sparrow's ship. It's up to you whether you want to hop back into a match and show off your glider or take a break if you just finished a long game.

Well, we weren't expecting this. After crunching some of the numbers from Nintendo's latest financial report, it turns out that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - which was a launch game in 2017, mind - actually sold better than its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, during Q1 of FY2025 (cheers, Mr. Jon Cartwright).
Now, for a sequel to sell fewer copies than its predecessor over its lifetime isn't paritcularly surprising (in fact, it's usually the norm), but for the first game to sell more over a period of three months in 2024? That's wild.

This is a known bug that developer Arrowhead Game Studios has already acknowledged in recent patch notes for the game, and it just so happens that chasing the Personal Order will help all players smash the final few hours of the current Major Order.

File this one in a box labelled "Huh, makes sense", because Nintendo has confirmed that its selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose by 2.4% year-on-year during its latest financial report.
"Okay, so?", you might ask, and it's a fair question. While certainly not a particularly noteworthy announcement on its own, Nintendo has confirmed that one of the main reasons for this is due to a rise in research and development costs. As we know, the successor to the Switch will be revealed at some point before the end of FY2025, so it's not unreasonable to assume that the company is now all-in on development for the new console.

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

There are no surprises here if you've been keeping up with release date news, but following the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, this is the first one of these on which Metroid Prime 4 has shaken its dreaded TBA label in the last seven years — and it's still scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025.

The game has been in development for years and is itself a resurrection of an even older title, but the work is far from over. 


Through 2024, Predecessor has been released in beta for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and Omeda Studios has introduced Brawl and Ranked Modes into the roster for players to enjoy. Even before then, though, starting in 2020, the game has been in the works, with new heroes and skins being added to the roster on a regular basis. Having played it for a while now, I believe its the link to the community that's given this game the momentum to reach this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a deluge of criticism (including from yours truly), World of Warcraft's Radiant Echoes pre-patch event is getting some big tweaks today. In a blogpost over on the forums, community manager Kaivax breaks down the changes.


Less waiting, more rewards


Long story short, the event is going to have less waiting around and, when you do complete it, you'll get more rewards. 


Before the patch, you'd have to show up at the beginning of the 90-minute window to complete the event within a rotating zone. Once this event was finished (which took anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes), you were out of luck if you missed it. With this patch, the event will continuously refresh throughout the entire duration. In the active zone, scenarios will appear and, after defeating them, a boss will spawn. Rinse and repeat.

If you do want to farm the lesser mobs that appeared in the zone once the event was over, those will be available in the other, "inactive" zones. 


Furthermore, rewards are being increased, and the weekly quests that rewarded 1,500 Residual Memories will now be daily across your account (to cut down on the urge to run the event across multiple alts). With bosses spawning so much more quickly and dropping the same loot, you should be getting a lot more event gear from drops alone, so those memories can be put to good use buying the event's mounts and pets. 


Leave it to Blizzard to outdate my blogpost in just 24 hours, but as Kaivax says, "we hear you!"

Developer IO Interactive added the Mystery of the Unicorns challenge to Hitman World of Assassination as part of the game's Summer 2024 update. It gives you a new reason to revisit Dartmoor, though not as you might first think. Instead, this challenge is firmly locked to The Dartmoor Garden Show mission. This is the game's only main Escalation Mission type, which is a staple part of the story and not a smaller chunk of a standard location because it contains a completely revamped version of the main map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That one guy in the group always doodling a dingus will be pleased, as the Jackbox Naughty Pack seems to be encouraging it this time around with three new games. Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, and Let Me Finish will likely leave us in stitches when they launch sometime in September. 




Yes, you will be Fakin' It All Night Long!


The social deduction game Fakin' It returns in this All Night Long version as the faker tries to blend in as the participants tell the truth and perform a secret task. The idea is that you have to become the best liar in your group. This naughty version of the game will have new categories and an all-new remote play mode. 


Dirty Drawful marks a return to the popular Jackbox game over the years but adds spicier prompts into the equation. Described as "both terrible and titillating," to the point in which an undo button has been added to the game. If you haven't played Drawful before, it's like Pictionary, but everyone tries to fool other players into choosing their guess/answer. If another player chooses your option instead of the real answer, you'll get points.

The only new game added to the Jackbox Naughty Pack is Let Me Finish. It's a debate-style presentation game, in which you're answering odd questions, such as which "meat" most likely wants to be called daddy, for example. In the trailer, seven different meat sticks are shown and you have to choose which one is the daddiest. Another question asks, "How does this avocado get aroused?" I've got nothing, but surely know someone that'll bring the snark. 


The Jackbox Naughty Pack is heading to consoles and PC sometime in September 2024 for $21.69. Ahhh, we see what you did there, Jackbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC is now live in EA FC 24, and you can obtain the special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


The Japanese winger has had a sensational season for Real Sociedad, and he's now part of the FUTTIES promo. All players have equal chances to get the item by completing the SBC. Let's take a look at what you need to do to get the card, and if you should invest your resources at all. 


EA FC 24 Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC is really easy to complete. It has just two tasks, and the conditions are pretty reasonable as well. There are plenty of different ways to get the fodder required to complete this SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 88



Task 2 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 89



EA FC 24 Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here are the solutions for completing the Takefusa Kubo FUTTIES SBC. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Mapi Leon: 89


Cucho Hernandez TOTS: 88


Victor Osimhen: 88


Mikel Oyarzabal: 88


Marie Katoto: 88


Jan Oblak: 88


Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87


Lina Magull: 87


Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87


Lea Schuller: 86



Task 2 - LaLiga



Erling Haaland: 91


Bremer TOTS: 91


Marc Andre Ter Stegen: 89


Ruben Dias: 89


Rodri: 89


Sandra Panos: 87


Lena Oberdorf: 87


Ewa Pajor: 87


Gregor Kobel: 87


Martin Odegaard: 87


Lautaro Martinez: 87



This Kubo item is pretty interesting for its price. It has four good playstyles, and the H/M work rate is pretty decent. The presence of 5* Weak Foot is a bonus, but the Shooting (91) and Passing (93) require boost. I think the card is well-worth the completion cost. It's a more economical alternative to the Paulo Dybala FUTTIES SBC.

I had my initial doubts about it, given that past DLCs haven't exactly hit the mark. But after spending around a week with it, any uncertainty I had was thrown out the door. 


The minute I stepped into this new pack, I immediately noticed a change in romantic relationships. It refreshes the Sims 4's age-old mechanics and instills a much more realistic concept. Simply put, it makes the dating world exceptionally entertaining, with a sprinkle of mature content. Sorry, kids, you'll have to sit this one out.

The Non-Denouement, for example, a bow from the Salvation's Edge raid, isn't that great on its own. However, two specific perks can turn it into a budget version of the Trinity Ghoul exotic bow. Combined with another handy exotic, it can make for a sweet combo. 


This is no different for other weapons, including a particularly interesting pulse rifle, the Nullify. If you're looking to make some major upgrades,  here's how to get the god roll for the Nullify pulse rifle in Destiny 2.

The biggest additions with Apex Legends Season 22 Shockwave are the new map and dual-wielding. E-District, as the neon-soaked map is called, is reminiscent of a cyberpunk Tokyo, and Respawn explains that it's got a lot of verticality for players to practice their skills in. Of course, this season's main highlight will be dual-wielding, which you can do with P2020s and Mozambiques. If that doesn't change the meta in a meaningful way, I don't know what will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first gameplay trailer for NBA 2K25 has dropped, and there are some massive changes in the pipeline.


To start things off, the ProPLAY feature will include over 9,000 new animations, which will be available on next-gen platforms. Additionally, developer Visual Concepts has revamped several core features from NBA 2K24 to offer a far more immersive experience. Plus, you can access the game two days early, if you decide you want to pre-order it.




NBA 2K25's offense and defense to get a boost from ProPLAY expansion


Visual Concepts has built on last year's ProPLAY feature, by expanding it with new animations.



The all-new Dribble Engine will include 1,500 dribbling animations. According to the developers, this is the biggest change to the gameplay engine, and the new system will try to replicate how NBA stars dribble their opponents in real life.


Over 1,100 signature shot animations will help you perform the same throws that Stephen Curry and co. do in NBA games.


Shot timing profiles have been revamped, and a new shot cancel feature will be added.


Players will be able to create more visual cues and use the right stick shooting to score more baskets.


In defense, there will be a brand new defensive cutoff system. Players can use the right stick to cut off an attack.





NBA 2K25's AI gameplay will also undergo changes in several areas to better complement the game. To make matters easier for all, the Learn 2K mode will be a one-stop destination if you're new to the franchise and looking to learn all the concepts.


NBA 2K25 early access plans revealed


If you pre-order the game before September 6, you can get up to two days of early access. Branded as "early tip-off", this offer will be available on all editions and include both next and current-gen.

Aero the Acro-Bat returns to the Big Top tomorrow, 2nd August 2024. But that isn't the end of the acrobatic bat's return to the stage. Ratalaika Games has revealed that it's rereleasing every single Aero the Acro-Bat game on Switch (and other consoles) over the next few months.
Following the first game's release, Aero The Acro-Bat 2 will arrive on 6th September; spin-off Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel will glide onto consoles on 4th October; and the GBA title Aero the Acro-bat: Rascal Rival Revenge rounds out the quartet on 1st November. That means, for the first time, all of the Aero the Acro-Bat games will be available digitally on modern consoles. Not bad for an oft-forgotten platformer from the SNES days, hey? Let's have a look at each of the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you actively played Monopoly GO during its previous Making Music season, you may remember just how often Wild Stickers would appear during events. These cards would often make or break sets, especially if you were just a few stickers away from completing the album and winning its grand prize. Although Monopoly Games' events have yet to reward any of these, this changes today with the introduction of City Racers, the sequel to Tycoon Racers.


Although Tycoon Racers has been in the works for months, it made its first worldwide debut in June 2024, with yet another Wild Sticker as a grand prize. Now, with City Racers live on August 1, the first Wild Sticker opportunity of Monopoly Games is here. However, if you're familiar with Tycoon Racers, you'll know how challenging it is to get first place, especially if you're up against a coordinated team who gets very lucky with their points rolls.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Wild Stickers are well-known for making sticker sets a cakewalk to finish if you consistently finish events that have them. They're one of the most helpful items in Monopoly GO, especially if you need rare golden stickers and can't find any Golden Blitz events. 


In the Making Music season, you could also find Wild Stickers in Peg-E's prize drop minigame, Tycoon Racers, and Partners events. Although Peg-E's minigame and Partners are somewhat easy to finish if you actively participate in events and have good teammates, Tycoon and City Racers are more challenging. Nonetheless, if you want to experience the first Wild Sticker appearance this season, City Racers is where you'll find it.


City Racers has a team-building grace period from August 1 to August 2, with the races starting at noon ET. From here, you'll have a few days to collect flags and participate in three races for a chance at the Wild Sticker, Speedy Scottie board token, and two sticker packs as the grand prize.

We've been playing the games for around a month now, and we're about halfway through each one. We've played Investigations before, when it came out on the DS in 2010, but this is the first time that Investigations 2, now known as Prosecutor's Gambit, has been translated officially for a release outside of Japan.

Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool.

When Nintendo launched Metroid Dread in 2021, there was no doubt in our minds that it would inspire more fast-paced, gritty Metroidvanias later down the road. MARS 2120 is one such title; a sci-fi romp that attempts to capture the same magic that made Dread so special, but ultimately falls at almost every hurdle.
It starts off strong, taking place on the surface of Mars where you’re fleeing from an avalanche of rocks and rubble. It’s exciting stuff, but even during this introductory sequence, something about the controls just felt off. You’re blessed with a double-jump ability right from the start, but executing it never feels quite natural enough considering how often you’ll need to use it throughout the game. It’s not bad, as such, but it feels a bit too floaty for our liking.

This delay applies to the Switch, PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, with the digital version for PS5, Xbox Series and PC still releasing as planned on 27th August. The physical edition for all consoles has also been pushed back to 17th September, with pre-orders now available.

This one launched in Japan back in February (with the 'Shiro of Coal Town' title) and sees things take a more mysterious turn than 2022's catchily titled Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey-.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you like your survival games? A nice bit of wood chopping while the birds chirp? Gathering some mushrooms while you deflect a little goblin's swings? Stumbling parched through a desert as a bed of scorpions prick your ankles with deadly venom? Well, Enshrouded may provide some or none of these experiences, but what its latest update does is capture their spirit. You'll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game's challenge. Otherwise, there's new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

He's the presenter of Krypta FM - pronounced with the chopped staccato of every good radio announcer as Kryp! Ta! FM! - and you are his eager listener and hopeful protege. Sniff the evening air. Breathe deep! The small town world that lies sleeping all around you is just teeming with cryptids, surely. Anyone seen a mothman lately? A werewolf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The immersive sim has seen a revival in recent years. Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

Animal caretaking horror game Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hikari-no-Akari, a long-established pirate site that specialized in Japanese music, has closed its doors voluntarily. The drastic decision comes shortly after Sony Music Entertainment Japan obtained a subpoena, requiring Cloudflare to share the personal details of the operator. Despite the shutdown, the Recording Industry Association of Japan still plans to hold the site's operator accountable.

With incidents like this running in parallel with apps that are blatantly infringing, a new discussion paper asks what more can be done to prevent apps and app stores being used for infringing purposes. We also suggest a free tool to limit exposure to app-related risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heyday of Sierra's adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Against The Storms’ critters, Manor Lords’s perfect oxen, and now Cataclismo, Hooded Horse’s roster of strategy games share a common thread that many guard-the-village-em-ups can fatally overlook: they present a civilisation that’s worth protecting. Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

That's right: Valve have added some new crates just outside of counter-terrorist spawn, near bombsite A. This means that players can now use these boxes to hop from CT up to catwalk with little fuss, where previously you'd need to use your teammates' heads as a springboard. What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!

It's a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

I didn't expect to see any rival catfish appearing in games after that, but now that I think about it - why not? They're a naturally freaky animal, perfect video game antagonists. And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore 'em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn. Come see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arranger is a puzzle game about moving, in both metaphorical and literal senses. Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Sinclair, CEO of Warframe studio Digital Extremes, reckons publishers should give live service games more time to find their footing, and not see dodgy release periods as a "make or break" indicator of a game’s success. "It comes out, doesn’t work and they throw it away," Sinclair told VGC.

I have not heard from them since. I fear their souls are even now pigmenting the tides of Destiny 2 gifs that fill the Maw's lower intestines. Sergeant Shagbert, Corporal Pieface, I will avenge you in the only way I know how: by posting some words on a website.

Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our former editor Katharine "Thorsbane" Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.
