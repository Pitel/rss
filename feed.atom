        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press F for a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sequel
Considering the series has been around for a few decades at this point, Call of Duty has had to reinvent itself over and over to keep bringing players fresh concepts. The games have covered concepts from the first World War all the way to futuristic space combat, and some were received better than others, to say the least. Now that the series has started cycling back through classic CoD eras like World War II and the modern day, I guess I should have realized that the franchise would be returning to some of their other, less beloved concepts too.
As of a report from known (and often right) Call of Duty leaker Ralph Valve, Sledgehammer's upcoming 2025 CoD title will be a sequel to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was originally released back in 2014. Valve also reports that Sledgehammer's next game was supposed to be a follow-up to the World War II-themed Vanguard, which didn't end up selling enough copies to warrant a sequel in its wake.
Advanced Warfare is certainly well-known, although a lot of that has to do with the now infamous "press F to pay respects" sequence. The gameplay allowed for increased mobility in gameplay thanks to the introduction of Exoskeleton armor, and fans seemed to like it enough before the series went fully futuristic with the near universally-disliked Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare that came out in 2016.
Although I have three different CoD titles under my belt now, I'm still getting to know the series, especially when it comes to the games with modern or futuristic settings. I guess if Valve's report is correct, then it's worth me going back to play some of the old games just to get a sense. From what I hear, though, I will definitely be steering clear of Call of Duty: Ghosts.

The news of Google Stadia's closure had an immediate effect on several developers. But it looks like Tequila Works and its horror game Gylt will be lasting beyond Stadia's closure.
Gylt was first released in November 2019 as a Google Stadia exclusive. In a new blog on the studio's website, the team confirms that Gylt will be heading to new platforms.
"Spooky season is around the corner... And we bring terrific news!" reads the quick update. "We've been working on it for a long time and it's finally time to make it official: Gylt is going multiplatform in 2023!"
No details about which platforms that entails have been released yet. Tequila Works suggest staying tuned to its social media channels for updates and news.

A Gylt trip
This is great news for Tequila Works fans who never got around to this particular project. The makers of Rime and The Sexy Brutale make some really cool-looking games, but Gylt was one of the notable exclusives Google nabbed for Stadia.
At least in this case, Gylt will not be riding off into the night. Hopefully we get some news soon about what platforms it will be coming to next year.
Meanwhile, other developers are trying to figure out their own solutions to Stadia's closure. Google announced the service is going down last week, confirming that it plans to refund users as well. The cloud streaming service for playing games launched in 2019, and has since seen competition rise from sources like Microsoft's xCloud.
The announcement came as a shock to some developers, who were still planning to bring games to the platform. Companies like Ubisoft, Bungie, and IO Interactive have all confirmed they're looking into methods of helping players who want to keep playing their games.

A couple of times a year, a "Phenomenon Game" pops up out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town. Trombone Champ fits that description. It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn't come from nowhere. The people who made Trombone Champ had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.
The game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto. They've been self-publishing games for about a decade, and most of their projects have been free. Trombone Champ is actually the first title they've ever sold on Steam, so you can imagine their surprise when it went on to sell 20,000+ copies in its launch window, prompting NBC, The New York Times, and the CBC to all come calling for interviews.
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaYsW-Q1lU[/embed]
Much to my surprise, they were also willing to talk to me for my Talking to Women about Videogames podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify). It's a small-time show by NBC standards, but since they had an OK time on Sup, Holmes (an interview live stream show for game devs I used to do), I guess they didn't mind coming back for another talk eight years later. I've been rooting for these two ever since then, long before I knew they were the people who made Trombone Champ, and it's been so great to see those roots grow into a tree made of trombones, thousands of dollars, and mainstream media attention.
We got into all that plus the couple's love of Star Trek, D&D, gnomes, my theories on the autobiographical nature of their gameography, and a lot more. Thanks again to Dan and Jackie for taking the time, and doing it on video to boot. It was (ahem) a "hoot."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready to battle some bosses
Dead Cells is widely regarded as one of the best roguelike games out there, and one of the best indie games of the past decade. It's one of those games you can play over and over again -- literally -- but for fans who are itching for something new, well, the Dead Cells dev team has you covered. The studio behind the game, Motion Twin, along with their subsidiary studio Evil Empire, announced an all-new Boss Rush mode as an add-on for the PC version of Dead Cells.
The idea is that players will have four unique stages to play through, and each stage has the player going up against bosses from the game back-to-back. The breakdown of stages goes like this: stage one has three bosses, stage two has five bosses, stage three has three enhanced bosses, and stage four has five enhanced bosses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCaZwowMm78
The enhanced bosses are new for the Boss Rush mode, and as you might expect, they have ways to make their already-intense battles even harder, like healing powers or allies that come and join them in the fight. If you've played through some of the harder heats in Hades, think of the enhanced boss stages like runs where you're only fighting Extreme Measures bosses.
Each stage also features Dead Cells bosses randomly selected from Tiers 1, 2, or 3, to which they are assigned based on how difficult they are -- so at least you won't be fighting The Queen five times in a row. The Boss Rush mode is accessible in-game through a door in the basement of the Prisoners' Quarters. Players will also win some serious loot as they defeat the different stages, with the type of prizes scaling depending on how many bosses they fight, which bosses they fight, and so on.
The Boss Rush mode is available now in Dead Cells for PC players, and will be coming to consoles later this month.

As announced on Twitter, there will be several Nintendo concerts going on this month: specifically kicking off on October 10 at 11:00 CEST (5AM ET).
While details are slim, we do know that the digital concerts will feature the DJ K.K. [Slider] Animal Crossing: New Horizons Paradise Mix and Splatoon 3 Deep Cut performances. Based on the YouTube description, the concert is scheduled to go on for roughly one hour. To be clear, Nintendo has clarified that "both performances will be in Japanese without localized subtitles." You may recall that Nintendo has done various forms of K.K. Slider and Splatoon idol performances in the past, so this is mainly continuing that trend.
It's good to see Animal Crossing back in the fold in some form, as the great rush of billions of amiibo figures/cards seems to be at an end, alongside of major New Horizons updates. Splatoon 3 of course just came out, and alongside of regular free updates and Splatfests, will have a nice little footprint going into the holiday season.
It's also a nice way to see the newest Splatoon trio in action, given how popular the past characters have been!

Killer Queen Black launched back in 2019, and it's been a staple of my household ever since. The extremely unconventional team-versus-team game involved 5v5 battles to the death, with multiple ways to win each match. It encouraged a heavy dollop of team communication and tactical nuance in a way most games couldn't touch. But the era of playing it at home online is coming to an end on November 30, 2022.
Thankfully, Liquid Bit CEO Matt Tesch has fully explained the situation in a new blog, which they say is out of their hands. The crux of the problem is Amazon GameSparks, which essentially hosted the backend of Killer Queen Black. Amazon shut it down on September 30, but the team was able to get an "extension," through November 30, partially to finish out …]]></summary>

CD Projekt RED co-founder and joint CEO Marcin Iwiński has announced that they are stepping down from their role at the Polish studio, following a near-30-year tenure with the Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer. Iwiński made the announcement via an official statement posted Tuesday.
"I am beginning a brand new personal chapter at CD Projekt, as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman to the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint CEO role," writes Iwiński. "I’ve been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognized developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by million globally."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new voice for the Umbra Witch
The next entry in the Bayonetta series arrives this month. But the voice actor of the series' protagonist won't be returning for Bayonetta 3.
In an interview with Game Informer for its cover story on Bayonetta 3, Platinum Games confirms that Hellena Taylor, the voice actress of Bayonetta in the first two games, is not returning for the third.
Fans had speculated this may be the case, but now Platinum has made it clear. Rather than Taylor, Bayonetta will be voiced by popular voice actor Jennifer Hale.
"Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role," said game director Yusuke Miyata to Game Informer. "We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom we felt was a good match for the character. I understand the concerns some fans have about the voice change at this point in the series, but Jennifer's performance was way beyond what we could have imagined. I'm confident that her portrayal of Bayonetta will exceed our fans' expectations."
Bayonetta's voice actor for the Japanese VO will still be Atsuko Tanaka.

A new voice in the fray
Jennifer Hale is well-known for her work on several different game franchises, ranging from Rivet in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Ashe in Overwatch to perhaps her most well-known role as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy. There's little question that Platinum got someone talented to fill the shoes (gun-heels?) of Bayonetta.
Whether Hale fits as well as Taylor did for Bayonetta or not is the question. GI's coverage seems positive on the change, commending Hale's portrayal as being "sometimes indistinguishable" from Taylor's work in the first two games. But if you want to find out yourself, you'll have to wait until later this month.
Bayonetta 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on October 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Killer Instinct's ranked mode has, for some time now, been the target of one individual, who has been rendering the leaderboards an absolute mess with a flurry of fake accounts, which they have used to essentially "jam" the online rankings for the dedicated KI community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upgraded from "Winter 2022"
As you may recall, Capcom has a grand plan for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak post-launch support, which involves a roadmap with both pointed details and teasers. We got a major free title update in August, then another one in late September. Now, Capcom has confirmed that free title update 3, the next huge Monster Hunter Rise update, is coming in late November.
While it was previously slated for "winter 2022," it's now a sure thing for next month, and currently the plans include variant monsters (previously billed as "special species monsters"), as well as powered-up monsters. Capcom teases that more will be revealed in the coming weeks, and there's still "free title updates" slated for 2023. We're still unsure on the scope of what 2023 will bring, but so far the free title updates have injected more life into the game: which technically began with the launch of Rise in March of 2021.
Typically, on Switch, these patches will run around 0.6GB-1GB in size, and will add all sorts of quality of life features (including new guild card pages or awards), and bug fixes. While I'm not playing as much Rise currently with other stuff on my plate, it's nice to know that I won't miss anything diving back in, and these free updates will be waiting.

Developer GOATi Entertainment has revealed that its futuristic racing title 22 Racing Series will be heading to the Switch in 2023 after a period of early access on Steam starting on November 22nd, 2022.
It's another racer that reminds us of Nintendo's own F-Zero franchise, which at the time of writing has now been dormant for nearly two decades. Still, that's not to take away from 22 Racing Series, which, despite the rather lacklustre title, looks pretty darn good!

Sony Interactive Entertainment and Disney have announced that the shiny PS5 platform now has its own native Disney+ app available for download. This will allow users on the platform to access the Disney streaming service on their console in magnificent 4K HDR resolutions.
"A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we're excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users," notes EVP of product and design for Disney, Jerrell Jimerson in comments to The Verge. "The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans."
With the arrival of the Disney+ app, subscribers will now have access to an enormous archive of film, TV, and animated content from The House of Mouse. This includes films and shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — such as recent Chud-aggravator She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, as well as thousands of hours of classic FOX programming such as the good episodes of The Simpsons and nothing else. Of course, you can also check out Disney's legendary catalog of classic animated movies, all starring wicked queens that I fancy.
Now that the PlayStation 5 platform offers access to Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, HBO Max, as well as an abundance of rad video games via the PlayStation Plus service, you basically don't have to leave the couch ever again. Better get started this weekend, however, I'm pretty sure none of us have the time necessary to watch every single episode of every single Star Wars show before we shuffle on.
And I still gotta find space and time for the celluloid excellence that is Hocus Pocus 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.]]></summary>

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is getting an upgrade for newer console hardware. Both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console versions of Kakarot are on the way with some shiny new graphics options.
These versions will launch on January 13, 2023, right near the start of the new year. For those who already have Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, Bandai Namco Entertainment will have a free upgrade path. Physical versions of the newer generation title will also be in the works.
As for the features, faster loading times and fluid gameplay up to 60 FPS are what Bandai Namco's got in store. There are also new visual details. The in-game card game Card Warriors will also be available as an offline version, for solo play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAW8DAEJWp0
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot will be available as just the standalone Standard Edition, or with the Deluxe or Legendary Edition, which include some of the post-launch DLC for Kakarot. Deluxe buyers get the first Season Pass, while Legendary buyers get the first and second Season Pass.
Rock the dragon
This action-RPG-ish take on Goku's journey will be just about two years old when the newer generation versions hit, and it's received a fair bit of support. As mentioned before, there are two Season Passes worth of content, plus more DLC that apparently features Goku's dad Bardock on the way.
But if 2D fighting games are more your Dragon Ball flavor, there's still some good news on the way. It was confirmed at Evo 2022 that Dragon Ball FighterZ will be getting PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, with rollback netcode on the way too. It seems like a pretty good time if you're a Dragon Ball fan with a new console, eager to see how the new hardware can render all those Gokus.

It also reveals some co-op hunting action for the first time. Take a look at the footage below, and try not to giggle when the sproingy hammer whacks the giant piggy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live service titles are an exception
PlayStation Studios' head Hermen Hulst has noted that he expects future PlayStation titles to enjoy at least a year's exclusivity on home console platforms before making the jump to PC — The former Guerrilla Games managing director made the comments in an interview with journalist Julien Chieze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXSyAfNuvg8&t=432s
"I think, going forward, we’ll see at least a year between releases on PlayStation and on the PC platform, possibly with the exception of live service games," said Hulst when asked about the recent range of PC ports. "Live service games are a little bit different in nature because you want to have a strong community, strong engagement right away, right when you go live. So we might, in the case of our live service offerings, go day and date with PC and the PlayStation platform."
The Steam community has recently enjoyed a wide variety of previously considered PlayStation exclusives, including stellar releases such as God of War; Marvel's Spider-Man and its follow-up Miles Morales; Horizon Zero Dawn; as well as games from Naughty Dog's best-selling Uncharted franchise. Rumors also abound that Housemarque's PS5 sci-fi smash, Returnal, is also en route to the Steam platform.
Given Hulst's comments, it seems that PlayStation continues in its commitment to bringing its best-sellers to the PC audience but, understandably, wishes to give its loyal PS4/PS5 community priority. So while Steam fans will have to sit on their hands a little, they can be sure their patience will pay off.
PlayStation games will wait ‘at least a year’ before their PC release, except for live service titles [VGC]

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…]]></summary>

Microsoft has just unveiled their Xbox Game Pass October offerings, and so far it's looking good, especially when it comes to variety. I mean, it's pretty much on point every month in that regard, but genre-wise, there's a good spread.
One highlight includes Telltale's Walking Dead, which is launching both Season 1 and Season 2 on October 6. This is some of Telltale's earliest work, before they took on way too many projects and imploded. Chivalry 2 isn't a bad get either, and you can throw in the quirky Costume Quest for good measure.
Bigger Xbox Game Pass releases include Plague Tale: Requiem and Scorn later this month, which are day-and-date brand new launches with Game Pass. Both of those include cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S platforms. We're not losing a lot this month either! It should be a fun little time to sail into the winter season with a ton of games to play.
You can find the full schedule with exact dates below for both the additions and departures.

Xbox Game Pass October schedule:
Week of October 3:
Chivalry 2, October 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Medieval Dynasty, October 6 (Xbox Series X|S)

Week of October 10:

These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

Well, with the Street Fighter 6 beta creeping round the corner, we're starting to see some much-needed changes.
From notes written in the Ranked Mode menu screen, we can ascertain that Street Fighter 6 will once again see players win and lose points in online battles, as they progress through eight recognizable tiers: Rookie, Iron (new), Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we're just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling. 
Are you going to check out the new-gen version of Kakarot next year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Nintendo has released a new trailer for the long-awaited Switch port of Persona 5 Royal, shining the spotlight on the game's iconic animated cutscenes and slick gameplay.
The huge JRPG from Atlus launches later this month on October 21st and it's safe to say we're pretty excited! If you're unfamiliar with the game, it initially launched on PS3 and PS4 in Japan back in 2016 before making its way worldwide in 2017. The 'Royal' upgrade came a couple of years later and added several enhancements, including a new playable character, a new location and Palace, new music, and additional social elements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force and EA revealed Wild Hearts last week, giving players a glimpse of what's to come in this new beast-hunting game. 
Similar to Capcom's Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Wild Hearts, be sure to check out the reveal trailer from last week.

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.
“Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,” says game director Yusuke Miyata. “We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's running through November 9
A new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it's currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.
As a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it'll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector's edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It'll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
Here is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:
Rabbid Mario Figurine
Rabbid Peach Figurine
Set of 3 lithographs
Spark Plush
Artbook
Spark Phone Ring Holder
Stickers Sheet

The latest UK boxed charts data is here (after a short delay) and as expected, EA's FIFA 23 has taken the top spot, knocking Splatoon 3 down a peg after several weeks at number one.
This first place securement can't really be attributed to Switch, mind, with the Nintendo console only making up 6% of total sales (PS5 brought in 41%, PS4 - 30%, and Xbox One produced 17%). This should come as no surprise, with the Switch once again receiving few updates with the game's Legacy Edition, we can't see the incentive to get out there and buy it - as is reflected in our unimpressed 2/10 review.

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention. On the one hand, it seemed to wear its Portal-inspiration on its sleeve, an immediate draw for me. On the other hand, its concept as a puzzle game sounded new and unique: use a weapon that turns back time on individual objects aboard a space station to stop the Earth from exploding.

The Legend of Zelda franchise is well known for its incredible music. With iconic tracks including 'Lost Woods' and 'Gerudo Valley' from Ocarina of Time alongside the beautiful, ambient music from Breath of the Wild, we imagine many composers would no doubt feel a tad overwhelmed at the prospect of adding to the franchise's astounding back catalogue.
One man who reckons he's up to the job, however, is Shoji Meguro, the esteemed sound director of Atlus's Persona series, who worked on the franchise until his departure in 2021. Speaking with Nintenderos, he praised Xenoblade Chronicles and Fire Emblem before clearly stating a desire to write music for The Legend of Zelda:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.
Whether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond "perfectly enjoyable" into "thrilling", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

There is something deeply appealing about playing with trains. They go exactly where you tell them to, yet can still behave in unexpected ways to keep things interesting. Railgrade from developer Minakata Dynamics is a great railway management sim game with some fun quirks. While it doesn’t go as deep into its mechanics as other games in the genre, it manages to be entertaining throughout its lengthy campaign.
Mastering the careful balancing act of cost versus efficiency is at the heart of Railgarde, which casts players in the role of Administrator for the dubious Nakatani Chemicals corporation. A recent arrival to the company’s space colony, your role is to manage the resources at sites and make sure everything is running smoothly across the planet. That means setting up increasingly complex railway systems to deliver materials, energy, and goods where they need to go.

I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again.

While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we'd discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we're now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there's something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights.

It's a new era for Blizzard's Overwatch series - with the company rolling out Overwatch 2 across multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch today. It's free-to-play, features cross-platform play and progression and can be downloaded now from the Switch eShop.
Unfortunately, the launch hasn't gone entirely to plan. In a post on social media, company president Mike Ybarra revealed the game's servers have apparently been on the receiving end of a "mass DDoS attack", which has been creating a lot of drop and connection issues.

I've always loved snakes. When I was in middle school, we had one of those Snakes Alive! organizations come and do an educational demonstration. I guess I didn't look as scared or grossed out as the other kids, because the host called me up and handed me a black snake, who then found his way into the pocket of my hoodie. It was adorable.
That said, I don't think I would ever own a reptile, but I love looking at cute snake videos as much as the next person. That's why it was such a treat to log into Twitter today and see that someone had taught their pet snake how to play Pokémon Go. I didn't know you could even train a snake to do such a thing, but I'm so, so glad that this person did.
https://twitter.com/SnakeHour/status/1577043448750047232
The tweet was from an account called @SnakeHour (which posts snake content on the hour every hour for all your snake content needs), but the original video is a TikTok from user @maudespaperwinggallery. It features the snake's owner holding them up in front of a phone that has Pokémon Go open, and the snake then uses their little nose to launch Poké Balls at what appears to be a Combee. What really tops off the whole thing for me is the classic Pokémon anime theme song playing over the video.
Now I want to know — does the snake have their own account? Does their owner take them outside on Pokémon-catching adventures? Which Team did they join? Most importantly: did they ever end up catching the Combee? It's likely we won't get any more information about this scaly little guy or gal, as is the way of the internet, but they will forever live on in my heart.
Good luck, you sweet little Pokémon master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anybody need a hug?
Now considered one of the best indie titles of 2020, Spiritfarer is one of the coziest and most heartfelt games out there. If you haven't played it yet, it's a definite must if you ask me, and now you can play it right on your phone — if you have Netflix, that is. That's right, Spiritfarer is the next banger of a game that has been added to the streaming company's games library, along with Oxenfree and Moonlighter, to name a few.
Spiritfarer has players take on the role of Stella, a young girl who is to become the new Spiritfarer, or a figure who helps the souls of those who have passed and escorts them safely to the afterlife. It sounds bleak, but it's actually one of the most whimsical, touching, and comforting takes on death I've seen. The gameplay includes cooking, gardening, gathering materials, upgrading your boat, and giving hugs to those who might need them.
https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1535317620710420480?lang=en
Like I said, it's one of the best simulators out there, and it's a smart move for Netflix to grab such a beloved game to help bring players to their platform. The company is going harder on its gaming venture than ever before, having recently announced that it has its own internal studios working to develop original IPs. Netflix also let us know about a new partnership with mobile games publisher Tilting Point, who has helped bring cooking game Spongebob: Get Cooking and an upcoming Narcos-themed game to the platform.
It's a hard push, and after the closure of Google's Stadia in the past few weeks, it'll be interesting to see how Netflix fares in an already hyper-competitive market. The difference could be made in their dedication to creating their own titles in addition to games we already know and love, after all.

Nintendo has completed its acquisition of CG production company Dynamo Pictures, and has now restructured and relaunched the studio as Nintendo Pictures. The company will now work with Nintendo on video production and the facilitation of its motion capture and other CGI projects.
Dynamo Pictures confirmed the relaunch on its newly designed website, now emblazoned with the Nintendo Pictures logo and sporting the familiar red-and-white color scheme.
"We aim to have consumers around the world learn about Nintendo characters through video, and to create unique videos that will remain in their memories forever", reads a short statement (as translated by Google.) "To that end, each and every one of our employees will always think about what our customers around the world will find interesting, and we will work hard to create an organization that can continue to grow by engaging in video production with interest.
"We will continue to challenge ourselves to continue providing unique and surprising images to customers around the world, transcending generations and eras."
Dynamo Pictures has formally worked with Nintendo and other video game developers to provide cutscenes, intros, and other animated elements for titles such as Metroid: Other M, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Persona 5, Yakuza, and Catherine. Acquired by Nintendo after the publisher purchased in July of this year, it is expected that the studio will now work exclusively for the publisher under its new moniker.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has found that Activision Blizzard withheld raises from quality assurance workers at subsidiary Raven Software. And the board attributes this withholding to those workers' union activity.
Via The Washington Post, the NLRB found that video game publisher Activision Blizzard withheld raises from the QA testers, who had voted to unionize in May of this year.
In April, QA testers at Activision Blizzard were offered a raise to $20/hour. The recently organized Raven testers, however, were not able to take this offer.

It’s been a few years since I’ve seriously played Overwatch, so sometimes I forget how seriously into that game I was. It was the first online multiplayer game I ever really got into, and I played it for somewhere around 1,500 hours between my PlayStation and PC. I had a team of guys that I met in-game that I would play with when I was in college — I made sure to have my homework done early every night so we could play from 10pm to 2 in the morning. I even ended up going to one of my teammate’s weddings.
As I got busier and started moving on, Overwatch itself started changing a lot, too. It was around the time that the Overwatch League was gearing up, and Blizzard had been rolling out all kinds of changes to the game that made it feel entirely differe…]]></summary>

Whether you loathe the "wholesome game" moniker or not, you have to admit: Paradise Marsh looks gorgeous. Looking at its soft, rounded font (reminiscent of beloved indie game A Short Hike) and cast of friendly bugs and critters with gigantic peepers, don't you just want to dive in to this warm-coloured beetlescape?
Paradise Marsh has a lot of the wholesome boxes checked — frogs, check; bug catching, check; flower picking, check; low stakes, check; ambient music, check (by FEZ composer Disasterpeace!) — and yes, it has featured on two Wholesome Direct trailers. But it's clear that it's more than just another toothless fluff game.

Street Fighter and Power Rangers continue to enjoy a fun, if altogether bemusing, crossover friendship — Not content with adding the iconic Ryu and Chun-Li into nWay fighter Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid, toy maker Hasbro continues to add World Warriors to its brand new action figure line Street Fighter X Power Rangers Lightning Collection.
As featured in the recent Hasbro Pulse Con showcase, the merchandiser revealed that Ryu's fiery rival, Ken Masters, and Red Delta's stellar operative, Cammy White, are the next two Wrld Warriors in line to receive a Mighty Morphin' makeover. Ken will step into his new guise as the Soaring Falcon Ranger, while Cammy becomes the Stinging Crane Range, complete with a brand new projectile attack!

 
As with Ryu and Chunners' Power Rangers pseudonyms, the new designs for Ken and Cammy reflect the colors and costumes of their Street Fighter iterations, freshly tweaked to fit within the bodysuited battleverse of the long-running Saban franchise. Ken appears to be sleeveless in his ranger gear, which must be borderline heresy to the Power Rangers community. Cammy is instantly recognizable, and even has a red metal beret sculpted directly into her battle helmet.

Ken and Cammy stand around six inches in height and feature full articulation, allowing them to be posed in all manner of dynamic stances. In addition, the figures come with various effect elements, so they can be displayed performing their unique, special attacks. The figures are expected to retail for around $35 USD, and will launch in March 2023. The Ryu and Chun-Li Power Rangers variants are available to pre-order right now, and are expected to launch a month earlier in February 2023.

At launch, Overwatch was a powerhouse. It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.
Overwatch became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some egregious activities at the company. Many games at Blizzard, Overwatch included, haven't recovered from everything that happened.
Can Overwatch 2 bring the series back into the forefront? Well, it depends on a few things.

Liquid Bit's strategy multiplayer game Killer Queen Black is shutting down on 30th November. In an update posted to the developer's website, Matt Tesch — CEO of Liquid Bit — shared the disappointing news with fans (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
The reason for the game's shutdown is a result of the closure of the original Gamesparks, a service that enabled devs to build games while the Gamesparks platform itself managed various backend tasks (typically including game configuration, scaling, online authentication, leaderboards, and other more 'behind-the-scenes' facets of the software) using a cloud infrastructure.

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…]]></summary>

Publisher Sega and developer Relic Entertainment have announced that the incoming strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 has been hit with a delay and will no longer meet its November release date — It is now rescheduled to launch on PC on February 23, 2023.
Speaking in a statement on Twitter, the development team said that it believes the military sequel is not quite up to the standards expected of the team or the player community, and will be using the additional four months for additional development time, stamping out bugs, tweaking balance, and further polishing visual elements of the final product. Company of Heroes 3 had previously taken steps to revitalize its build following feedback from a beta period, which took place in November of last year.
https://twitter.com/CompanyOfHeroes/status/1577297241894789124?s=20&t=3DZZoaA22NyOmP1nlLlPxw
Showing remarkable restraint for video game fans, the Company of Heroes community reacted to news of the day with positive patience, asking Relic to continue with their work in hopes of delivering the greatest entry in the acclaimed series to date. CoH 3 is set against the backdrop of the Italian and African theaters of World War II, and will feature all of the scalpel-precise, point-balancing, tactical action of the previous games, complete with a whole new environmental destruction engine and several new visual effect improvements. Additionally, players will be able to pause the action and queue up multiple maneuvers — allowing plans to be executed in real time when gameplay resumes.
Company of Heroes 3 will launch February 23, 2023 on PC. Get your not-so-qucik march on.

All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you're wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you're wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

Thanks to a fantastic tweet from user itsybatsy, the ska ska Chocobo theme can now be shared with the masses. You can listen to it below. Then listen to it again. And again.
In case you're wondering: it's from Final Fantasy Record Keeper, which came out roughly eight years ago. Sadly, the game is no longer active, as service ended globally on September 29. But that hasn't stopped folks from sharing their memories of the game, including some Record Keeper exclusive aesthetics and songs. Record Keeper actually has multiple versions of the Chocobo theme, including this fiddle-related sampling, and more traditional versions.
Knowing that there's a ska version of the Chocobo theme that now needs to be preserved wholly by fans is really sad: and speaks to the transient nature of mobile-only games. While we haven't exited the era of endless-mobile-games-as-a-service-only-to-be-shutdown-a-few-years-later; they're still prevalent, and many of them have some really cool moments of creativity like this song.
Ideally, we can preserve a lot of them through various means like clipping parts of it and posting them on social media. While Record Keeper had fundamental issues, stuff like this deserves to be remembered. Hearing different takes on classic tracks almost never gets old.

Information about The Super Mario Movie — you know, the one with Chris Pratt — has been slimmer than Bowser's chances with Peach, but that's all about to change. This week, Nintendo has announced a special movie-related Nintendo Direct, meaning that we'll hopefully get to hear Pratt's take on the plumber, sans Charles Martinet's iconic voice. Also, what the movie is actually about. Maybe.
Until Thursday, 6th October at 1:05pm Pacific Time (when the Direct is scheduled to take place), all we have to go on is... this poster. Let's take a look:

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A closed test is in the works
The new Freelancer mode for Hitman 3 is getting another delay. Agent 47's new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.
A new blog from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for Hitman 3: Freelancer, in a series it's calling Road to Freelancer. The Hitman developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.
On October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for Hitman 3. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will start and how to get access.
Then, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otBhG8ZldvQ
Freelancer was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. Hitman 3 has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island dropping in July.
A new way to play
The upcoming Freelancer mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the Hitman formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.
This mode seems like a way to not just test out veteran Hitman players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool. IO says today that it's pushed beyond its initial scope for Freelancer to include "almost all locations" from the World of Assassination trilogy on day one. It's also going to be a free update for Hitman 3 owners.
So if you've got Hitman 3 on PC via Steam, you might be able to hop into the Freelancer test. Otherwise, it's headed to Hitman 3 owners on January 26, 2023.

Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says "it is the beginning of a new saga" and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don't get too excited just yet – this first look isn't a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

October 4, 2022
Here's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation's investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, "further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. 
"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities," he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix's Witcher series, and Bloober Team's own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
"Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together," Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. "The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions." 
As noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WD SN550 is going cheap at Ebuyer's Ebay UK page right now, with a 2TB drive costing just £118.98. That's an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That's about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you'll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

October 3, 2022
This premiere is being dubbed as the "first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like "Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim."
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It's just, I am an idiot.

Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the "Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

        <updated>2022-09-30T21:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.
"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture," he said in a press release. "I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it."
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.]]></summary>

As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, you look forward to a game's release and it's very disappointing. Sometimes, it comes out and it's... fine. Kinda good, even. Only once does the game come out and it's fuckin’ SPIDERHECK WOOOO!
Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I've ever heard. I'd hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it's more glorious than I dared to hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds "for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store," according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you "will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date." 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says "most hardware purchases...made directly from Google" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

I'd literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn't hold back his tears, which said it all, really.
As one's mind does in momentous occasions, it turned to Nintendo Switch Sports football and how its small roster of players may be one of the best representations of talent in a sports game that I've come across. Come on, humour me here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. 
Are you excited to play Skull and Bones next March? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game's reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You'll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you're someone who's a fan of Capcom's long-running Monster Hunter series.

Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it's a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we're now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director's cut special editions. We've included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month's Time Capsule, but there's another notable exception we've decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016's Special Edition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a definition of "pure" that's proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his "Ask me about Loom" badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you're a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique.

The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region.

        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

Blizzard today outlined how they intend to prevent "disruptive behaviour" from players, including the use of SMS verification and machine learning. More awkwardly, game modes will be locked for first-time players, and Overwatch 1's original heroes will only be unlocked "over the course of approximately 100 matches."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Grounded released into early access a little over two years ago, it immediately became a personal favourite. The story wasn't complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo's Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home planet to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin. As a fan of “little person in a big world” experie…]]></summary>

However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel's new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass. The pass' free track allows players to unlock a new support character named Kiriko, while its premium track – which costs $10 or 1,000 Overwatch Coins – offers unique cyberpunk-themed cosmetics like weapon charms, souvenirs, and legendary skins. Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch's new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea's Game Rating committee, and it's possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

September 22, 2022
The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>
