        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult classic horror Clock Tower is getting a remaster next year and releasing outside of Japan for the first time since its 1995 debut.

It's sometimes easy to forget just how far The Legend of Zelda franchise has come over the years and how much we've all collectively experienced as fans.
From the humble 3D beginnings of Ocarina of Time to the bonafide masterpiece that is Tears of the Kingdom, the franchise has explored many different paths yet has somehow still maintained a comforting sense of familiarity; a familiarity that creator Chris Ormondroyd has decided to lean into with his remarkable fan-made trailer for the franchise (albeit without the 2D entries).

Update : If you thought that the conflict surrounding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was all over, think again. Earlier this week, a California judge ruled in favour of Microsoft and denied the Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction against the deal. The FTC has now filed an appeal against that decision.
The news was shared by The Verge's senior editor @tomwarren, who noted that the regulator's argument behind the appeal has not been shared yet and will likely remain that way until it is submitted to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — which may then be able to issue "an emergency stay to extend the existing temporary restraining order", currently set to expire on 14th July.

The infamous CD-i titles Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon will apparently be getting a "spiritual successor" known as Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore.
This entirely new game developed by Seedy Eye Software is described as an "interactive animated adventure". Some of the talent involved in this project has also been revealed, including Jeffrey Rath - who voiced Link in the cutscenes of the CD-i games, as well as Bonniejean Wilbur, who was the voice of Zelda.

Look, I’m not going to pretend that new games on retro hardware is a novel concept. If Destructoid’s Zoey “The Flying Zebra” Handley can write 1000+ words about an Atari Lynx game that came out in 2009, nothing should surprise me. I say should, because WayForward has announced that Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution will hit the Game Boy Advance in 2024, and it’s taken me a good hour to wrap my mind around it.
To provide some backstory, Shantae Advance is a long, long lost chapter of WayForward’s trademark Shantae series. Though it began development in the early 2000s, the lackluster sales of the first Shantae game scared off potential publishers. Refusing to release a compromised version of the game, WayForward decided to cancel the project in 20…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little tongue now, a lot of tail later (What!?)
As part of the Limited Run Games Showcase stream, the physical publisher announced that they’re resurrecting the GEX series as in the GEX Trilogy. Wow. Oh no.
Like a few of their surprise game announcements, there wasn’t much to go on from the trailer they showed. If I’m not mistaken, the James Bond parody was a promo for the third game way back in the day. Or maybe it was the second. That lizard really liked parodying characters who were cooler than him. However, the trailer does reveal that the GEX Trilogy will be coming to most current platforms via the Carbon Engine.
https://youtu.be/HhXZZsEfRgk
So, Timothy “Toothpick-Fingers” Monbleau and I immediately started venting our shared trauma with this announcement. He played a lot of the first game on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, while I, as a kid, spent way too much time playing GEX 64. None of the three games included in the trilogy are terrible, honestly. If anything, the most grating part about it is listening to the eponymous gecko spit one-liners that I didn’t really understand at the time. The first game is a sidescroller, whereas the two that followed are collect-a-thon platformers.
Anyway, any port of these games is a net gain. I’ll be honest, I will probably pick up a digital copy of the GEX Trilogy. I already own all three of these games (the first on Saturn, the other two on N64), but I’m willing to shell out to have them in one place and support the endeavors of kusoge preservation.
GEX Trilogy is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC at some point in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nice do
As part of the Limited Run Games showcase, the boutique publisher announced a number of retro games that are getting modern ports. Among them is Tomba, the 1998 (1997 if you count the Japanese release) platformer by legendary developer Tokuro Fujiwara.
Tomba is a game about the eponymous and fabulous pink-haired caveman. It’s a rather ambitious gated exploration platformer for the PS1 platform that got a sequel, but not nearly enough love. I was actually introduced to it through the passionate rantings of Destructoid alumni James Stephanie Sterling. Original PS1 copies go for mad dough on the collector’s market, but I think seeing one in person might have me making my wallet cry.
However, it’s not necessary for you to make your wallet cry. Instead, Limited Run Games is bringing Tomba to modern platforms. That’s about all the information we have right now. The trailer shown during the stream was just a cutscene. A Tweet following the stream clarified that it will be coming to us with the help of the proprietary Carbon Engine, and will have physical and digital versions.
https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1679227783149486082?s=20
Good enough! I’m just happy that Limited Run Games is whole hogging it with retro revivals. Game preservation has been a topic that I’ve been pounding on for a while now, and I’m happy to see another company take a leap with it. Limited Run Games has had a history with preservation, but it seems like they’re really doubling down on it!
Tomba will be coming to PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC eventually. No word yet if Tomba 2 will be getting the same treatment.

Today during the Limited Run Games 2023 Showcase, the physical specialists announced a hard copy of the Castlevania Advance Collection.

It contains Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, and Aria of Sorrow – with the SNES version of Castlevania: Dracula X, included as a bonus.
Pre-orders for the physical copy will open later this month on 28th July on the official Limited Run Games website and it's priced at $34.99 (or your regional equivalent). There'll also apparently be four different covers to choose from, with more information coming soon.

Way back in 2021, Square Enix was spotted filing a trademark for the forgotten '90s platforming mascot Gex. Now, today during the Limited Run Games Showcase for 2023, dreams have come true, with the publisher announcing the return of the anthropomorphic gecko. It's not one or two, but three games in a trilogy collection for the Switch and multiple other platforms.
This collection will include Gex (1995), Gex: Enter the Gecko (1998), and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko (1999) and is running on Limited Run's Carbon Engine - "a development tool that allows legacy content to be ported to modern platforms". There's no release date, details, or price yet, but when we get an update we'll let you know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Home sweet home.
Most horror game fans will recognize the cult classic series Clock Tower as a PlayStation-exclusive franchise. The first game in the series to ever come to the West was on the original PlayStation, but a few years prior in 1995, the series started off on the Super Famicom in Japan as a point-and-click horror adventure. This original Clock Tower never made it to the West officially and has been quite the curiosity for many. However, that curiosity will soon be piqued yet again as Limited Run Games just revealed a collaboration with WayForward and Sunsoft to bring this darling thriller to Nintendo Switch.
This enhanced version of the sprite-based, scissor-tormented horror title is being officially translated in English (and more) for the first time, accompanied by a new animated opening by WayForward, motion comic cutscenes at the start and end of the game, and a new vocal theme song Mary McGlynn, famous for her work on the Silent Hill series
Clock Tower is currently slated for release sometime in early 2024. A price is yet to be determined, but Limited Run have confirmed that a digital and physical release are both in the works.

Were you aware of this Japan-exclusive horror title? Have you been waiting ages to give this game a slice of your time? Let us know your thoughts down below.

Blizzard President Mike Ybarra took to Twitter to squash a rumor that Diablo 4 was coming to Game Pass. In a tweet that has since been deleted, an ad from Brazilian gift card retailer PICPAY indicated Diablo 4 was on Xbox Game Pass.
"Available now. Get it now or play it through Xbox Game Pass" the advertisement allegedly read. Ybarra didn't mince words when responding to the claim, stating "This is not happening."
https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1678564200581595137
This isn't the first time Blizzard has addressed the possibility of Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. Back in May, Executive Producer Rod Fergusson tweeted "We've been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that." Although it seems like a popular request for the action-RPG to be part of the membership, it doesn't appear that will happen any time soon.
Maybe other Blizzard games will hit Game Pass
I know it's hard to even imagine Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. But with recent legal developments, it may not be a strange thought for long. After all, Bethesda's first brand new IP in a long time, Starfield, will launch on Game Pass day 1.
We may see not-so-new Blizzard titles eventually make their way to the pass. Perhaps even the older iterations of Diablo like Diablo III. We'll have to see which Blizzard IP finds its way to the subscription service first.
For now, though, it looks like Diablo 4 will continue to have a full-price barrier to entry. Who knows, maybe we'll get some sort of discount when Season 1 of Diablo 4 releases on July 20.

Like a beautiful and unusual fish that has suddenly risen to the surface, Dave the Diver is an unexpected surprise. Juggling two core systems that work in tandem, it’s a game that excels as both an exploration experience and as a management sim and does so in ways that are intuitive and easy to pick up. However, the real triumph is a focus on novelty at every turn, with a near-constant supply of sudden twists, activities, and ways to engage with the game, resulting in a joyful and approachable adventure that is hard to put down.
Dave is a scuba diver, summoned to a strange blue hole in the ocean filled with all manner of marine life. He’s …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, an upcoming sequel in the classic beat 'em up series. Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.
Enjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


Developer Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. 
Secret Base says the beat 'em up features "seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves." Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch and online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The founding of the Ketsuyama Bakufu
Toplitz has announced Sengoku Dynasty, the Japan-centric follow-up to Render Cube’s 2021 survival crafting game, Medieval Dynasty.
Sengoku Dynasty is a bit of a cross between a typical survival game and a survival city builder like Banished. Considering how popular both genres have been in the market, it’s not surprising that they crossed eventually. Rather than just try to stay alive in the wilderness alone or with friends, you build up a settlement for NPCs and try to help them survive.
Medieval Dynasty first launched into Early Access in 2020, and was pretty janky at the time. Throughout its Early Access period and afterward, Render Cube worked with the community to sort out all the problems, and now it’s a bit of a beloved fixture.
Sengoku Dynasty transplants that gameplay to feudal Japan. It uses Unreal Engine 5 to replicate the Japanese countryside, offering mountains, cherry groves, and hot springs.
https://youtu.be/3y6YQpU_jck
It’s looking pretty cool. I didn’t play Medieval Dynasty, because I always feel like these games are meant for being played with friends, and I don’t have those. That’s probably not the case for these games. Still, I think the injection of Sengoku-era Japan is just what I needed to grab my attention and get me over my insecurities. I’m looking forward to checking it out.
I don’t have to wait long, because Sengoku Dynasty launches into Steam Early Access on August 10, 2023.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for two whole months now, and it seems that every day more and more people are completing the game's main story quest and getting back to the larger job at hand — which is still torturing Koroks, apparently.
However, some have not been content to finish the game in quite so conventional a way, and have been going back to the final boss to take it on with much more, shall we say, creative methods (thanks, Kotaku). These range from the extremely clever to the downright ridiculous, so we thought that it would be only right to share some of our favourites with you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might not be something you casually peruse while on the toilet
What are you going to do while you wait for Starfield to release? Play the laundry list of games you already have?! Pah! How about something else to keep you occupied for the next couple of months? If you're a stickler for a deep dive into upcoming games, one fan of the upcoming Bethesda RPG may have what you're looking for.
Over on Reddit, user Gokamo has been busy putting a document together that contains as much information on Starfield as possible. Recently, they updated the compendium, which is now over 1,000 pages long. The 86,000-word analysis is a huge one-stop place for all the details about the game you could possibly want. You can check it out on Google Docs.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/14vs3r2/added_over_600_new_pages_from_the_direct_leading/
Gokamo uploaded the first iteration of their "Complete Starfield Compendium" a year ago. At that point, it was a mere 120 pages. Evidently, they've been beavering away on the dossier ever since, and at 1,070 pages in total, it's a visual testament to their dedication.
What's in it?
It's a staggering amount of information to skim. In a nutshell, it's an attempt to detail as much about Starfield as we currently have knowledge on. This includes screenshots, an exploration into the game itself, a deep dive into the reveal footage, concept art, information on skills and character creation, and so much more!
Gokamo says they managed to increase the document by 600 pages in a month due to the recent stream. But even at this point, they seem quite sure that there's some stuff they forgot to include. As user IIIR1PPERIII notes, in a modern gaming era in which strategy guides are becoming a lost art form, this compendium is certainly something that will keep many of you busy up until (and possibly after) Starfield launches.

Sure, tagging is practical, it's helpful, it's kind, but can it really solve problems that wouldn't be solved by slamming a door into someone's face? Of course not. This week, I ask you to pick between risky destruction and precise construction. What's better: breech-loading grenade launchers, or creating construction blueprints?

The build quality, the feel of the mechanical switches, the complete lack of tangible latency… it’s all just lovely. Historically, its high price has been the sole sore spot, but at least it’s joining in Amazon Prime Day with big savings on both the full size and more compact tenkeyless versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope you need some new hardware
Recently, we reported that Starfield was being optimized for AMD. Now, it looks as though Team Red is really digging its heels in by offering the game for free with select CPUs and GPUs. If you need some new gaming tech, hopefully you're an AMD fan.
In a new promotion, anyone who purchases an RX graphics card and/or Ryzen processor will recieve Starfield for free. The specifics are over on the AMD website, but it does provide plenty of options to choose from if you're interested. You can find a full list of participating retailers here.
As you may expect, the tech giant wants to specifically push its latest generation of products. You can get Starfield with a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7, or one of the selected 6000 GPUs. However, if you want the premium edition of the upcoming Bethesda RPG, AMD wants you to consider an RDNA 3 card or Ryzen 9 CPU.
https://twitter.com/amdradeon/status/1678755039865716743
What to expect from Starfield's PC specs
AMD also makes recommendations for what your system needs to run Starfield on PC. It's a triple-A title, so it will test most mid-range rigs.
Running the game at 1080 should require no more than a Ryzen 5 7600 on a Radeon RX 7600 (with an AMD A620 as the recommended motherboard, no less). But if you want that sweet 4K experience, you'll need to part ways with a lot more cash. Fortunately, it doesn't look like you'll need a ninth generation Ryzen, but you'll need the RX 7900 XT, which is a good $900.
There's been no mention of what you'll need if you're using Nvidia or Intel hardware. That said, you may be able to extrapolate based on what Team Red is suggesting. It does seem like a lot of investment to get a free game, but deals like this are not uncommon. In fact, it wasn't that long ago that AMD was giving away Resident Evil 4 with RDNA 3 graphics cards.
Starfield will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.

It looks stunning, and happily the wait for it is almost over, as Tringali and publishers Bithell Games have announced it will be coming to PC on July 25th.

Taito has announced that they’ve got another arcade collection on the way, but this one is extra special. The Taito LD Game Collection not only compiles but also remasters three of the publisher’s classic arcade LaserDisc games: Time Gal, Space Battleship Yamato, and Revenge of the Ninja.
If you’re unfamiliar, these games are essentially interactive movies. The most popular example is the Dragon’s Lair games. You could also look at the various FMV games that came around in the early ‘90s. Essentially, y…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A mix of mobile nostalgia and addiction
Cast your minds back to 2013 and you'll probably be able to recall memories of the phenomenon that was Flappy Bird. For those who don't remember, it was a mobile game that became an unbelievable (if brief) success, possibly one of the most popular iOS and Android releases of its time. Well, now it's back. Kind of.
GitHub user somhi (via Time Extension) has managed to bring Flappy Bird back from the dead. In this instance, it's been ported to the likes of the Analogue Pocket, so the game is once again playable on mobile devices, just not one that many people are aware of.
[caption id="attachment_391327" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Analogue.[/caption]
The Analogue Pocket was released in December 2021. Essentially, it's a handheld gaming system that allows you to play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance titles. No emulation, either. This thing uses the actual cartridges from the OG devices. It's described as the "ultimate tribute to portable gaming" and there are optional adapters for the Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket, and Atari Lynx. Check out our review of it here.
What happened to Flappy Bird anyway?
Given the enormous success of Flappy Bird in such a short span of time, it's a wonder it didn't last much longer. However, it was reported that its creator Dong Nguyen felt guilty about the addictive nature of the game. Although he was raking in around $50,000 a day from ad revenues and sales, Nguyen decided to remove the app from both the Apple and Google stores in February 2014.
There was a version of it released for Amazon Fire TV in August of that year, but for all intents and purposes, Flappy Bird has been dead for almost a decade. If you do miss its simplistic gameplay mechanics and that rush of dopamine, you can always check out somhi's port for the Analogue Pocket, if you have one, that is. Who knows, maybe other versions will come out off the back of this.

As part of yesterday’s ID@Xbox Showcase, Digital Eclipse rolled back the rug to reveal The Making of Karateka. This will be an interactive documentary on the 1984 brawler by Prince of Persia designer Jordan Mechner.
Destructoid’s own Steven “Chunkahunk” Mills covered this as part of his recap on the ID@Xbox Showcase, but I think The Making of Karateka deserves a second look. First released on the Apple II, Karateka made its way to just about every microcomputer under the sun. It was one of the earliest brawlers, made using rotoscoped graphics to create detailed animations rarely seen on early platforms.
[caption id="attachment_391339" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Digital Eclipse[/caption]
Similar to Digital Eclipse’s work on Atari 50, The Making of Karateka will include multiple versions, never-before-seen prototypes, and a brand-new remake of the game. This is alongside developer commentary and behind-the-scenes looks at development. On top of all those things, Digital Eclipse is also providing Deathbounce: Rebounded, a dual-stick shooter based on an unfinished prototype by Jordan Mechner.
Damn! By my calculation, that is everything, including all kitchen appliances and fixtures.
Better yet, The Making of Karateka is just the starting point for Digital Eclipse’s Gold Masters Series. What old favorites would you like to see getting this lavish treatment? Pit-Fighter? King of Kings? Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken!?
While the showcase only announced that The Making of Karateka was coming to Xbox Series X|S, Digital Eclipse has confirmed it is also coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC. The current release date is just “this summer,” but there aren’t that many months left of the season, so we should be seeing it soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not confirmed for Switch yet.
The first entry in Sting's Dept. Heaven series is getting an HD remaster. Making the announcement on Twitter, developer Sting revealed that a remaster of Riviera: The Promised Land is in the works. Platforms haven't been announced yet, but we hope we'll see it come to Switch. (Thanks, Gematsu).
Riviera: The Promised Land first launched in Japan on the WonderSwan Color on 12th July 2002, which means today is the game's 21st anniversary — an apt day for an announcement like this. The West wouldn't get their hands on it until the Game Boy Advance version dropped in 2005 in North America. PAL regions had to wait until the PSP port in 2008.

The studio described the development process as an Icarus situation where the team “flew too close to the sun,” and “were unable to accomplish all the goals” that were laid out in the initial Kickstarter plans, leading to these refunds.


Bulkhead announced plans to refund players last year after cancelling the console ports, although all backers are eligible for a refund regardless of pledge tier, platform, or time played. No questions asked. Backers can find information on how to claim refunds via an email from the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Souls, the upcoming third-person horror game from first-time developer Jukai Studio, will hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this fall. 
Jukai Studio and publisher Versus Evil announced this release window in a new trailer that also revealed Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka will guest compose on the game’s score. And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” 
Check out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. 
Stray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall.

Worldless, which was revealed at last night's ID@Xbox Showcase, is one such Metroidy platformer that's hoping to shake things up with its rhythmic, turn-based battling. I had a sneak peak at its freshly released Steam demo back in March at GDC, and I came away impressed by both its abstract visuals and fluid, dance-like scraps with its angular enemies. The demo is only 30 minutes or so, so why not give it a go for yourself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time to return to Return to Castle Wolfenstein
It's not uncommon for older games to be given a modern facelift. Case in point: the original Half-Life recently got a ray tracing mod, and the new lighting makes the aged FPS look pretty spiffing. Now it's Return to Castle Wolfenstein's time to shine, thanks to an upcoming modification for the 22-year-old title.
As spotted by DSO Gaming, graphics engineer and Twitter user Dihara Wijetunga is currently working on a project that will see the lighting for the 2001 Wolfenstein entry be given a boost. In a recent tweet, the modder uploaded a brief clip from the game showing the path tracing technology that's being implemented.
https://twitter.com/diharaw94/status/1677846492638224385
Those familiar with the original game will see the difference, with bolder light and sharper shadows really giving the titular castle a gloomy look. For those who don't quite see it, Wijetunga's clip handily gives a side-by-side comparison, so you can see how RtCW used to look, and how it will look once the mod releases.
When is Return to Castle Wolfenstein with path tracing coming out?
There doesn't appear to be a release date for it yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on Wijetunga's GitHub portfolio. If nothing else, you can check out their other work while you wait for the mod.
According to the report from DSO Gaming, path tracing for Return to Castle Wolfenstein will not be using Nvidia's new RTX Remix software. Instead, the upcoming modification will be native to the game.
So far, what Wijetunga has done is pretty impressive. It kind of gives you a good sense of just how far video game technology has advanced over the years. It may be more than 20 years old at this point, but RtCW is something of a classic, so it'll be nice to replay it with some visual oomph.

The penultimate set of tracks dropped in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe earlier today, and thoughts online are largely positive. Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass' eight courses contains another selection of series classics and a brand new course, but the GBA track Sunset Wilds has been dominating the conversation for all the wrong reasons — the sun never sets!
Back in Mario Kart Super Circuit, Sunset Wilds was a lovely desert-themed track where, on each lap, the sun would set more. On lap 1, it's early evening and the sky is a warm orange; lap 2 sees the sky go a little cooler, a blend of reds and purples; on lap 3, the sky is completely blue, and the moon sits high in the sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I played a timed early demo of Forever Skies last year, my key question about this airborne Subnautica-like was how it would successfully guide its players across its boundless world of ruined, rusting skyscrapers, overgrown plant tendrils and swampy, toxic clouds. As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? 
Having now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.

Like many people, I find Microsoft Teams is rubbish and it gives me problems every single day. I have never joined a Teams meeting simply by clicking the link. I must always refresh stalled screens, sign back in, repeatedly tell it no don't use the app, or some other technical hiccup. So I've made a game out of it. When I'm trying to join a Teams meeting, I open three tabs for it at once and race them to see which can get in first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fantasy throwback.
First revealed for Switch in the June 2023 Direct, MythForce caught our attention with its first-person roguelike gameplay and Saturday morning cartoon visuals. Originally slated for "Q3" of this year, developer Beamdog and publisher Aspyr have now announced that the game will be coming our way on 12th September, and there's even a new trailer too.
Just in case you missed the announcement last month, MythForce will see you venturing through the crypts and castles of the Cursed Lands in a fantasy dungeon crawl. You play as one of four heroes (online co-op is available), each of whom has their own unique abilities to benefit the roguelike runs from wielding legendary weapons to summoning powerful magic.

The Logitech G432 wired headset is on sale for a solid £35: that over 50% off the list price, so it's a hefty discount for our top pick of the best PC gaming headsets.
We crowned the Logitech G432 for its sublime audio and brilliant microphone, which combine to make it a superlative all-rounder. Katharine gave it a glittering review, with words like "beautifully crisp" to describe the sound, so you know the patter of gunfire will conjure up sensations similar to, say, taking some sizzling roast potatoes out of the oven.

There are points in life that can feel outside of time. Maybe you're leaving one big era of your life behind and moving to the next, or maybe a big decision is causing you to escape, flee, and reassess. It's time enough for the ghosts of the past to catch up to you. And it's those fears and doubts that Night School Studio plays on again with Oxenfree II: Lost Signals.
Night School's follow-up to the 2016 adventure game Oxenfree will feel very familiar. Though it follows an older lead, it deals with many of the same threats. Even its geography will feel familiar, as rather than exploring Edwards Island, you're running around the mainland town of Camena.
For all its familiarity, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals still pulls off some twists, frights, and touching moments. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember playing the first Oxenfree so clearly. The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.
So I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals delivers what I have wanted out of a sequel seven years after the first game's release. Although its overarching A-to-C narrative feels like it is missing a “B” in the journey, I’m impressed with most of what Oxenfree II accomplishes. It brings back the original's simple but charming radio mechanics, adds a walkie-talkie that expands the world around protagonist Riley, and, most importantly, features incredibly well-written and believable characters. While Oxenfree II’s paranormal events are spooky an…]]></summary>

Chiropractic survival city builder The Wandering Village is coming to Xbox One and Series X|S on July 20, 2023. This comes at the same time as its Oceans update, which drops a new biome into the game.
The Wandering Village is a post-apocalyptic city builder where you construct your settlement on the back of a giant creature that carries your people above the toxic surface of the doomed world. It’s pretty neat! You have to appease both your villagers and the creature that they live on in a pretty inventive interpretation of symbiosis. It’s been in Early Access since September 2022, receiving steady updates since then.
The Ocean update adds a new saltwater biome and mechanics based around it. There are new resources and buildings to take advantage of the maritime industry. You can discover islands and shipwrecks, and the Onbu you live on paddles through the water. It’s good stuff.
[caption id="attachment_391248" align="alignnone" width="600"] Image via Stray Fawn Studio[/caption]
I’ve only dabbled with the Early Access at release enough to be able to confidently say that The Wandering Village is a quality game. I also was able to speak to Philomena Schwab not too long ago about the team’s influences.
You’ll be able to check out The Wandering Village on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on July 20, 2023. The Ocean Update hits PC Early Access on that same day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a spiral in your ear
Fangamer has announced that Junji Ito-inspired indie horror game World of Horror will get a physical release for Switch.
You may remember World of Horror as a game that has been sitting in my dubious backlog for quite a while now. It launched in early access back in 2020. It bills itself as a love letter to H.P. Lovecraft and Uzumaki mangaka Junji Ito. It is very “legally distinct” from Junji Ito’s style. Like, this game was developed because no one else was making a Junji Ito game and the developer got tired of waiting, so they made their own. It’s sort of a visual horror RPG.
[caption id="attachment_391230" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Fangamer[/caption]
The physical version being offered by Fangamer is mercifully subdued. I don’t need more giant boxes full of merchandise I don’t use. World of Horror just comes with an instruction manual with an art card. It’s set to ship out October 19, 2023, the same day that it comes out of early access and releases on Switch.
I used to buy a lot from Fangamer back in the day, back when they sold “legally distinct” video game merchandise. I still wear T-shirts I bought from them more than ten years ago. Then the Canadian loonie lost parity with the greenback, so I only buy sporadically now. They’ve gone all legitimate with real licensing, though. I’m so proud of them.
You can currently get World of Horror in its Early Access state on PC. It will be releasing fully on PC and Switch on October 19, 2023. That’s the same day that the physical version will release, but you can preorder now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the ASUS ROG Ally being the first device powered by AMD's new Z1 Extreme SoC with Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA3 graphics, it's been very interesting to see its performance advantages over the Steam Deck. But beyond its potential for use in gaming handhelds, it's quite fascinating to see how powerful the Z1 Extreme actually is when removing power restrictions on this SoC. In this article is a wide range of CPU benchmarks putting the Z1 Extreme up against the new Ryzen 7 7840U laptop SoC as well as prior generation Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U for reference. When adjusting the ACPI Platform Profile configuration, the Ryzen Z1 Extreme proves to be very robust from a low-power SoC delivering good battery performance up through pulling 50+ Watts while outperforming the 7840U.]]></summary>

Capcom hosted a showcase all about their highly anticipated upcoming sci-fi team-based shooter. During the event, Capcom revealed its roadmap for the first three seasons of Exoprimal that includes upcoming content over the next few months. Perhaps the most exciting reveal is two separate crossover events with popular Capcom titles: Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter.
[caption id="attachment_391178" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Capcom/YouTube[/caption]
Months of content is already in the pipeline for Exoprimal
Season 1 will kick off two weeks after release, and Exoprimal will receive its first update with an all new PvE mode: Savage Gauntlet. This mode will rotate tough weekly missions giving players a chance to test out their best loadouts in end-game missions. Rounding out Season 1 is ten new Alpha variant exosuits wielding unique weapons. This update will release on August 16.
In mid-October, Season 2 will add new missions, the Ocean Platform map, and even more exosuits. Street Fighter fans should look forward to Season 2 as it will feature a SF6 crossover collaboration. As part of the crossover, we will get new exosuits based on Ryu and Guile.
Finally, Season 3 will drop early next year featuring even more exosuits, a new Neo Triceratops boss fight, and a Monster Hunter crossover event.  No precise details were provided for this crossover, but we can assume there will be some new giant monsters from the Monster Hunter universe for us to beat up on.
Those looking to save the world from dinosaurs can do so soon. Exoprimal releases on July 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. PC and Xbox players can check out the game for free as part of Xbox Game Pass. The dinosaur-themed game will launch with cross-platform functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received.

What happens when you combine the world's most popular toy brand with one of the most influential first-person shooters of all time? That's right, you get LEGO Half-Life 2. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to take on the Combine or seek the Vortigaunt's help as one of the Danish company's little plastic figures, wonder no more.
The mod is available on the Steam workshop (thanks, PCGamesN) and comes from user Not Dave or Daniel. It's described as a "full conversion" project that basically swaps out major Half-Life 2 characters for LEGO figurines. It seems the modder is aiming to eventually replace all the characters in the game, but the images so far show that a few have already been done.
[caption id="attachment_391138" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Not Dave or Daniel/Steam.[/caption]
Fans of HL2 will recognize the LEGO facsimiles of Dr. Kleiner, Alyx Vance, Father Grigori, and even the mute protagonist himself, Gordon Freeman. The mod is available to download for free now, and it sounds like there are going to be some updates in the future.
So are we gonna talk about..?
Look, it's nearly impossible to talk about Half-Life without mentioning the whereabouts of the long-awaited third entry. It's been 16 years since Episode Two, and it's safe to assume that a new game in the series is not happening. In fact, back in 2017, ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw basically gave away what was likely to be the plot of Half-Life 3, perhaps in an attempt to appease fans who were still waiting.
It's just not coming. We have to accept that. But at least the games that are out are still getting a lot of love. Between the ray tracing version of Half-Life and this LEGO mod, Black Mesa and its inhabitants remain in the gaming consciousness.

This vote creates the largest union in the video game industry. It will cover Sega of America’s Irvine, California branch and more than 200 roles. This comes as part of a continued and long-overdue push by workers in the industry to unionize for better treatment. Just this past January, Zenimax QA workers voted to unite.

Sega is largely a Japanese corporation, but like many publishers, they have offices all over the world. This past February, Sega of Japan actually gave its employees a 30% salary increase, but Sega of America didn’t follow suit. AEGIS has stated that its goals are for pay to meet inflation and for better staffing to prevent overworking.
I’m somewhat surprised that the idea of unionizing has taken this long to catch on in the industry. We’re nearly two decades on from the “EA Spouse” blog that exposed some of the horrible practices of the industry. This mostly involved unpaid overtime, but even after successful lawsuits, crunch remains a commonly used practice across the industry. However, because this is an industry that often attracts individuals and takes advantage of their passion, many workers are afraid to put their job on the line in an attempt to unionize.
Here’s hoping that this trend continues and we see more stories like this over the next few years.

In any case, we'll soon be able to see if that comparison holds up, as Palia is getting a beta on PC next month, so you can test out the wholesome farming, exploring, gliding, and friend-making elements soon. Check out the new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Give it a quick watch before you play the new entry
While the late summer/early fall of 2023 has some pretty killer releases lined up; when it comes to near-future releases, I'm arguably most excited for Pikmin 4. It looks like Nintendo is shaking up the formula quite a bit, and a new brief video tutorial showcases just how that's going to play out in the main fourth entry.
Said video tutorial covers the following game mechanics:
Gathering up your Pikmin (which is still done through an area-of-effect whistle)
Ordering Pikmin to build (chucking them at stuff)
Fighting enemies with Pikmin (chucking them at enemies)
What different types of Pikmin do, as well as the Oatchi
The latter bit is arguably the most important! It reminds everyone that the red Pikmin type is "strong and resistant to fire," blue Pikmin can breathe underwater, yellow Pikmin can conduct electricity [and can be thrown farther], and so on. Rock, ice, and winged Pikmin are also briefly shown off at the tail-end, with no details. But we know that rock-type Pikmin can deal crucial damage in combat (and can break certain walls), ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water, and winged Pikmin can fly/carry objects places some Pikmin can't reach.
Of course, the Nintendo would be remiss to not mention the new Oatchi (dog) mechanic, which is briefly shown at the end. This is arguably the biggest mixup the series has offered to date, and the demo alone offers a ton of strategic possibilities for the concept. You can put this video training to good use when Pikmin 4 launches on July 21, 2023 on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

DRM (which stands for 'digital rights management') has become a sore point for gamers in recent years. Perhaps one of the biggest offenders is Denuvo, which is said to be a major factor in reducing game performance, especially on PC. It's become so controversial that studios have been known to remove the anti-theft software post-launch.
However, in a recent interview with Ars Technica, the Chief Operating Officer of Irdeto, the company that brought Denuvo in 2018, has said they're aware of the reputation the anti-piracy tool has.  COO Steve Huin admitted that "we're seen as evil," in this modern era of gaming, particularly as they are "helping DRM exist," and "ensuring people make money out of games."

Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. 
MGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega Of America employees have successfully voted to unionise under the banner Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS). The new multi-department union represents over 200 employees at the company’s Irvine and Burbank offices, working across divisions including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, live service, and more. Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” 


AEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If - like me - you quickly ran out of storage space on your Steam Deck by downloading 30 games released around 2007 that you'll never play, you'll be on the lookout for a compatible microSD card so you can comfortably download another 70 without breaking a sweat. Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.

Our James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios are nothing if not enablers of wild, unspoken desires. In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).
Choosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.

It's got a hefty 50% discount for Amazon Prime Day, the biggest discount since last year's Black Friday. Can I vouch for it? Yes, I have one! It's light and accurate and does a very good job of skating across my mat like a perfectly tuned puck.
The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a cracking option if you're after a no-nonsense gaming mouse that'll stand you in good stead for anything, really. MOBAs, ARPGs, the likes of CS:GO, all handled brilliantly by the Pixart 3335 sensor. Its honeycomb shell also means it's really light, with an ambidextrous body suited to lefties or righties alike. I wouldn't say the included grip tape is all that useful, mind. Mine sort of peeled off, but I've had no qualms popping my thumbs and fingers on its plastic body.

There is, however, a lick of sense behind it. Sifting through the hundreds, if not thousands of discounted gaming wares is a time-hungry process – just ask Ed and Liam, who I’ve shandhaied into helping this year – and the main Prime Day PC gaming deals hub, the Prime Day graphics card deals hub, and the Prime Day Steam Deck accessories deals hub all tend to get larger but less frequent updates. To say nothing of the Anti-Prime Day deals guide, which also highlights savings on quality hardware from non-Amazon sellers. Keep an eye on this liveblog, though, and we’ll point out the really great stuff more or less as soon as we find it.

With this election won, AEGIS-CWA is now the largest multi-department union of organized workers in the entire games industry, it says.

        <updated>2023-07-10T17:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.
EA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.
EA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.
We'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super serious shooter Arma 3 is leaning into its strengths in the next Creator DLC, called Spearhead 1944, which takes us back to World War II. The Arma series usually prides itself on realistic military simulations - apart from that one kooky expansion that added aliens - so WWII is almost the perfect battlefield for the long-running shooter. 


Developer Bohemia Interactive say we’ll “be a part of the US First Army’s advance as they attempt to break through the German lines,” while using US equipment to “traverse the fields and bocage an all-new Normandy terrain.” Take a look at the impending battle below.

Thus the developers have gone back to the drawing board and are trying to figure out a path forward for better initramfs handling that works well for low-end single board computers while also maximizing space savings and working out well for all Ubuntu use-cases...]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-10T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.
The upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”
Cliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. 
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.
Black Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the second. In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

If you looked at it and went "ooh", your coo lobe was right. "Design a vehicle" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was gone but now am here again to join my co-hosts on this week's Electronic Wireless Show podcast, much like the hundreds and hundreds of of hours of interviews, press briefings and old presentations salvaged by Noclip and heaved onto YouTube. We were going to talk about children's games this week, but given the game for children I was going to talk about was once Stadia exclusive Gylt it seemed a time to talk about the precariousness of digital media a bit (and also make James explain Stadia).


We've all been playing a few games here and there, and most of them are current, with Nate still very enthusiastic about being a dinosaur. James comes with more beans to the hardware altar, and we all have some slightly weird suggestions for your recommendations. Plus, because Liam is actually away this week, I made a special effort to pay attention to audio levels and reduce background noise because I've seen ye all complaining about when I have to edit the podcast and I'm sick of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emile Morel, the creative director of Ubisoft's in-development Beyond Good and Evil 2, died yesterday at 40, it's been confirmed. 
IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Stolar's family.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since played the Gunbrella demo at the Devolver Digital booth at PAX West last year, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it again. I don’t usually go for nails Metriodvanias, but there’s something about Gunbrella’s slick, parkour platforming and scrappy world that made me wanna give it a chance. Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?
The demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.

The debut trailer was full of creepy shape-shifting monsters and evocative cityscapes, but relatively light on concrete details. We now have a clearer picture thanks to a recent dev diary that shows a few pre-alpha clips. Slitterhead seems to have a heavier focus on combat and a cute playable dog. Genuine shocker there.


In-game footage is scattered throughout the video, but the good stuff starts to show up at the 3-minute mark. Take a quick peek:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV’s first season kicks off on July 20, and it’s called Season of the Malignant. Blizzard revealed a new trailer along with details of the content update in a livestream today. 
Season of the Malignant introduces a new questline set after the main campaign in which Malignant Monsters, born from Lilith’s corruption, are terrorizing Sanctuary. It’s up to you and a former priest named Cormond to locate and eradicate the source of this blight. 


Killing these creatures lets players harness their corrupted hearts to transform into new powers. Up to 30 new Malignant abilities are borne from these monsters, and this power can be imbued into Rings and Amulets. This update also introduces a new boss in the form of Varshan the Consumed. Players can also earn six new Unique items and seven Le…]]></summary>

Recent updates have focused on making that world map more interesting and dynamic, including another released today. 

The straightforwardly-named World Events update adds five new choosy, consequence-rich encounters to stumble across, as well as polishing older events, improving the UI, and more.

A new post and a new trailer from developers Arrowhead explaining how Helldivers 2's combat and co-op works is, at least, an opportunity to differentiate itself.

        <updated>2023-07-06T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

A mod that lets you slay hollowed enemies as Tony Hawk is a good guess, but Dark Souls Pro Skater is almost the reverse. A clip went viral over the weekend showing praise-the-sun-guy Solaire shredding around the game’s opening Firelink Shrine. And yes, it looks as cool as it sounds. 


You can watch the clip on Twitter, but if that cursed site’s not working, you can find it on YouTube. There’s also a version that has Shrek shredding but badly, for some reason. Firelink’s ancient, mysterious ruins are transformed into a fun skatepark. Who cares where the skaters came from? Just grind, Gwyndammnit.

This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!
Unpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has formally revealed the first fighter joining the Street Fighter 6 roster post-launch, and it's Rashid, a returning fighter who first appeared in Street Fighter 5. 
Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year. 
While waiting for Rashid to join the roster, read Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 review to find out why we love the game so much, and then check out this upcoming Street Fighter 6 collaboration coming to Exoprimal.

Yes, Nic Cage showed up to announce he’d soon be a playable character in horror multiplayer game Dead By Daylight. And now he is, starting today. 


Nic Cage plays himself, Nic Cage, a role that he’s mastered over the years.

Maybe that comfort comes from a childhood spent playing the genre until 2AM - muffling the sounds of an epic adventure by stuffing my DS under a pillow anytime an adult walked by the room. Enter Sea Of Stars, a love letter to the genre that’s full of both nostalgic charm and fresh new ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”


Of course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday on July 7th, Frontier Development's Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin is holding its first open beta test for its 1v1 multiplayer mode. Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. 
And having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.

Therefore, I thought I'd let you know about a great price for the entry-level Arctis Nova 3, a wired version of the headset that offers the same comfortable design at a lower weight and with support for a wide range of USB devices from PC and Steam Deck (via USB-A or USB-C) to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and more. 
It's currently on sale for $70 at Amazon US, a tidy 30% discount from its original US MSRP of $100 as part of an early Prime Day deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.


It would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.

“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

In an email sent to staff by CEO John Hanke (which you can read here), he explains that the pandemic-era surge of recruitment and expanding pipeline of projects ballooned to the point that, once the pandemic ended, the resulting expenses outpaced its revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.
Wild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license. This means the teams and stadiums of the…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below: 


For more about Disney Illusion Island, watch the reveal trailer from last summer and then check out this gameplay trailer from February. After that, read about the game’s lack of combat and a Metroid-style map.
Disney Illusion Island hits Switch on July 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week on June 23, and less than a week later, Square Enix has announced it has shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies. 
It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

Theorycraft is a relatively new studio made up of developers who, collectively, have worked on franchises like League of Legends, Valorant, Apex Legends, Overwatch, Destiny, and Halo. While the team has publicly talked about Project Loki (not the official title), today’s new trailer marks the first time the studio has shown it in action.
