        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo says it's "always" open to new titles & remakes.
Yesterday, there was a story doing the rounds about a Nintendo shareholder who asked the company if they had any plans to revive past IPs such as the futuristic racing series F-Zero, the RPG Baten Kaitos, and various other titles like Wario Land.
It turns out this question didn't come cheap. Speaking to Business Insider, the individual known as 'Momiji' on social media, revealed how he spent over 5.6 million Japanese yen (over $40,000 USD) on Nintendo stock just to ask Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukwara the question during the company's latest shareholder meeting.

Earlier in June, not long after the release of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, players discovered a bug in the game preventing them from completing it.
As described by a player on social media at the time, a game crash would occur after the Basilisk Crash cutscene when landing on Onderon. Aspyr at the time said it was "aware" of this issue, and advised players to resort to a warp cheat in order to proceed past this point.

After a staggered regional rollout, the "new" PlayStation Plus is available across the board. But is it worth it? And if so, what games should you play? I've got my take.
Subscriptions now range from the most basic and familiar Essential tier (with free monthly games, online multiplayer, and cloud saves), up to Extra (with a hundreds-deep game catalog), and finally Premium (with classics, game trials, and cloud streaming).
I intended to hold off, but when I saw how much it would cost me to upgrade and weighed that against the featured PS1 and PS2 classics, I ended up springing for Premium.

Sega is looking into doing more film and TV, and it's eyeing properties under the Atlus umbrella. A new story indicates Sega is digging into the Atlus catalog for potential live-action film and TV adaptations.
Speaking to IGN, Sega says it is currently exploring live-action film and TV projects with various studios and producers. Toru Nakahara—producer on the Sonic the Hedgehog movies—says Sega is exploring the idea, specifically pointing towards the Persona franchise.
"Atlus' worlds are filled with high drama, cutting-edge style and compelling characters," said Nakahara. "Stories like those from the Persona franchise really resonate with our fans and we see an opportunity to expand the lore like no one has seen—or played—before.
"Together, Sega and Atlus, are working to bring these stories and worlds to life through new mediums and for new audiences," Nakahara says.

Sky's the limit
Sega didn't specify any production companies in particular to IGN. It's only interested in exploring potential projects with various studios and producers at the moment.
It's not like Persona hasn't been adapted before, though mostly through animated series and OVAs. But making it with human actors could get a little weird.
While The Witcher and other series have moved into the corporeal realm with solid results, anime-styled adaptations haven't always fared so well. Look at Netflix's Death Note if you need an example.
Still, video game adaptations continue to be all the rage. Sega has done pretty well with the live-action Sonic movies so far, so there's some earned lee-way in experimenting a bit. Just uh, please don't make a live-action Teddy. The world isn't ready yet.

As spotted by an eagle-eyed Redditor, the MegaCrit Twitter account has edited their bio to add the message "Working on our next game!" It's hardly surprising, given that Slay The Spire came out in early access in 2017, and then as an official release in 2019, but it's always nice to get confirmation.
Before now, the most information we had on MegaCrit's next output was that it wouldn't be Slay The Spire-related, and that they were "working on things", including a not-yet-released Slay The Spire board game. We still don't know much more, except that it's definitely a game.

Atari, (or at least the current iteration of Atari), has announced that it will be releasing an ambitious new compilation that hopes to capture the 50-year history of the legendary game developer. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration will look back at Atari's five decades in gaming, dating all the way back to the birth of the industry itself.
We cannot think of a better way to celebrate our golden anniversary than to share the decades of fun, innovation, and talent with our fans worldwide through this truly remarkable collection," said Atari CEO Wade Rosen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a "punker granny" or a "famous streamer" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.]]></summary>

Inti Creates has announced that the Azure Striker Gunvolt trilogy is headed to Xbox platforms over the coming months. The first title in the hyper-kinetic series will be available to purchase on Xbox One and Xbox Series X today, with its two sequels scheduled to roll out over the summer.
Already available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a fast-paced and highly electrifying platform adventure that found fame as a Nintendo 3DS release way back in 2014. It tells a tale of a highly-skilled, superpowered mercenary, (the titular Gunvolt), who embarks on a mission to eliminate a squad of equally skilled special agents, guided by their mysterious musical muse, Lumen.

Of course, this simple premise merely sets the stage for a dramatic tale of love, loss, revenge, and redemption — set alongside action-packed retro-infused gameplay. This popular release would be followed up by Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 in 2016, which continued the story while offering improved gameplay and other dynamic features. A second sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, is in its final production stages, with a release date scheduled for just a few weeks from now.
Azure Striker Gunvolt is available now on Xbox platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 will launch on July 14, while Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 will arrive on August 2, five days after its 28 July Switch date. The first two titles are already available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch via the Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack.

Sea of Stars is charting a course for next year, rather than this one. Sabotage Studio announced today that Sea of Stars will now release in 2023.
The retro-style RPG was revealed in 2020 as the next project from Sabotage, the team behind The Messenger. Sea of Stars was set for a holiday 2022 launch during an Indie World Showcase last December, but now it's aiming a bit further beyond.
"Keeping in mind our two main priorities—quality of life for our team and quality of the finished game—we can now confirm that Sea of Stars will be released in 2023," today's statement reads.
It's not all bad news for patient fans, though. Sabotage thanks the community for its support and closes off with a note that it's looking into options for getting a "playable slice" of Sea of Stars out to everyone this year.
https://twitter.com/seaofstarsgame/status/1542523812045922311
Sea full of stars
It might be a bummer, but Sea of Stars does seem like it's coming together pretty darn well. Even back in our first look at the project, it was a really cool blend of classic ideas and modern design, like a love letter to the likes of Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.
For the team's health and for the game's benefit, a little extra wait is a good thing. Considering how well The Messenger came together, I've got high hopes for Sea of Stars.
It's not like 2022 is hurting for RPGs either. Just in July, two big games are launching in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and the HD-2D remake of Live A Live. Plus, the newly announced Crisis Core remaster is also aiming for this winter. We've got plenty to play while we wait for Sea of Stars to arrive in 2023.

Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this "insider" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title "Still working on it." The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it's going to be a blast.]]></summary>

If wanting to run Coreboot on a system today it basically means running a Google Chromebook, using an outdated server motherboard or old Lenovo ThinkPad that has seen a Coreboot port, or out of reach to most individuals are various server motherboards that are reference platforms or board designs from hyperscalers. But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their "Dasharo" downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard. I've been trying this out and it has worked out surprisingly well. Here are my experiences and benchmarks of Coreboot/Dasharo on this Intel Alder Lake motherboard.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trials of the Dragon King is out on July 20
It looks like we're getting a Stranger of Paradise DLC pack fairly soon, and it should remind you of some classic 2010s addons. Wait, Stranger of Paradise DLC? Well, there was a season pass for it, so it seems like this was always the plan, as far as Square Enix is concerned.
Although upfront season passes with micro-expansions feels relatively "2010s," the first one is fully confirmed for July 20, as of this week. The publisher has revealed Trials of the Dragon King, which will usher in new equipment, as well as new jobs and challenge missions.
The trailer below gives us a look at a few spoilery boss battles, which seem to be the core focus of the DLC. Two more DLC add-ons will launch at some point later on (likely this year given the short timing window): Wanderer of the Rift, and Different Future. The last one sounds uh, significant, if the title is anything to go by.
If you're interested, you can check out the season pass options here. A Game of the Year edition with some patches and all of the content is really going to hit the spot down the road, for everyone who understandably waited on this one.
Here's a trailer for the new Stranger of Paradise DLC, but note that it does contain spoilers for the main story if you can piece it together:

It looks like 2020's Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris is Switch-bound if a recent retailer leak is anything to go by.
Australian Nintendo community Vooks has reported that EB Games Australia accidentally listed a switch version of Bandai Namco's latest game based on the Sword Art Online anime. There's no specific release date for the game — simply a "2022" window — but as other Sword Art Online games have made their way to Switch, we wouldn't be surprised if this was on the cards too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be an insider to the world of the next Skate
The Skate team is back with a new update, in the form of some very early gameplay and sign-ups. Electronic Arts is letting fans sign-up to be in an early insider playtest for Skate.
In today's video, titled "Still Working On It," the Skate team shows off some "Pre-Pre-Pre-Alpha" gameplay of the new Skate. It's a neat behind-the-scenes look at just what goes into making something like Skate.
Even so, it looks like Skate is coming together quite well. And sign-ups are open if you'd like to see just how well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2XddTE08rI
An early look at Skate
Over on EA's website, the team is hosting sign-ups to be an early playtester for Skate. You can find the registration page here.
Any sharing or capturing of the early playtest is prohibited, and there isn't a roadmap for playtests just yet either. The playtest is only available on PC via Origin as well. It will, however, grow to more platforms as testing expands.
So this isn't the usual open beta or way to get players in and poking at some final systems just ahead of launch. EA stresses that it's still "very early" in the development of Skate, and it wants early feedback to help shape the future of Skate.
The new Skate was unveiled during the 2020 EA Play Live stream, where its developers joked that fans "commented this into existence." While it hasn't been seen much since, the fervor for a new Skate certainly hasn't seemed to die down just yet. Hopefully the new entry can live up to some titanic expectations.

As I said this morning, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is on the eShop and ready to go after a ton of previews, and now you can actually play the game instead of just watching videos on how cool it's supposed to be. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is another significant release this week on the eShop (as well as every other platform Cuphead is available on), as well as the secret release of Portal: Companion Collection (packaging the two mainline games with lots of co-op options for the sequel). Little Noah: Scion of Paradise, Rabbids: Part of Legends, and Yurukill: The Calumniation Games round out the rest of the games Nintendo decided to highlight.
The rest of the offerings are practically non-existent, with one of the lowest eShop release count weeks on record this year: 31 other games. It's crazy that we've gotten to the point where the eShop is so packed (well, that's one word for it) that 30ish games on top of the marquee releases is "low," but typically, there's at least 40 going up per week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's modest, but still a lot.
Nintendo's executives are known for taken home fairly modest sums of money in comparison to their western counterparts. We reported last year that the top three directors at Nintendo - Shuntaro Furukawa, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Shinya Takahashi - between $1.75 - 3 million each when converted from yen to dollars.
Compared to the likes of Bobby Kotick (who, according to NME, earns the equivalent of about $77,306 an hour) and other such western execs, it's certainly not an absurd amount of money, and is probably more reflective of what individuals in these kind of positions are worth. This year, the amount taken home by the directors remains relatively similar; we've once again converted the amounts into dollars, followed by the official results in Japanese yen.

After much fanfare, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is finally out today on June 30, and there's more stuff on the way: including Sunbreak free title updates.
Here's what the team has planned for 2022 and beyond:
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Free Title Update 1 (August)
Seething Bazelgeuse
Lucent Nargacuga (and "several other monsters")
New locale: Forlorn area
Rare species monsters
Special species monsters
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Free Title Update 2 (Fall)
Rare species monsters
Subspecies monsters
Powered-up monsters
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Free Title Update 3 (Winter)
Special species monsters
Powered-up monsters
More "free title updates" (the "s" is key here) are planned for 2023.
So far, Capcom has been teasing individual aspects of each update via livestreams: including their own planned events and the co-opting of Nintendo showcases. If you're a hardcore Monster Hunter fan, you'll be able to glean all sorts of drip-fed info in the weeks to come, as the team slowly unveils more bits and pieces with each subsequent update.
We'll likely see content expansion into 2023 as Capcom tries to increase the sales of Sunbreak and possibly break their internal top 10 all-time seller list, and we could see a new Monster Hunter reveal next year.

Cory Barlog, producer of the upcoming God of War Ragnarok, has once again asked fans for patience in their wait for news of a release date. Barlog made the comments in response to rabid speculation and demands for updates on the highly anticipated sequel.
"Dear all, if it were up to me I would share all the information when I know about it," said Barlog on his official Twitter. "But it is not up to me. so please, be patient. I promise things will be shared at the earliest possible moment they can be. We make games for you. We get to make games because of you."

It's a typically reserved response from Barlog, who has previously proven themselves a master at remaining calm and pragmatic in the face of endless requests and demands. It had previously been suggested that Sony would reveal the launch date during this month's State of Play presentation. It was then rumored that the date would be revealed today, June 30. Given Barlog's comments, however, we are probably still a little time away from receiving news on God of War Ragnarok's elusive release date.
God of War Ragnarok, currently in development at Sony Santa Monica, is the follow-up to the award-winning and critically acclaimed 2018 release God of War. The new sequel will once again see aging warrior Kratos — accompanied by his son Atreus — as they venture through the nine realms on a quest to prevent the arrival of Ragnarok, a cataclysmic event that will bring destruction to the Norse gods and much of civilization.
God of War Ragnarok is currently in development for PlayStation platforms.

Amazon Prime Gaming July is led by the Prime Day main event, but the company just announced a few extras on the way this month.
Here are the big guns in terms of the free Amazon Prime Gaming July titles:
Maniac Mansion
Suzerain
Fishing: North Atlantic
Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark
Beyond that, there's a few other extras (read: not full games but bonuses for existing ones you own, or other free-to-play titles), including stuff for Pokemon Go and Elder Scrolls Online. Continuing their partnership with Blizzard, Amazon Prime Gaming added the "Jewel of the Firelord" transmog item, which is out now. As a reminder, a transmog is essentially a cosmetic item that you can "replace" a piece of gear with aesthetically, but keep all of the original stats of said gear. You'll need to go to a transmog NPC to actually make use of the Jewel of the Firelord, and it'll just appear on your account.
Here are all of the games with bonuses in July:
Brawlhalla
Lost Ark
NBA 2K22
New World
Pokémon GO
The Elder Scrolls Online 
World of Warcraft
Remember, on July 12-13, you'll be able to pick up 30 games, including Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. So sit tight and don't buy some stuff until then if you were thinking about it!
Also, on July 1, all Prime Gaming users should sift through all of the new offerings and start clicking "claim" everywhere they can once the new stuff pops up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel...".
It’s interesting to consider how the role-playing genre has grown over the years, changing expectations around what somebody can expect from one. These days, an RPG usually consists of a relatively big fantasy or sci-fi world, a deep narrative, and a combat system heavily dependent on various numerical values. Gamedec—a new release from Polish developer Anshar Studios—more or less hits those first two specifiers, but there’s no combat or stat points to speak of here. For some, this lack of focus on gameplay may come across as a drawback, but we’d encourage you to try it anyway. There’s a fascinating world to participate in here if you have the right mindset.
Gamedec places you in the role of the eponymous Gamedec—a ‘game detective’—who works various cases tracking down missing persons, solving murders, etc. These cases are all based on the work of Marcin Przybyłek, a Polish author who wrote a five-part collection of original short stories set in a technologically advanced universe. Each case has you jumping between Realium (the real world) and various digital games—like a cute take on Harvest Moon—using a special chair that sends a person’s mind into the game.

The latest Japanese charts are in thanks to Gematsu and there's been a few changes to the line-up this week. First up of course, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has comfortably taken the top spot with a healthy 97,538 units sold, with Nintendo Switch Sports scoring silver at 19,255 units.
Mario Strikers: Battle League sees another drop in sales and falls down to sixth place in the charts, so it's probably safe to assume that the fervour around the title has well and truly died down at this point. It's nice to see Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in the top ten at number nine, and it definitely makes us wonder if any other title here will reach its monumental lifetime sales.

If you try to remove that one, the hook will snag on that pin, so first this pin needs to go but ah! that goes through the middle of this ring, so... it's interesting to understand a shape and system so you can pull it to pieces. Now a sequel is out, and it's also nice, and it's under £2, and it has a demo too.

Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is finally here as a DLC sendoff for the indie darling — and the good news is that it's more Cuphead.
Enough said. Mostly!

Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)
Developer: Studio MDHR
Publisher: Studio MDHR
Released: June 30, 2022
MSRP: $7.99
To make it easier to convey what this expansion-like DLC entails, we'll break things down into two main categories.

A new character (Chalice) and some items
So one big part of the DLC is the addition of items (mostly in the form of charms), and the character of Chalice: a third playable character that's essentially an extension of the charm system.
To be clear, you can "morph" into Chalice as one of the two main characters (Cuphead or Mugma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a very early unlock
A new DLC, a new Cuphead DLC island! While The Delicious Last Course adds a playable third character (Chalice) into the mix on top of additional equipment, the main draw is an extra DLC island with more bosses to fight. The good news: it's really easy to unlock.

You just need to finish the first Mausoleum level
Since a lot of folks are likely starting up a new fresh save file for the DLC (or are buying the game for the first time), I figured it was worth pointing out how to get to the new island.
In short: to access the DLC island in Cuphead, all you need to do is finish the first Mausoleum level. The shortest path involves beating the initial "Run & Gun" (platforming) stage, Forest Follies. It's denoted by a small diamond icon on the ground. After completion (you don't need to get all the coins), a bridge will pop up to the east.
Head over it, then south, to get to the Mausoleum. This one is super easy to complete: you just need to parry (press the jump button while in the air with Cuphead or Mugman) the spirits before they reach the middle of the arena. They move slowly and there aren't that many to defeat.

After that, a ferry NPC appears that brings you to the new Cuphead DLC island
After completion the Mausoleum will crumble, denoting that it was conquered. An NPC will appear holding an oar, and their boat will take you to "Island IV," which is the location of the DLC.
If you load into an existing save file, the NPC should be available to take you to the DLC without an extra step.

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…]]></summary>

In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, "You will die here, and I will live forever." We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, "Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else."
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Back in February, Fire Emblem Heroes was approaching $1 billion in lifetime global player spending. And now, Sensor Tower reports that the strategy RPG mobile spin-off has surpassed that figure, becoming Nintendo's most successful mobile game ever (thanks gameindustry.biz!). It also means that the crossover game is the most successful Fire Emblem game ever.
Heroes is now the only one of Nintendo's mobile titles to pass the $1 billion mark, and it's pretty healthily ahead of the next-best competitors from the Big N — Mario Kart Tour and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp — which have both made around $282 million in global spending.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a triumph ♫.
When it was announced that Portal and Portal 2 would be making their way to the Nintendo Switch as part of the Portal: Companion Collection, fans collectively choked on their cakes. Two of the best puzzle games of all time on the go, you say? Yes, please! Naturally, when certain games get ported to Nintendo’s hybrid system, there’s an accompanying fear that they might not run quite so well on what is effectively a handheld device. Perhaps the frame rate takes a hit, or maybe the visuals aren’t up to scratch. Is this the case for the Portal pair? Thankfully, not at all. Let’s get into it.
The first Portal launched back in 2007 as part of a compilation known as The Orange Box. Despite some criticisms aimed at its short length and limited narrative, the general consensus was that it stood as one of the most original, unique games ever created, and that’s still the case to this very day. While the Switch has seen a number of games take inspiration from Valve’s classic, including Q.U.B.E 2, ChromaGun, and the criminally overlooked Superliminal, Portal is finally available to show the rest of the pack that it’s still the king of first-person puzzlers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I've started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I've played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you'll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it's done ours. I'll warn you now, though. It's a big list.

It's a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it's only an hour or two to complete.

Nintendo's annual general shareholder meeting information was made live yesterday, and while there are the usual numbers and business details dotted throughout, some interesting details have emerged from a discussion that was held during the meeting.
VGC reports (via @NStyles on Twitter) that one shareholder apparently asked if Nintendo had any plans to revive past IPs through new games or remakes. The shareholder then mentioned a handful of titles, ranging from obscure Japan-only games and a big Nintendo franchise that hasn't seen a new game in nearly 20 years.

Sometimes murders happen in the animal kingdom, and who can solve it? Doctor Doolittle is a doctor, not a detective, and Sherlock doesn't speak bee or dog or whatever. So it's up to the animals, and in particular, Lord Winklebottom — a dapper detective who also happens to be a giraffe.
Lord Winklebottom Investigates is a point-and-click adventure game set in the 1920s, with classic irreverent British humour reminiscent of Fawlty Towers and Blackadder and tiny fancy outfits for all the animals. It's made by a one-woman team, consisting entirely of Charlotte Sutherland, whose title credits in the past include LittleBigPlanet 3 and LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga. This is Sutherland's first solo game.

All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

Spike Chunsoft has announced that the murderous cutie-pies that make up the Danganronpa elite are set to bring their summer shenanigans to new platforms. Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp is officially headed to PS4, PC, and mobile platforms, and will be with us as soon as next month.
Originally released on Nintendo Switch in late 2021, Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp is an expanded and revamped version of the "Ultimate Talent Development Plan" board game, as featured in Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. Starring a huge cast of characters pulled from across Kazutaka Kodaka's wild whodunnit franchise, Danganronpa S sees our guys and girls hanging out, fighting monsters, and gathering cool new gear during a vacation on the mysterious "Jabberwock Island."
https://youtu.be/NeGtGEztbNQ
While Danganronpa S boasts the sly sense of humor, cheesecake fanservice, and striking visual aesthetic of its contemporaries, it was chastised for a heavy reliance on grinding, as well as its love affair with tiring gacha and microtransaction mechanics. While our own Eric Van Allen found a lot of fun in seeing all of these famous faces cross over, he also noted that the gameplay required to enable said interactions was repetitive and tedious.
In the eyes of many Danganronpa fans, Ultimate Summer Camp is a wonderful idea on paper, packed out with dream meetings for the series' long-time fans, but the execution is weak. No pun intended
Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp launches on PS4, PC, and iOS and Android platforms July 21. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch as part of the Danganronpa Decadence collection.

But after such a long break since the Wii remake and multiple other spin-offs, what is in Klonoa's future?
In an interview in Lock-On's upcoming fourth issue — which you can pre-order here — the collection's producer, Ryo Ishida, hopes that the upcoming remasters will lead to more Klonoa games in the future (thanks, VGC!).

Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The augmented reality developer is cutting back
Niantic, the company behind 2016's massively successful Pokemon Go, is cutting back. A new report reveals the company is cancelling several projects and cutting jobs.
Bloomberg reports that four Niantic projects have been canceled, including its Transformers game and a collaboration with Sleep No More company Punchdrunk. It's also reportedly set to cut "about 85 to 90" jobs.
Niantic hit huge success with Pokemon Go, the augmented reality game that turned into a summer craze for the ages. Pokemon Go still garners a massive following nearly six years later. Sensor Tower reports that Pokemon Go has now surpassed $6 billion in global lifetime spending, across the App Store and Google Play Store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs
The success hasn't transferred over to every subsequent project, though. Niantic shuttered Harry Potter: Wizards Unite in January, and while Pikmin Bloom is pretty neat, it's also seemingly struggled to bottle the PokeGo lightning.
Walking around the block
In an email to staff seen by Bloomberg, Niantic CEO John Hanke reportedly wrote the company was "facing a time of economic turmoil" and needs to further streamline its operations, to weather any "economic storms" ahead.
"We recently decided to stop production on some projects and reduce our workforce by about 8% to focus on our key priorities," a spokesperson told Bloomberg. "We are grateful for the contributions of those leaving Niantic and we are supporting them through this difficult transition."
The company did recently reveal a new mobile game, called NBA All-World. It's a sports game intended to blend the real world with one-on-one basketball, as well as collecting and fashion. It also has Peridot, another real-world game featuring pet-like creatures, in development. We'll see if these projects can help bring Niantic further out of the storm.

A short demo for the upcoming HD-2D remake of Live A Live is out on the Nintendo Switch eShop right now. And after spending a little bit of time with it, I'm pretty keen on playing the full game.
The demo was announced during yesterday's Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase, allowing fans to get an early hands-on with the July 22nd release. The Live A Live demo also carries save progress over to the full game, so don't worry too much in that regard.
Still, even in demo form, the unique charms and ideas that have made Live A Live a sought-after port for ages really come across. Its demo has short slices of just three of its paths. But just playing them, Live A Live really feels like something Switch RPG fans need to keep an eye on.

Audio diaries — you'll find these little nuggets of storytelling scattered all over a game's world, taking the form of whatever diegetic theming fits best into the narrative. They can be called voxophones, audiographs, audio logs, or straight-up tape recorders, but it's always the same experience. You walk up to an object, interact with it, and you can hear characters talking to themselves, other characters, or even directly to the player themselves. We're going to call them audio diaries for simplicity's sake.
It's one of those mechanics that's in almost every single third- or first-person action game that has any semblance of narrative, and based on who I've talked to about audio diaries, they're a pretty polarizing mechanic at that. Some p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set to launch in 2023
It's hard to believe that Super Bomberman R, a flawed revival of the series, came out five whole years ago, but here we are. It was a Switch launch game even, and over a year later it made the jump to PC, PS4, and Xbox One.  After all these years Super Bomberman R 2 is now a thing, and it's going to launch on basically everything and ring in its own set of improvements.
So this time, Konami is eliminating any of the mystique of a timed exclusive platform. Although it technically debuted during the Nintendo Direct Mini presentation this week, Super Bomberman R 2 is actually arriving on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X devices in 2023.
The big additions for the Super Bomberman R sequel Konami is revealing so far include:
A "castle" battle mode where one person can challenge 15 other players with traps and support characters
A creation mode, which Konami says is "essentially a level editor," that also has a share feature for online play
In terms of what's coming back, the story mode is returning (with exploration sequences, base building, defense missions, and boss battles), as well as the 64-person battle royale mode, grand prix, and standard battle.
For me, the castle mode sounds the most intruiging. It's the kind of thing you'd make up as a kid playing Bomberman for the first time, but never actually get to play. You can watch it in action below, or at this timestamp in the new trailer (starting roughly 0:45 seconds in).

You know, for every kind of business I've (attempted to) manage in simulation games, I'm not sure I've ever been on the hook for an up-and-coming summer camp. Cities, zoos, prisons, and farms, sure, but never a summer camp. Camp Canyonwood is coming to Steam Early Access on August 4, and it'll task us with keeping campers in line, expanding the campground, and exploring mysteries in a Don't Starve-ish world. I'm intrigued.

The best part of the trailer is arguably the end, where it's confirmed that ghosts, UFOs, and other oddities are in the mix. And who's that ominous figure?
Everything up to that point looked fine, in a familiar way, and I'm hopeful that the story isn't afraid to get dark and weird and a bit …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little mouse, big adventures
The Spirit and the Mouse is an upcoming narrative puzzle platformer from Alblune Games, an indie team made up of two developers, Lucie Lescuyer and Alex Strook. Players will take on the role of a mouse named Lila who lives in a quaint French village, making friends with little electric spirit friends and helping out the local townspeople.
The game's trailer shows off the cozy setting, some of the characters that we'll meet, and of course, some gameplay segments of Lila running along rooftops and using electricity powers. The Spirit and the Mouse looks like one of those games that gives you plenty to do, but lets you go at your own pace and chill out, which is a perfect combination in my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5jpnShiiLs
I'll be interested to see what kind of narrative they have going on too, because we didn't get to see a lot of that from the trailer, but I have a feeling it's going to make me feel all warm and fuzzy (and not just because of the electricity). Another highlight from the trailer for me is definitely the music — I love an upbeat, jazzy score, so this might turn out to be one of those game soundtracks I have on a loop for a while.
I also never would have guessed just from looking at it that The Spirit and the Mouse was made by only two people. It looks great and well-polished — we'll have to see what it's like in practice when it comes out later this year. Alblune promises a wholesome, heartwarming experience with this one, and based on vibes alone, The Spirit and the Mouse feels like it might be in the same vein as the highly-anticipated Stray. Either way, we're always in need of more uplifting games out there.
The Spirit and the Mouse is set to electrify us sometime in 2022 on PC and Nintendo Switch, and a demo is available to play right now on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn't going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, "How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?" To which I responded, "Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now." Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Thank you for your support"
New figures from Square Enix claim that NieR: Automata sold 6.5 million units since launch, which was a staggering five-ish years ago.
The announcement comes from the game's official US Twitter account, as well as the Japanese Twitter arm. Both tweets thank fans for their support, while the Japanese one reminds us that the game came out five years ago somehow, and this past February was actually the fifth anniversary (周年) of its release.
Well, it looks like it's going to sell a little more, too, as the company just announced that NieR: Automata is coming to Switch later this year in October. This version will include prior DLC, as well as new outfits. At this point, you have a ton of Switch-only players who are going to bite, as well as double/triple-dippers.
To that end, that same account announced that there will be a five-year anniversary event held on November 25 and November 26 later in 2022. It'll take place at the Tokyo Garden Theater, and there's currently a lottery event so that folks can attend. There's a lot of NieR: Automata news popping up this week all of a sudden! It's always a pleasure to remember that this game exists, and it's still wild to me after all these years to see a NieR/Drakengard-adjacent game getting so much buzz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paid gaming subscriptions to hit record high
Modern gaming subscriptions, such as PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Online, and Xbox Game Pass, continue to rake in millions of dollars each year and are currently set to hit a record number of subscribers by the end of 2022.
According to the number crunchers over at DFC Intelligence, revenue from paid subscription services is set to grow in the second half of the year — with money earned from each service's respective subscribers expected to offset what is predicted to be a weaker winter period for the industry. DFC predicts that roughly a third of the overall revenue for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox will come from subscription fees, rather than straight game sales.
It's difficult to argue against such predictions. The Xbox Game Pass service has all but reignited the Xbox brand in the aftermath of the somewhat submissive Xbox One years. Additionally, the recently revamped PlayStation Plus service is expected to see many users upgrade their standard subscription to the new "Extra" and "Premium" tiers, adding further free titles and access to a library of classic titles.
2022 — and the ninth generation in general — has been tentative for the industry, hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact on the production and distribution of games, accessories, and hardware. Through subscription services, players have been able to receive instant access to a huge variety of new, recent, and old-school releases — for a relatively nominal fee. Much like Netflix and other paid streaming services changed the game for movies and television, gaming subscriptions are fast becoming a major component for our corner of the entertainment industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some fantastic songwriters are on board for this adventure
When Mario and the Rabbids hit the battlefield this October, they'll have some solid tracks backing them. During today's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope showcase, Ubisoft unveiled three well-known composers crafting the tunes behind the battles.
Grant Kirkhope, the BAFTA-nominated composer, is back for the new Mario + Rabbids game. Joining him to contribute to the soundtrack are Gareth Coker and Yoko Shimomura.
Coker accrued many accolades and recognition for his work on the Ori series. Shimomura, meanwhile, is a legendary name in the world of video game music with credits on everything from Final Fight and Live a Live to Kingdom Hearts and, particularly relevant, the Mario & Luigi RPG series. This trio of composers could mean very, very good things for the tunes of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.

A tactical approach
Alongside what looks like a stellar lineup for the music, we also got a look at some more gameplay of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It's still a tactical adventure, mixing action and platforming with a turn-based strategy system.
A few new faces are joining the fray, including the sword-wielding Rabbid Edge, the Rabbid version of Rosalina, and the big lizard himself: Bowser. Bowser was shown in yesterday's Nintendo Direct Mini, but today we got a little more of a look at him and his, uh, Bowzooka?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_NLXtKToHg
With a release date set for this October 20, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is entering a fairly busy fall. But this new adventure looks like a fun, interesting twist on the systems of the first. With even more composer star-power behind it, Sparks of Hope might be one for Switch owners to watch out for this fall.

During yesterday's Nintendo Direct presentation, Bandai Namco revealed that it is developing a remake of the 1999 PlayStation adventure Pac-Man World, starring the company's eponymous mascot and his memorable crew of friends and enemies. Unfortunately, however, it seems that one family member will be conspicuous by their absence.
Pac-Man World Re-Pac, (neat name), will once again see the pill-popping hero on a quest to rescue his family from the villainous Toc-Man, who has not only kidnapped the spherical clan but also chosen to perform this nasty deed on Pac-Man's birthday! What a complete bastard. While the remake will feature a fully revitalized replication of the original 3D platform adventure in its entirety, tiresome red tape will call for alterations to be made pertaining to…]]></summary>

2017's Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game's associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle's success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

So, I sat down with the game's creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a "true adventure". Lo and behold, I think it worked!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Atari's 50th anniversary happening this week, the company has revealed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we've seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry. I went hands-on with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration to see how well it accomplishes that lofty goal.
At its core, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration delivers more than 90 playable games in one $40 package. Players can expect classic and retro titles from six hardware platforms (Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, ST, Jaguar, and Lynx), all with emulation created by renowned re…]]></summary>

You may remember him from such roles as future emperor of the universe Paul Atriedes in David Lynch’s Dune, cafficionado Special Agent Dale Cooper in David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, and for his turn in David Lynch's Oscar-nominated Blue Velvet. Please tell me David Lynch will at least direct the pilot.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/29/creators-behind-star-wars-galaxy-of-heroes-announce-new-combat-rpg-legions-legends"/>
        <updated>2022-06-29T11:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel's Avengers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adata's Premium SSD for PS5 might be the most misleadingly titled storage device on the market. Okay, it is a high-spec SSD suitable for the PS5, but it's also a really good value PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs too. Today, it's down to $185 at Adata's official Ebay store when you use the code FREEDOM15 - an unbelievable price for the level of performance on offer. 
That's some $145 below MSRP and way cheaper than similarly-specced 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the Samsung 980 Pro ($260) or Crucial P5 Plus ($244).

Still, I found myself surprised when I learned that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be an early access game when it launches on September 6th. Watch the latest trailer for the Disney-themed Animal Crossing 'em up below.

        <updated>2022-06-28T16:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.]]></summary>

Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers' exploration-heavy gameplay.

While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today's Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed that we'll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.
Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.]]></summary>

This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you're exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild's paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it's worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level. 
Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.]]></summary>

During today's Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.
The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it's always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.
Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle arrived on Switch in 2017, it was an unlikely success that blended the worlds of Nintendo's Super Mario franchise with Ubisoft's zany Rabbids. The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom's finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft's stable. Announced during Nintendo's E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it's been a while since we've heard anything about that game. That changed today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which shined the spotlight on the company's third-party partners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world's final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier's classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it's been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don't know much else about what appears to be an "ultimate" or "game of the year" edition of the title, but the game's inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn't stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn't ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

"Hosted" is appropriate in the past tense because someone has murdered the now-former leader of Revendreth and the Venthyr. Now there's a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.


Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent's deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.
See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull & Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good & Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.]]></summary>

The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.]]></summary>

Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

Below is an obituary written by Steven L. Kent, author and gaming journalist, sent to Game Informer for use, in full: 
Bernard “Bernie” Stolar, a former top executive at Atari, Sony Computer Entertainment America, and Sega of America, passed away at the age of 75.
“Bernie was a low-key guy. He kept his ego in check,” remembers Vince Desi, founder of Running with Scissors. “I’ve known Bernie for a long time, and I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He was a gentleman in an industry where there really aren’t many.” 
Stolar’s introduction to the video game business came with the 1981 release of an arcade game called Shark Attack. Created by Pacific Novelty and manufactured by Game P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that a Direct Mini: Partner Showcase is happening tomorrow. 
As many have predicted and expected, Nintendo is hosting a Direct tomorrow, but it's not the typical Direct many were hoping to see happen sometime this month to coincide with the rest of the big June gaming showcases. That's because it's a Direct Mini that's also a partner showcase. This means it will be a smaller-scale Direct (see: mini) focused on third-party titles. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we won't see anything from Nintendo's first-party studios because surprises can happen – just don't go in expecting it. 
A new #NintendoDirectMini: Partner Showcase is on the way! Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel beginning Tuesday, June 28 at 6am PT for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party #NintendoSwitch games.

June 27, 2022
Not much else is known about the direct, and there aren't too many rumors swirling around this partner showcase in regards to specific titles or announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because we're less than 24 hours away from this Direct Mini. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about how Shigeru Miyamoto initially cringed when he saw the art style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. 
According to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?'." Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.
“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.'” 
Miyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. 
For more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.

It’s a brutal show, with hilarious satire and multiple wild characters, but it seemingly didn’t hold the interest of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima. 
That’s because he quit after watching three episodes of Season 1, but the reason might have to do with more than just interest in the series. In a new series of tweets first spotted by Video Games Chronicle, Kojima has revealed that at one point in the past (likely 2019, which is when the first season of The Boys aired), he was making something similar in concept to The Boys. In fact, he put it on hold because of its similarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition launched this week, upping the resolution and increasing the framerate of Westwood's ancient adventure game in ways that make it look consistently worse than the original. If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam... Until earlier today, when Blade Runner Classic was added to the Steam version, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach's Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.]]></summary>

In Jurassic World Evolution 2's new expansion, Dominion Biosyn, you play through this corporation's first days and learn how its hunger to bring back never-before-seen dinosaurs takes a turn for the worse.
My time in Biosyn's sprawling dinosaur sanctuary was short yet rewarding. The new campaign flows harmlessly from mission to mission, allowing for success with little pushback. Some dinosaurs get sick or may misbehave, but this is essentially a stress-free playthrough that lets you interact with a handful of fantastic new dinosaurs within just an hour or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jupiter looms large, serving as an imposing backdrop as cargo ship pilot Jacob Lee crashes on the Gas Giant’s second-biggest moon. Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.
Set 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.
In 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[coverage here.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.
When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.

Rather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.
While Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.
Also of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.
Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I'm honest. Even the ones I've enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren't the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it's precisely because it's not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It's not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it's all the more faithful for that.

Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there's plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players' abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 
However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn't free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I'm willing to bet that "pluviophile" would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.

Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.
Regarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year's smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don't have to wait too long to see what it is. When asked whether that other game was still in development, Miyazaki responded, "Yes. Development is in its final stages."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally got our first glimpse of Starfield at the Xbox & Bethesda showcase at Summer Geoff Fest, having seen lots of clips of Todd Howard speaking words with devs who nodded across tables. I partly share the same opinion as Alice Bee, who thought the game could've shown us anything and they chose grey rocks again.
What I wasn't expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game's reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let's investigate.

That simultaneously confirms that Dragonflight's release window is this year, and also threatens Blizzard's staff with the potential for a pretty crappy New Year's Eve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell "Requiem". The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.

Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as "complicated" or "simple". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Ubisoft developer Charles Randall has been spilling the beans about the original Assassin’s Creed on Twitter again. This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

The director's legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company's claims fall flat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I wrote about eco-strategy game Terra Nil’s demo, which went gangbusters during last week’s Steam Next Fest and shot up into the top 50 most played games on Valve’s storefront. Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified "violation of related laws and regulations".

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I've left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2022-06-05</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220605/"/>
        <updated>2022-06-05T09:55:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
