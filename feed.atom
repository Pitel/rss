There's been a lot of conversation in recent times about the price of video games being raised and games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom have even been bumped up to $70.
It seems Capcom is doing the complete opposite with its older library of titles - announcing the 2021 release Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin now has a new price. It's dropped from $59.99 USD down to just $39.99 USD. This applies to the physical and digital versions of the game.

Users on Reddit have highlighted how the hard copy comes with a reversible cover. On the main side, there is the classic Prime box art you probably know and love from back in the day, and on the flip side you can see artwork that was featured in the Japanese announcement. There's also no rating label on this side!

While the N64 was still drinking backstage, preparing itself to stagger out and trip over the drummer, I was drooling over screenshots in various magazines.

Listen, I know that’s not everybody’s favorite game, but this was the first time I saw big, explorable worlds in a video game. I thought every game was one day going to be like that, before someone decided that the only way for a world to be worthwhile is if it was peppered with animals to skin every five feet.
I didn’t even know there was a Pilotwings on SNES until much later. Granted, it can be hard to miss one of the SNES launch titles, but I was four at the time of the SNES release, so cut me some slack. I only found out about it year…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tank you very much
After spending several weeks in the land of Taito, retro purveyor Hamster is taking another trip into Namco's past, with the arrival of the obscure cyber-tank battler Grobda, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1984, Grobda is a side title in the Xevious shmup series, and sees one of the enemies of that game repurposed as a mighty battle tank. Essentially a futuristic version of the golden age Atari game, Combat, Grobda sees players control the titular tank against a battalion of enemies in top-down, maze-driven action. The player must utilize the Grobda's laser weaponry to destroy their opponents while dodging return fire across a gauntlet of 99 stages.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAXdlXLPlRQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming
Having launched just on the verge of the Video Game Crash, Grobda would swiftly vanish into the void, though home versions were developed for Japanese platforms such as the Sharp X1 and the NEC PC-6001. Grobda development team featured some notable Namco luminaries, including Tower of Druaga designer Masanobu Endo, and Dig Dug composer Yuriko Keino. Always a pioneer, Keino devised a mechanic that allowed Grobda to speed up her score as the action heated up, a fun little gimmick for the time. Development was smashed out in a mere three months from conception to release. Wild days.
Grobda is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

With Destiny 2: Lightfall releasing on February 28, the game is at its most exciting point yet. Lightfall is the franchise's penultimate expansion in the Light and Dark saga, meaning this story arc will soon be coming to an end, but there are plenty of loose threads to tie up before then.
On February 16, Bungie shared a 16-minute video documentary that gave fans of the series a deeper look at Lightfall and what comes next. There was plenty of information to sink our teeth into, and we'll dissect the Lightfall ViDoc and bring you all you need to know about its contents.

I tried the demo of Mahokenshi a long while back and came away impressed, yet somehow the final release still snuck up on me. Its mix of board-game style, turn-based, card-centric gameplay felt rather powerful in my first experience, so I was excited to see how the whole package turned out.

I’ve made it clear by now that ranking games in a franchise or a system’s library is not easy. Even if these rankings are subjective, deciding which games are “best” wracks my brain for hours before I finish a rough draft. This is why I do not say lightly that all my lists to this point pale in comparison to the difficulty of ranking the best SNES games.
Lord Spencer elegantly described my 10 best Mario games list as “a list of nines rolling into tens.” As I jotted down my picks for this list, I realized they were all potentially tens. The SNES is so jam-packed with incredible titles that we upped the count to 15 to represent it. This is a system where legends were born, franchises were codified, and memories were made magical.

Ghost Ship Games, the independent developer behind 2018's smash hit Deep Rock Galactic, has announced that it has founded a new publishing wing, named, naturally, Ghost Ship Publishing. The new label is the next step in the evolution of the studio, following its purchase by Embracer Group in 2021.
"Becoming a publisher is a way for us to give a bit back to the industry, and to help lift up both the Danish gaming scene and other small developers like ourselves across the globe," said CEO of Ghost Ship Games Soren Lundgaard in a press statement. "Our goal is to assist fellow developers with funding and marketing expertise, while also helping them establish a solid business. Founding a publishing brand is a passion project for us, and we are very excited to make this a reality.”
https://twitter.com/GhostShip_Games/status/1626153169255297024?s=20
"Starting a publishing company is a natural next step for Ghost Ship," adds CCO Mikkel Martin Pedersen. "We love games and the success of Deep Rock Galactic has now enabled us to help other developers create theirs. We can’t wait to get started."
Ghost Ship Publishing is believed to already have several titles waiting in the wings for release in 2023 and beyond. The new label will work with independent studios in order to help conceive, finance, and release their respective projects. Ghost Ship Games was originally brought under the EMbracer Group banner in August 2021, as part of a huge acquisition period that also saw the holding company pick up 3D Realms, Easy Trigger, Slipgate Ironworks, CrazyLabs, and several other fledgling studios.

Updated with Fashion Police Squad and Metroid Prime Remastered. Enjoy!

Nintendo Switch's bulging catalogue of games covers practically every genre, and First-Person Shooters are no exception. It's a welcome change because Nintendo systems have historically lagged a little behind other consoles in the FPS field despite hosting some classics. After all, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark helped define the FPS on consoles, and the Metroid Prime series shifted the exploration of the 2D Metroids into a first-person perspective to great effect. Still, Nintendo consoles have often missed out on the best multiplatform shooters.

Though Pokémon Scarlet & Violet already gave us mice for Valentine’s Day, it hasn’t slowed down in rolling out its weekly Tera Raid spotlight events. Case in point: Garchomp and Sylveon are currently featured as blue star Tera Raids from now through February 19th.
If you’ve been following these events as they’ve gone live, you know what to expect. Garchomp and Sylveon will have boosted appearance rates in Tera Raids at either 4 or 5-Star difficulty. They will spawn as any Tera Type in the game, so it’s impossible to choose a dedicated Pokemon to counter them like in 7-Star raids. That said, Sylveon will more commonly appear with the Fairy Tera Type, while Garchomp will commonly sport the Ground Tera Type. These events typically don't boost the the appearan…]]></summary>

A big, heavy Pokémon deserves a big ol' plushie, right? That's obviously what The Pokémon Center thought with Wailord, who has a big of a reputation among Pokemon fans for its size.
Well, it's a whale, so it should be big, right? Right. So it makes sense that you can buy a 57 ¾ inch-sized Wailord plush — that's just shy of 1.5 metres, by the way. That's 1/10th of the size of Wailord itself, so if you buy ten, then you can get an idea of just how big is. So what we're saying is, yes, a plushie could squash you.

Survival town-builder Outlanders is the latest game that will be leaving Apple Arcade to plant roots on new platformers. Pomelo Games' builder is dropping on March 7, 2023.
First released on the iOS Apple Arcade in 2019, Outlanders is a survival town-builder, a genre that has been growing in popularity since Shining Rock Software’s 2014 hit, Banished. Since then, the formula has been expanded by games like Frostpunk and Settlement Survival. The focus of these games is on resource management, as your townsfolk suffer from a fatal condition known as mortality. Fail to keep them fed and healthy, and they will succumb to their diseases.

Outlanders attempts a more relaxed approach, but you’ll still be tasked with filling hungry bellies. It has a narrative campaign that has you follow the paths of various leaders. There is no combat, but the media around it shows construction near a volcano. Like other games in the series, you manage the workload of the town’s inhabitants, and you can pass decrees to work the ungrateful peons to an early grave. Improvements have been made to the UI and graphics to make it better suited to the good old mouse and keyboard setup. A sandbox mode will also be available if you do better without having to worry about goals or expectations.
Outlanders is currently available on iOS via Apple Arcade, and will be coming to PC on March 7, 2023. There is currently a PC demo available on Steam if you want to kick the tires.

I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's lonely out in space...
Epic Games Store has revealed the next game that it will be offering up to its community of customers free of charge next week — And for our next freebie we'll be looking at the desolate sci-fi strategy title Duskers, which will be available to download by all from February 23.
Developed by husband-and-wife indie studio Misfits Attic and released way back in 2016, Duskers sees players managing a small squadron of drones as they attempt to locate, explore, and salvage a series of lonely and haunting derelicts in the deep regions of space. The gameplay in Duskers is two-fold, with players tasked with maintaining, upgrading, and micro-managing their drone units, before taking them out into the field, where they are controlled with rudimentary commands in a very "classic sci-fi" manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dux33m_7M6w&ab_channel=MisfitsAttic
It is the players' duty to maintain the drones' well-being, both on and off the field. This includes helping them to negotiate environmental hazards, avoid malfunctions and fuel loss, and ensure that the drones are kept routinely repaired and ready to rock from sector to sector. It's all very Silent Running, from a technical and aesthetic standpoint — Though I do not think Duskers features any actual gardening. Duskers would be critically acclaimed for its design and atmosphere on launch, even bagging several independent game awards and nominations.
Duskers will be able to download from Epic Games Store from February 23 until March 2. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Warpips, before its removal on Wednesday.

Nintendo's most recent eShop sale in Europe, dubbed 'February Fest', features a metric boatload of brilliant games — so many, in fact, that it's easy to get a little lost in all the quality. Sure, it's pretty easy to short the shovelware from the silverware, but with such a bounty of riches, it can be difficult knowing where to start with the good stuff.
Fear not, for we are here with a helping hand to point you in the right direction. In this list, we've collected every game on sale that we've reviewed and awarded a 9/10 or higher. There are plenty of great 8/10s available too, but we've stuck to what our reviewers considered to be the real cream of the crop. We think you'll agree that over 80 games is probably enough to be starting with!

Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

"I’m embarking on a new chapter; however, I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to fulfill my dreams at Firaxis Games,” said Solomon in an official press statement. "I’m thankful to everyone who enjoyed XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns, and to my development and publishing partners who helped bring those games to life."
In a separate message posted to Twitter, Soloman teased that his "Brain was on fire w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

Like a Dragon has seen its main series' star continually rise in the west, and now we're getting a remake of one that never managed to make it over. Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a remake of the 2014 game, tackling historical fiction through the lens of its characters, humor, and action.
While the anachronistic premise can and does lead to some outlandish moments, the good news is that for the most part, Ishin comes together well. Aside from technical hitches and some tedium in the main story, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is an enjoyable romp through history with all the bizarre slice-of-life moments and dramatic fights you could want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

According to Bloomberg's data, this puts the PIF holding ahead of Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund stake in Nintendo, and comes second only to Nintendo's own shareholding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31.

Today brings news of a new studio entering the world of video game development — Wildlight Entertainment has been founded by a party of developers, almost all of whom have previously worked with Respawn Entertainment on major league titles such as Call of Duty, Titanfall, and Apex Legends.
In fact, the key founder of Wildlight Entertainment is Apex Legends' original game director, Chad Grenier, who announced the launching of the new studio on Twitter yesterday evening. Grenier heads up a team of over 10 individuals, all of whom have taken their leave of Respawn within the past two years. These include CEO Dusty Welch, project lead Mohammad Alvali, engineer Justin Cook, lead designer Carlos Pineda, project manager Amelia Duarte, and art director Robert Taube.
https://twitter.com/ChadGrenier/status/1626271511748435974?s=20
Currently working in a remote capacity, Wildlight Entertainment has physical offices established in both Los Angeles and Seattle, and is already hard at work on its first title: a brand new, yet-to-be-revealed IP. While the pertinent details are on the hush-hush, one can only assume that the team behind Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and Titanfall will be looking to deliver a highly polished action title, perhaps with a similarly sci-fi/futuristic slant.
You can read more on the company and its team over on the new Wildlight Entertainment website, or follow the studio on Twitter for updates, job vacancies, and more news and info. For action/shooter fans, this will definitely be one of the developers to watch in 2024 and beyond.

That's Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare. But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A small slice of Ryoma's swordplay
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is not far off from launch. But if the wait's just a bit too long, there's a demo for Ishin out today so you can get a taste of the new-old combat.
The "Combat Demo" is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The two-part combat demo covers a roughly 20-minute section of the game, specifically spotlighting the combat of Like a Dragon: Ishin, which sees Ryoma bringing his sword, gun, and fists to bear against foes.
The slice of Ishin covers both a brawl at Kiyomizu temple and a face-off with some armored foes. This demo looks to spotlight not just the fighting, but what enemies are bringing to the table to try and stop Ryoma. If he's anything like his supposed descendant, though, there's not much that can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE
Sega and RGG Studio have also revealed a special "Dragon of Dojima" skin, that will make Sakamoto Ryoma look just like Kazuma Kiryu, suit and all.
Heading back to an older era
Ishin is a remake of the earlier entry in the series, one which we never saw ported over to the west. It's historical fiction, using the likenesses of many Like a Dragon series characters, but with different names, playing figures from the time in dramatized versions of the events.
Still, just because Kiryu is actually Ryoma, doesn't mean there isn't some classic Like a Dragon to get up to. Alongside the brawling you can see in the Ishin combat demo, there's also the usual substories and side-games you'd expect from the series. Plus, an Another Life section where Ryoma can live it up as a peaceful farmer. What's not to like about a slice of farming life inside this classically action-heavy series?
Like a Dragon: Ishin! goes live on Feburary 17 for Deluxe Digital pre-orders, and on February 21 for every other version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understandable
Frogwares has announced their decision to delay the release of the detective adventure Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. Initially, they had planned for the game to be out the door by February or March, but now they’re predicting it could land as late as April.
Frogwares has released a video to go along with the announcement to outline the difficulties they have been having. The developer is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and because of the Russian invasion targeting the country’s energy infrastructure, the team has had trouble maintaining a work schedule. The video also outlines how some members have to alternate working remotely and in office, depending on which site has power at the time.
https://youtu.be/d5XiUNnjp-4
While I haven’t played any of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes titles, I have gotten into The Sinking City, which I mostly enjoy. I’m mostly held back by the fact that I’ve never read any of the novels. Frogwares started their adventure series based off Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories back in 2001. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a full remake of their third game, released back in 2007. They’ve been at it for a long time, and the series has gained its share of fans.
Frogwares isn’t the only developer trying to put together a game during an invasion. Much of Digital Dreams Entertainment, developers of Mutant Football League, are trying to create a sequel to their Football title. Likewise, GSC Gameworld is still pushing toward a release for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and has already had to delay it for the same reason.
Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in March or April.

It's down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall 'fastest SSD' recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

Immortal Empires merges the worlds of all three Total War: Warhammer games into one giant map, complete with every faction released across the series.
February 17th marks a full year since the launch of Total War: Warhammer III. During that time, the team has been plucking away at the Immortal Empires mode within it, providing it to players to collect feedback on. They’ve made tweaks and additions, such as end-game goals, and now it’s time to see it in its completed glory.

Some fucking sadist has chosen absolute chaos, and developed an edition of 2020 spider-hunting title Kill It with Fire for the VR market — Yes, you can now "enjoy" the destructive, terrifying, hide 'n' seek nature of the Man vs. Arachnid release in fully immersive virtual reality fashion. Thanks?
Kill It with Fire VR will recreate the over-the-top action of the original release, as players search a variety of locations including houses, gas stations, farms, and, of course, bathrooms for the eight-legged critters. Track down a menagerie of creepy crawlies, before engaging in mortal combat with an arsenal of household implements, ninja weapons, firearms, and other super bombastic weaponry. The virtual reality edition of this absolute nightmare will utilize a new "VRACHNID" mechanic to allow for better detection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLtBfOARzM&ab_channel=tinyBuildGAMES
"Fans have been asking for a VR version of Kill It With Fire since the very first footage of the original game," notes Casey Donnellan, solo developer of Kill It With Fire and thus a monstrous person. "I'm really happy that we can finally put horrifying spiders on a screen less than an inch from players' eyeballs!"
All jesting aside, I actually really like spiders. Oh, I'm pretty scared of them, and one actually bit me last year, (always shake out your shoes, folks). But I do think our scuttling pals are pretty darn cool, as well as being fascinating, intelligent, and important creatures. Anyway, Kill It with Fire VR is scheduled to launch "soon" on PlayStation VR 1 & 2, SteamVR, and Meta Quest 2.
I'm probably going to assign the review to CJ Andriessen. He'll love it.

34BigThings has announced that it's dropping its loose interactive adaptation of Roberto Saviano’s novel Gomorrah today. The plot seems unconnected with either the book or the 2014 Italian TV show of the same name, instead utilizing a similar crime drama approach to the narrative.
In Gomorrah, you take the role Nina Miniero, the daughter of a Naplese crime boss. After Nina’s 18th birthday party is attacked and her father murdered, she takes the reins of the crime family and drives it on a collision course with revenge. You lead the family through various procedurally created missions, making each playthrough different. There are eight possible endings that you’ll reach based on your choices.
Gomorrah is presented largely as a choice-driven visual novel with visuals crafted by comic artist Luca Negri. Gameplay is largely resource management and decision-making. The team has stated that they weren’t able to work with author Roberto Saviano himself, but a screenwriter from the TV series provided some guidance.

I really enjoy the visual style of this game, and it sounds like an interesting experience. Something about it is giving me pause, however. I definitely don’t mind more menu-heavy gameplay, but it might just be that I’m not that big into violent crime drama. I’m familiar with neither the book nor the TV show. Still, at release, Gomorrah will run for $3, so it’s not a big investment if you want to take a peek.
Gomorrah is available today on PC, iOS, and Android.

Sega and Ryu ga Gotoku Studio are currently gearing up for the launch of Like a Dragon: Ishin! A full remake of the 2014 spin-off title in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series of action-RPGS — And speaking of yesteryear, the studios announced that a special DLC skin is included in Ishin's Deluxe Edition, which sees the return of the eponymous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu!
The "Dragon of Dojima" DLC will allow players to dress Ishin's hero like his centuries-later descendant, complete with his iconic silver-grey suit and snakeskin shoes. It should be noted that this is just an aesthetic skin, Sakamoto will not literally become Kazuma — But if you fancied turning the attractive, period-piece world of Edo Japan into an absolutely dreadful anachronism, then you're sorted.
In this short trailer, you can see Sakamoto looking slick as he gets his ears cleaned out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE&ab_channel=SEGA
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a full remake of the 2014 PS3 release of the same name, and follows the adventures of Ryoma Sakamoto, who becomes embroiled in a local war of houses while investigating the murder of his sensei. Like a Dragon: Ishin! continues the hard-boiled drama, violent action, and a little of the tongue-in-cheek nature that is the trademark of the Like a Dragon series, but never saw the light of day outside of Japan, with Sega concerned that the game's setting and characters might not localize well enough to warrant the effort .
One should remember that the series then was not the highly recognized brand that it has become today, specifically since the launch of 2015's Yakuza 0, which was a huge hit on the PS4 platform.
Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches February 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gluttony ho!
XSEED and Marvelous Europe have announced that they will be publishing BattleBrew Productions’ dungeon-crawling cooking title, Cuisineer, this summer. If you’re planning on watching the trailer, I feel I must warn you: it might make you hungry.
Cuisineer will combine the horrors of the food-service industry with the pleasures of dungeon crawling. Playing as cute-as-heck aspiring chef, Pom, you will plumb the dark recesses of the world for ingredients to serve to your customers. You’ll weaponize your utensils to take on bigger, badder bosses in an effort to build the best recipes for your discerning customers.
I’m sorry, I’m a bit distracted here. I keep looking at the food.
[embed]https://youtu.be/vSxgdxR1_5s[/embed]
Beyond ingredients, dungeon diving will net you gold, items, and additional recipes. The dungeons are procedurally assembled, giving you something new each time you plumb them. As you gather wealth and renown, you’ll expand your restaurant so you can serve more customers and thereby gather even more wealth and renown.
This is cute. This reminds me of 2010’s Recettear in its combination of dungeon diving and business management. The gameplay loop of setting out into the world and returning to reap the rewards is an addicting one. Better yet, I’m enamored by the graphics. Not just the food, but just the bright colorfulness of its all, its chibi characters, and the pleasant-looking towns. Also, the food. I’m not hungry right now, but the way the highlights are drawn on those meals makes me want to eat and deal with the consequences later.
Cuisineer will be coming to PC in Summer, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where's my gurl Juri at?
Here's a delightfully nostalgic piece of memorabilia — Capcom has partnered with merchandise maker Big Shots to produce a series of rough 'n' tumble plush toys based on some of the World Warriors of its iconic fighting game series, Street Fighter.
The initial Street Fighter Big Shots line features eternal rivals Ryu and Ken, as well as the All-American Guile, and the Brazilian beast Blanka. Each Big Shot is packed with premium polyester filling and printed on soft velvet polyester cover. Each character is available in two sizes — 22" x 19" or 16" x 14" — and weighs 1.5 lbs or 16 ounces, respectively. Either way, they're built to take a kicking, so you can practice your Shoryukens until the cows come home.

Of course, fans of a certain age will no doubt be instantly reminded of the massively popular WWF Wrestling Buddies of the late '80s, which saw similar toys made of stars such as Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Jake "The Snake" Roberts, and "The Million Dollar Man" Ted Dibiase. I personally never had one myself, but I remember them being around in abundance.
So, Big Shots, drop a Juri and I can finally make up for lost toy time. 42 years old.
The Street Fighter Big Shots are available for a limited time over on the official Big Shots website. The 16" versions retail for $49.99 USD, while the 22" version retails for $69.99, not including shipping charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plus, two other Forge spinoffs have windows
Riot Forge, the publishing arm for spin-offs of Riot Games' League of Legends series, has locked in another game set in Runeterra. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story is an action RPG following League of Legends champion Sylas, developed by Digital Sun, and arriving this year.
The Mageseeker will see players take control of Sylas, an escaped mage in search of vengenace and looking to take it out on Demacia. It's a 2D action RPG where Sylas and the player will raise a mage army and eventually lead a revolution. Digital Sun, the tema behind merchant RPG Moonlighter, is making The Mageseeker. It's set to arrive in spring 2023 for PC and console.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66QyujLXyg
Additionally, the Riot Forge locked in release windows for two other projects. Song of Nunu, a character-action game from Tequila Works starring Nunu and Willump, is aiming for fall 2023. And Convergence, a single-player 2D action platformer starring time-bending champion Ekko and developed by Double Stallion Games, arrives in summer 2023.
Fanning the Forge
Riot Forge covers the ongoing third-party efforts to expand out the world of League of Legends. Games have been steadily rolling out of it, too; we've already seen the likes of auto-runner Hextech Mayhem and the Airship Syndicate-developed RPG Ruined King.
All the while, Riot Games is also crafting its own dive into the world of League of Legends. The fighting game Project L sits somewhere on the horizon, and other projects lurk around. Add on the likes of Teamfight Tactics and the successful Arcane series, and it feels like League of Legends has expanded far beyond its MOBA bounds at this point.
That's probably a good thing, for those who dug stories like Arcane but aren't keen on playing some 5-on-5 in the Rift. We'll see what the Forge has in store as more of its projects roll out throughout 2023.

Tales of Symphonia Remastered is going to be a big deal for many other RPG fans, as is Digimon World: Next Order. Those come out on February 17 and February 22 respectively. Other than that, there's the typical 40+ game eShop dump, so be prepared to once again sift through a ton of stuff to get to something you want.

Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says "it's pretty tough - you've been warned". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

It’s hard to believe Flying Wild Hog’s Shadow Warrior games started off as a retro revival of the 3D Realms’ 1997 Build Engine title. While the 2013 game made references to the original, it was very much its own thing. Then I skipped the second title because it would make me feel lonely to play it by myself, and now we’re at Shadow Warrior 3, and it’s unrecognizable.
That’s where we were last year, I guess. This is Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition.
The Definitive Edition comes with survival mode and a new game plus, but otherwise, it’s the same Wang. I haven’t gotten intimate with this Wang yet, so thankfully, my experience will never not be definitive.

In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension.

In 2021, McGee released the first draft of a script, and now he’s back with a 414-page design bible, the announcement of a partner studio, and an odd plea to EA.

So while other outlets will be delivering their final verdicts on Omega Force’s beast batterin’ simulator today, I’m afraid I haven’t had the chance to play enough of it to give it a fair shakedown yet. It’s good, though! I really like it, and as a huge Monster Hunter fan I’m pleased that there’s finally a worthy alternative to Capcom’s long-running series. Competition is good!

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.
Call of the Mountain features a perfunctory cameo from Aloy to remind you that you are in her world, but this gam…]]></summary>

What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

This month’s list of leavers includes a few heavy hitters, like the horrifying Alien Isolation, and a duo of big JRPGs that are likely impossible to binge in just two weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild Hearts developers Omega Force are looking to lower the blades of disgruntled PC players, penning a Steam news update that acknowledges performance issues with the early trial of their Monster Hunter-y RPG.


"Omega Force are working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game for a wide variety of hardware specs across future updates", the note reads. It also confirms that support for both DLSS and FSR upscalers is on the way, and asks those who’ve found their hunts scuppered by dodgy performance to report their issues to EA’s support team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loathe as I am to become one of those "want to feel old?" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the "A New Era" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

Happily, as part of RPS Magic Week, I've had the opportunity to speak with Florian Mann, CEO and co-founder of Spells & Secrets development team Alchemist Interactive.

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil is terraforming sim, in which you land on a barren wasteland, construct machines for restoring it to a lush, green wilderness, and then pack up your toys and leave. It's one of the games I'm most looking forward to in 2023, and its latest trailer just cements that. It's three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the "satisfaction in reclamation".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.

You're part of a small coven with your three friends, and you all meet online every night to chat about school, shitty part-time jobs, and of course, witchcraft. At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.

The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo's in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

It's one of those classic, age-old moments where you're suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that's still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda's oeuvre in all the right ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, "It's a no from me".

And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

“Here is what may be the final edition of Blood Bowl,” read the opening page of that community manual. “This is the rulebook designed to send Blood Bowl into a perpetual format. The Games Workshop is no longer interested in providing true support for this game.”

I can't get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.

It was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I've had a great time watching the first three so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For three hours, Re:Call was high on my list of surprise recent indie hits. It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the 'correct' solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe it's because I've been bouncing between a lot of weighty games lately, but I've found a great diversion in The True Slime King, a simple three button platformer that recently left early access.

Speaking pedantically, this isn't "as simple as it gets", but you'll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I've played enough to realise I'm partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Division 2 has enjoyed a long life since its 2019 release, but it seems like the looter shooter has finally tripped. Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I imagine Industries Of Titan started out as an ambitious concept. A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it's incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

It's meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Razer's Nari Essential headset is a nice wireless option, with oversized and super-comfy ear cushions, a THX spatial audio certification and a relatively sturdy design. It retailed at $100, half the price of the ultra-premium Nari Ultimate, but today it's significantly cheaper at Best Buy. You'll pay just $35 for it now, a $65 discount and a great deal for an older but still great-sound wireless headset.

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

Alongside the trailer, however, Nintendo also released a new batch of official screenshots which features a collection of alternate paragliders alongside other details. The new paragliders are apparently related to the game's amiibo compatibility which according to a press release, "Will also be available separately that grants access to materials and weapons, as well as a special fabric for Link’s paraglider." You can check out some examples in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon got its first gameplay showcase after its reveal at the Game Awards last December. This storybook-themed adventures stars a young Bayonetta on a quest to free her imprisoned mother.
Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won't be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she'll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles.

That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn't happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay "in light of recent world events," perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It's being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.

The news comes by way of today's Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It's up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.
We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.
Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.]]></summary>

Those were the words of Capcom's Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through.

The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don't know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken players still exploring Athia or those hoping to jump in the future should be happy to know that developer Luminous Productions has announced an impending patch to make the adventure smoother across the board. 
In a statement by game director Takeshi Aramaki, the update will improve Forspoken’s graphics, performance, and playability while also adding “general updates” and fixes to both the PS5 and PC versions. There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. 
“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
Forspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.
This new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.
Perhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.
You can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.


Cities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.]]></summary>

Deliver Us Mars follows in the footsteps of hidden gem Deliver Us The Moon, a game with enjoyable puzzle-solving and storytelling that mostly overcame its technical and presentational shortcomings. The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.   
Despite being a direct sequel, you don’t need to play Deliver Us The Moon to grasp Mars’ plot. Earth has spiraled into an irreve…]]></summary>

Tune in at 2 p.m. PST tomorrow, Feb. 8, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023.
https://t.co/8ce3reaEig pic.twitter.com/Pmf41dQWIw
February 7, 2023
The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it's always possible they'll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow's Direct? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of "girl games".
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM's new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
The first five games by Japanese indie developer iTA-Choco Systems.
