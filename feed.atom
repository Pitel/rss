        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The history of gaming is written at a brisk pace. Not too long ago, LucasArts and Sierra fought it off for the throne of the adventure game kingdom. Nowadays most gamers don't even recall what a classic point & click game is, let alone that Sierra and LucasArts even existed. 


Let's freshen up everyone's memory with some of the best adventure games ever made by what I believe was the best adventure game studio to ever exist.

Loom (1990)


Loom is the black sheep of LucasArts' adventure catalogue, but it's not a bad game. It features a very experimental take on point & click gameplay, and it's one of the very few LucasArts titles to mostly do away with comedy to pursue a more serious storyline in a hard fantasy setting.

These kits just contain a few items, usually either build and buy mode or CAS, although some contain a mix of both. We’re here to rank the top ten Sims 4 kits, so you know which ones to add to your game, and which to pass over.

This is the final piece of content before the Atlantis update next week, and the new content drop is slightly small. However, there are eight new species added to the Bestiary, and they're tied with the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest.


How to start the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest in Fisch


This weekend's actions take place at the newly launched Grand Reef Island in Fisch. Once you reach the island, you'll notice areas where a storm is taking place (marked by the whirlpools). You'll find a Pirate Ship parked close to these whirlpools. Jump on the ship and you'll meet Captain Neptune on it.


Once you talk with him, you'll receive the only task of this mini-quest.




How to complete the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest in Fisch


Once you've begun the quest, you'll have to complete the Atlantean Storm Bestiary. This Bestiary includes eight permanent fishes of varying rarities. To catch them, you'll have to fish in the regions where the whirlpools are situated. Make sure to check out this guide, which details all eight species that you'll need to find.


Do note that the fish spawn at all times, but you'll have to alter your setup based on which species you want to find. Once you complete the Bestiary, head back to the Pirate Ship. Talk to Captain Neptune and inform him that you have completed the Bestiary.


You'll get x4 Hangman's Hook, x5 Kraken Tentacle, and a Drifter's Tale Bobber by completing the quest. It's a neat set of rewards ahead of the Atlantis update scheduled for next week.

Many of these re-imaginings are solid, and even the worst ones are fun to watch with friends. However, some of the best video game adaptations I’ve seen and read have been comic books and graphic novels.


I've loved comics and video games since I was too short to reach the top shelves at most comic and game stores. Since then, I’ve read dozens of comics based on video games. A few struck out hard, but others are fantastic companions to their source material, perfectly re-creating the feel of the games they're from and building on their lore in fun ways.

Whether it's the subtle satisfaction of seeing a wrongdoer get their due or the dramatic payoff of a well-executed scheme, there's something inherently compelling about a story driven by vengeance. As such, it's not surprising that various media — including manhwa — use revenge as a central theme in their narrative.


But just like in other tropes, revenge alone cannot make a series compelling. It must have a cast of good characters, an interesting storyline, and good pacing. Of course, good art and some sense of humor won't hurt, too. These 10 manhwa deliver exactly these.

How to get Amethyst Components in the Arknights: EndField beta


Amethyst Components are essential for crafting gear in Arknights: Endfield. Without them, your characters will be left defenseless and unprepared for battle. Despite having access to Amethyst Crystals fairly early on, you'll probably notice no obvious method of crafting Amethyst Components specifically, even using a Refiner or Scrapper. After all, refining Amethyst creates Amethyst Fiber, while shredding it creates Amethyst Powder; neither is what you need.

Best Amulet Notables in Path of Exile 2


The most effective Amulet Anointments are those that provide substantial benefits to your build without requiring you to path over to the Notable in the passive tree. After all, if the Notable is already close to your current investments, anointing it on an amulet becomes unnecessary. With the wide variety of viable builds in Path of Exile 2, there are several Anointments worth considering. Here are some of the most potent ones to prioritize.

All eight species can spawn at any time of the day, but the chances for the Maelstorm Shark and Void Angler is pretty low. 


Where to catch the Atlantean Storm Bestiary fish in Fisch


To get the Atlantean Storm Bestiary species, you'll have to head to the Grand Reef. You'll have to reach the island, where you'll find whirlpools spawning all around the region. Once you find the storm, take your boat, and start fishing in the region. 


This is likely going to be the final piece of content before the Atlantis core update is released. It's almost a month since we received the Northern Expedition, and plenty of major additions are expected next week. In the meantime, make sure to complete the bestiary and the new pirate quest, which allows you to win cool rewards.

Rowling somehow managed to carve a world that resonated with an entire generation and continues to pull them back in time and again years later. 


I’m not ashamed to admit that I love the world of Harry Potter. I was pulled in with the first book at the age of seven, and despite a now much deeper understanding of where Rowling may have gotten her ideas from, the Wizarding World has always had its hooks in me to some degree. As I grew up, I found myself yearning for a more realistic ending, where perhaps everything didn’t get tied up in a neat bow with the name “Weasley” on the gift tag. 


That’s where fan fiction comes in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Secret Banana Fish has been on the lips of every Fisch player ever since its appearance was made viral on social media, and many have tried to figure out how to catch it inside the game.


The name of the fish started doing the rounds after an image and video were shown by Kazer, who's pretty well known in the Fisch community. Interestingly, you can't officially catch this fish if you believe the developers. Yet, there's a backdoor approach you can take to catch this peculiar species.


How to catch Secret Banana Fish in Fisch


The Banana Fish is elusive for a reason, as it's a Developer/Admin fish. In simpler terms, it's not a part of the official Bestiary associated with any region, and cannot be caught by normal players. It can only be caught either by admins or by content creators who are directly partnered for producing Fisch-related content.


Interestingly, there was even a wiki page stating the steps to take if you wanted to catch this fish. Since then, the page has been taken down, but there might be plans for the Banana Fish to be added to the Fisch Bestiary in the future. If you're unwilling to wait, here's all the information you need to know.



Name: Banana


Rarity: Secret


Location: Ancient Isle


Weather: Rain


Versions: 2 (Shiny and Standard)


Season: Summer


Time: None


Preferred Bait: None





It remains to be seen if the developers will add the Banana Fish to the official Bestiary. For a long time, the Travis Scott Secret Fish wasn't available in the full game, but it was later added for the public. Once added, we will add more information to this piece regarding how you can add it to your Bestiary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dimensional Finger is one of the several items available inside Jujutsu Infinite, but the game doesn't make it clear how you can obtain it.


There are certain items you can also craft from the Crafting Station, and this also includes a few Special Grade drops. However, the Dimensional Finger item can't be crafted with the help of any other resource. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this specific item in the first place and what's its best use-case scenario in Jujutsu Infinite.


How to obtain Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite


To get Dimensional Finger, you'll have to clear the main storyline. You'll come across different NPCs who are directly linked with the main set of quests. Interacting with them allows you to start and complete different quests and unlock a variety of rewards.


Your first opportunity to obtain Dimension Finger can be found in Shijo Town's Level 30 quests, where you'll need to defeat the Rogue Sorcerer. Once you defeat the Sorcerer, you'll be able to get a Dimensional Finger.




How to use Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite


The Dimensional Finger is required to travel across different portals. These portals are found in the villages, and you'll need the item in discussion to shift through them. Once you enter the rifts, you'll find different Cursed Spirits and other types of enemies. Once you take them down, you'll get a lot of credits and XP.


Additionally, taking down these enemies also helps you to get more valuable rewards like Cursed Tools and Special Grade items. Of course, the rewards won't be the same in every run, but entering and clearing these portals is pretty rewarding in general. Whenever you have a Dimensional Finger and come across a portal, make sure to enter and clear out the enemies.

Once it does, the Switch 2 is going to, directly or indirectly, compete with the Steam Deck. After all, there are certain similarities between the two, which could force a lot of us to make an important decision.


Yet, I strongly believe that the comparison isn't going to be a straight-faced battle at all, and let's take a look at what will be a potentially better deal in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Nintendo being in the limelight again because of their long-awaited announcement of the Switch 2’s announcement, does that mean Marvel Rivals is coming to Nintendo’s hybrid consoles?


Is Marvel Rivals on Switch?


As of now, Marvel Rivals is not on the Nintendo Switch. This is most likely due to the hardware’s very outdated specs. Since the game isn’t even on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles, it would only make sense. 


These three consoles are on the verge of finally being sunsetted as there’s less support for this generation in terms of new games. Besides, performance issues will be a huge problem if this game were ported to last-gen consoles.


Is Marvel Rivals coming to the Switch?


It’s highly unlikely that this game will be coming to the Switch. As it stands right now, nothing major is really releasing for Nintendo’s hybrid console other than some remasters, ports, and collections.

Is Marvel Rivals coming to Switch 2?


With the Switch 2 coming later in 2025, we do not fully know if Marvel Rivals will be released on that platform. 


We do not even know the fully confirmed specs of the console yet, so it’ll be hard to determine if that will be a possibility or not. 


Rumors and leaks suggest that it’ll have capabilities between a PS4 and PS4 Pro, which is a big upgrade for Nintendo. However, the specs still do not compare to those of a base PS5 or an Xbox Series console. 


Since players, namely on the PC side, have dealt with and are still now dealing with the 99% error, shader errors, and other miscellaneous problems, that won’t be all too well for players on inferior hardware.


Whether or not Marvel Rivals will be coming to the Switch 2 (at the most), we’ll be sure to let you know any further updates on the matter.

Kurtis Trent is one of the most baffling characters in gaming history. Not only was he an unnecessary addition as a counterpart to Lara, but he doesn't even feel like a complete character — story- or gameplay-wise. 


Kurtis' biggest selling point was that he could control a disk with telekinetic powers, but that didn't end up in the final game. With the remaster, players will finally be able to use his Chirugai disc, cast an energy shield upon Kurtis, and even have a bunch of l…]]></summary>

Here's how to find the Amethyst so that you can help villagers like Ursula and Nala with their friendship quests. 


Amethyst Disney Dreamlight Valley locations


Amethyst in Disney Dreamlight Valley can be spotted in two different locations within the original valley:



Frosted Heights


Forgotten Lands



Screenshot by Destructoid


Thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC to get this material. Head over to the Frosted Heights or Forgotten Lands and use your pickaxe to strike the rocks in the area. Also, take a buddy with you with the mining proficiency to gain bonus rewards from striking each rock. You'll also get that friendship level up. 


How to Make a Purple Wrought Iron Streetlamp


Once you've gathered Amethyst, you can create a Purple Wrought Iron Streetlamp. To make that, you'll need the following:



Two Glass


Five Iron Ingots


One Amethyst



You can create Iron Ingots at the crafting table by mixing Iron Ore and Coal Ore. You'll get those materials from mining rocks (and the number of resources grows when hanging out with a friend who has the mining specialty). Glass can be formed by crafting Sand and Coal Ore. Dig at the sand of Dazzle Beach with your shovel to get the resource.


If you don't want to make a Purple Wrought Iron Streetlamp, you can also sell Amethyst for 500 Star Coins at any of Goofy's stalls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2024, legal action taken by Spain's top-tier football league led to telecoms giant Telefonica disclosing the identities of alleged pirates among its own subscribers. Telefonica's cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn't expected at all.

You probably already know this, but the Nintendo Switch 2 was officially unveiled to the world yesterday. And you've also likely noticed that we haven't stopped thinking about it since.
The brief trailer — coming in at two minutes and twenty-one seconds — seemingly hinted at a few features while not giving away too much. We got a look at the new design, the bigger size, and what seems to be mouse functionality on the Joy-Con. But we think there's a bit more hiding in plain sight. So, the lovely Alex and Felix on our YouTube channel have jumped head-first into the trailer and pulled out the juiciest details that might be a bit less obvious.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

Yes, the game we're currently referring to as Mario Kart 9 is still somewhat shrouded in mystery, but the short tease revealed a number of tantalising hints as to what we might expect from the upcoming Switch 2 title.

Famitsu has posted the latest boxed sales charts for Japan, and this time, Freedom Wars Remastered makes its debut on the Switch and the PS5. Rather predictably, the Switch version sold more copies at 8,277 (4,829 on the PS5) but couldn't quite manage to climb the ranks and claim the top prize.
It's the only blip in what is otherwise a pretty familiar sight by now, with Super Mario Party Jamboree once again topping the charts, followed not-so-closely by Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Overall, sales figures have dropped significantly from the rush over the Christmas and New Year period, but this is to be expected.

It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

And so it begins. Nintendo has pulled back the curtain on its next generation of hardware to reveal... exactly the thing everyone expected.
Officially revealed earlier today following months — no, years — of rumours, speculation, and leaks, the Nintendo Switch 2 is, on the face of it, what most people wanted. It's the same basic concept, just a bit bigger, with more power and some improvements, plus hints at a couple of gimmicks not explicitly detailed in the trailer. We also glimpsed a few seconds of a new Mario Kart.

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

Footage from the game was pretty scarce, to say the least, but we've still noticed a few things that might be notable as we look forward to its upcoming launch – whenever that may be!

My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

An official statement published this week reveals that between 2021 and November 2024, a total of 3,682 pirate sites were blocked to prevent exploitation of local content. Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

But hey, at least I'll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In its annual report published last week, the U.S. Government listed MagisTV as one of the most notorious piracy services. The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often get sent so many games from publishers and developers that we simply don't have the time or capacity to play. But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.
Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins. Finally, a game brave enough to ask: "what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?".
It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy mid-January all! The year is picking up pace in terms of new PC game releases, and the symptoms of the Maw's hunger are everywhere. For example, my fridge has started bleeding an iridescent fluid. Peering into the oily green depths, I see a much older, cyborg version of myself dressed in spiked leather against a background of burning oceans. The other Edwin mouths and gesticulates urgently, but I have no time for his dire warnings of global calamity. There are new entertainment products to discuss! Here's what's coming down the pipe this week.

Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues the misadventures of Henry of Skalitz, 15th century Bohemian blacksmith's son and chivalric Laddy Lad, who is questing to reclaim his murdered father's sword from some absolute shit of a noble. The prologue starts you off as the handsomely equipped and fully levelled-up bodyguard of Sir Hans Capon - an exasperating gadabout and your bosom chum from the 2018 game. You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Factions. Here are the factions: the aggressive conquest Klingon guys. The evil insectoid hive mind who build stuff and/or have loads of cheap soldiers. The researchers who are probably robots and you usually pick because they can be competitive at anything. The diplomacy/espionage ones (humans, or The Greys).
You know what I'm talking about. You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we've had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years. It's been a while though since I read through every word of every faction's description and wanted to play all of them. Zephon captured my interest immediately.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

This follows last year's Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

According to site's Indian operators, it is not possible to comply with High Court orders because a major DoodStream investor comes from Russia.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who believes in the ideal of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group.

Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t want to talk to a game. I assume I’m not alone in this, because the tech’s been around for donkey’s and barely anyone tries to use it. Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Yet as the highly-publicized blunders of 2024 showed, getting blocking wrong benefits nobody. To that background, a blocking specialist at anti-piracy company Friend MTS is encouraging restraint.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as "SNES-style". This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

The events will include a player who will beat a set of Elden Ring boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of Crazy Taxi with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in Fallout: New Vegas within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? "Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I'm interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
