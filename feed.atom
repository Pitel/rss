All Tactical Hologram Bosses Ranked in Wuthering Waves


Right before I jump into the ranking process, understand that the difficulty of boss encounters in Wuthering Waves depends on several factors, with one of the largest being personal skill. As such, this ranking is based entirely on my own skill level, which may be lesser or greater than yours. For a little context, I am currently on Difficulty 6 on every one of the Tactical Hologram bosses so far, so the rankings will be based on Level 5. I believe this still pretty much paints the same picture, however. Disclaimer over. The…]]></summary>

However, XDefiant developer ACHES pointed out the Vector as his favorite and provided a set of attachments that will help you elevate your game to another level. 


During XDefiant's three-year development period, few people have had more time playing the free-to-play title than ACHES, who joined Ubisoft as a game developer to help finish the project. The former Call of Duty world champion is no stranger to dominating FPS titles, and he has an inside scoop on which weapons perform best. Consensus highlights the MP7 as the best SMG in XDefiant, but statistics tell a different story.

In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Headland said that The Acoylte will introduce Star Wars fans to a new variety of lightsaber that has allegedly never appeared in any other form of Star Wars media. For those who might not know, The Acoylte is set during the waning days of the High Republic, around fifty to one hundred years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumors alleged that XDefiant movement mechanics could be hindered in Season 1, but Ubisoft's Mark Rubin quickly stepped in and put those claims to bed. 


Landon Apollo claimed that mid-air directional movement and strafing would be removed from XDefiant Season 1, along with a nerf to bunny hopping. Rubin responded, "I'm pretty sure that's not true. And I know a guy on the inside." 




That isn't to say there won't aren't any movement changes coming down the pipeline. XDefiant developer ACHES confirmed that the team intends to punish players for repeated jumps and crouches by adding aiming sway. Ubisoft doesn't want to restrict players from using any of the free-to-play shooters' mechanics, but ACHES argued that there is a sweet spot between intended use and spam. As for when this update will go live, On May 25, the XDefiant developer reassured fans that the update would be added in soon. 


If players had a chance to play the XDefiant close beta in 2023, they would have had an opportunity to see the aim sway penalty in action. If a player jumped consecutively too many times in a row, their weapon would shake back and forth, making it hard to quickly line up a shot on an enemy. So even though there won't be any substantial movement changes coming, players will have to readjust their plans once this patch goes out. Currently, most players like to use their momentum from a slide into a jump to catch an enemy off guard. Once jumping gets nerfed, players will have to be more cautious about the movement feature and pick their spots with more intent. 


Movement speed is always a contentious topic in FPS titles, and there will inevitably be a frustrated segment of the player base, regardless of how much of a difference this impending change makes. But if you are sick of getting killed by enemies jumping around you, there is at least a little bit of relief coming, even if it isn't wide-sweeping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a preview of the newest character coming to Genshin Impact: Emilie, a perfumist from Fontaine. Here’s everything we know about Emilie so far, from her element to her backstory.


Emilie’s element and details


Emilie is a Dendro character from Fontaine. Her Vision shape tells us that she has a Pneuma alignment. We can’t see her weapon or rarity from her character art, so we’ll have to wait for her kit details before we find out.


Emilie’s Constellation is called Pomum de Ambra, which is Latin for “apple of amber.” This is another name for pomanders – accessories used during the Middle Ages and Renaissance for carrying perfumes.


As a perfumist, Emilie creates a dazzling variety of perfumes for Fontanians to wear. According to Neuvillette, these scents aren’t purely for aesthetics. Some of them have aroma-therapeutic properties and can help regulate mood.


Oddly enough, Emilie’s drip marketing preview also includes mention of a “forensic cleaner.” It’s unclear if Emilie is actually a forensic cleaner as well as a perfumist. It may simply be a reference to how Emilie helps eradicate bad smells by covering them up with pleasant ones.


While we haven’t met Emilie before in Genshin Impact, she’s been mentioned in the past. Lyney, Lynette, and Wriothesley have voice lines about Emilie, and Chevreuse has mentioned being friends with Emilie during previous in-game events.

When is Emilie coming to Genshin Impact?


Given the timing of her announcement, we can expect Emilie to make her debut during Genshin Impact Version 4.8. If Genshin’s current update schedule holds, Version 4.8 should drop on July 17, with more character information being revealed in the weeks leading up to that date.


While we patiently wait for Emilie, Version 4.7 has plenty of new characters and events to keep us occupied, including a brand new game mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortuna is one of the free-roam NPC hubs in Warframe where you are introduced to the Solaris United, Vox Solaris, and Ventkids Syndicates. It’s also where you will have access to the huge Orb Vallis open world. 


Bosses, bounties, races, and so many other explorable areas of this map are yet to be encountered. But in this case, if you are trying to get there, here’s how.


Where is Fortuna in Warframe?


Fortuna is located on the planet Venus. You’ll first have to progress through the planet going south until you get to the Venus Junction. 


To access the Venus Junction, you must do the following:



Complete the Vor’s Prize quest


Complete Saya’s Vigil


Use the Fusion system to rank up any mod

Do this by using the Endo collected into your mission. Go to your mod console across from the foundry and select any mod. Select Fusion and start upgrading.

Once these conditions have been met, defeat the Volt Specter who awaits you in a battle. Upon defeating him, you will now be able to access Venus.


Just complete the E. Gate and Unda missions to get to Fortuna. Upon unlocking the node, you can access the hub with most of the NPCs available to talk to. As you progress more into the quest line, increase your standing with the people there, and unlock the tougher content, everything will eventually become available.


If you are still early on into your questing and progressing through the Star Chart in Warframe, you may not be able to beat the higher bounty levels as they are multi-staged and present you with harder enemies. In that case, you can revisit this area once you have a build that can help out.

While some can be easy to find, others prove more difficult due to their rarity. So, to help you with your search, here's how to get and use the Group Abomination Tacet Core in Wuthering Waves.


Where to find Group Abomination Tacet Cores in Wuthering Waves


Group Abomination Tacet Cores can be found in the Mech Abomination domain in the Whining Aic's Mire. Look to the southeast side of the map within the Court of Savantae Ruins to spot it.

It's a neat premise for a bullet hell/metroidvania hybrid inspired by the top-down Legend of Zelda titles, and the game lives up to it.

Alhaitham’s best Quicken teams


As an on-field DPS, Alhaitham will rely on triggering Spread as many times as possible to deal the most damage. This means pairing him with off-field Electro teammates to trigger Quicken, which allows Alhaitham to trigger Spread. Fischl, Beidou, and Yae Miko are good offensive picks, while Kuki Shinobu makes for a good healer. Pick one or two Electro teammates to complement Alhaitham.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the trickier dailies to get in Warframe is to suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam melee attack. Since it’s not as easy as getting a collateral kill with something like an ability or AoE weapon, what’s the trick? We can help you get this below.


How to easily suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam attack in Warframe


You can do this challenge with most melee weapons in the game, but some make it easier than others. Typically, heavy weapons like hammers and heavy blades have larger heavy slam attack radiuses. 


You’ll also want to play missions that have high enemy density so there’s a higher likelihood of getting this challenge done easily. Here’s a list of missions with high enemy density:



Lua - Tycho


Lua - Yuvarium


Lua - Circulus 


Uranus - Ophelia


Sedna - Adaro


Deimos - Terrorem


Deimos - Persto


Deimos - Testudo



To make things even easier, you want to use frame abilities that can group enemies together. Using frames like Khora, Mag, Nidus, or Vauban can make this challenge trivial. 


If you do not have access to these frames, there are a lot of melee weapons with exceptional slam radiuses.

Best melee weapons to suspend 5 enemies with a heavy slam attack


These are the best melee weapons to use to suspend five enemies with a heavy slam attack. They have the largest slam radius and can pair very well with grouping abilities.



Arca Titron


Kuva Shildeg


Magistar


Fragor


Sibear


Ekhein


Fragor Prime


Heliocor


Synoid Heliocor


Jat Kittag


Volnus


Wolf Sledge


Sancti Magistar


Masseter


Masseter Prime


Volnus Prime



Out of all of these weapons, the Volnus Prime has the largest heavy slam radius, making it the best of the bunch. The others will do just as fine, even those that aren’t on the list.

Currently, no "Unwarranted Feather" items are available in Wuthering Waves.

One such nuance is Swap Cancelling, and it is a necessity if you want to face the hardest content Wuthering Waves has to offer.


How to use Swap Cancelling in Wuthering Waves


Swap Cancelling is the act of performing an attack with one character, then immediately swapping to another, mid-animation, so that the first character's attack still fully executes. This sequence can be performed on almost any attack in the game, though the best use of it is during ones with long animations. There are a few reasons with incredible benefits for performing successful swap cancels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been trying to log into Destiny 2, you've likely encountered a significant roadblock. This is due to a crucial server downtime, a necessary step to prepare for the highly anticipated release of The Final Shape. So, if you're eagerly awaiting to jump in, here's how long Destiny 2 will be down.


Destiny 2 server downtime for The Final Shape, explained


Based on the Destiny Server and Update Status page, Destiny 2 will be offline until June 4 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET. That means the server downtime will last around 24 hours, starting on June 3 at 9 a.m. PT.


Image via Bungie


During this time, Destiny 2 players won't be able to log in or participate in activities. An ongoing Destiny maintenance period will also last for a few more hours, ending around 12 p.m. PT on June 4. You'll still be able to play the game two hours prior, but you may encounter some sign-on issues until the maintenance has concluded. In this case, players may be placed in a queue while it is active.


Once Destiny 2's downtime is up, players can expect the launch of The Final Shape. The DLC drops at the same time and features a new campaign with an immeasurable number of unique challenges. Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it's best to prepare during the downtime, just so you're ready for launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who's played Warframe for a decent amount of time knows mods are the lifeblood of any gear piece . Weapons and frames can do okay on their own, but once you install the right mods and get them synergizing with each other, you can tear through even level 100-200 enemies with ease. 


One such mod can be slotted into any frame and provides great bonuses when dodging. Here's how to get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe


To get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe, you must first gain access to Arbitrations. This mode will unlock upon completing every node on the Star Chart, excluding the Jordas Golem and Mutalist Alad V Assassinate missions. Once done, the Arbitration node should appear on your Star Chart under the Operations window. When running these new missions, you want to look for Arbitration Shield Drones which, when killed, have a chance to drop Vitus Essence. You'll also be granted Vitus Essence when completing these missions.

Once you have at least 20 Vitus Essence, head to any Relay and into the Arbiters of Hexis room, noted by a symbol on your minimap with a sword overlaying a shield. Inside you'll find two NPCs, including one named Arbitration Honors. Speak with them, and you'll be able to purchase the Rolling Guard mod for 20 Vitus Essence. You can also purchase a handful of other mods and goodies, though you'll need more than 20 Vitus Essence naturally.


Is the Rolling Guard mod worth using?


At max rank, the Rolling Guard mod grants you invulnerability for three seconds and removes all Status Effects when dodging, with a seven-second cooldown. This makes it incredibly useful for tougher missions where Status Effects are spammed and is especially useful on Limbo. Provided you re-enter his rift after three seconds, you'll have continuous protection against Status Effects.

WayForward Technologies has worked on several well-known franchises over the years, including the likes of Contra, Silent Hill, The Mummy, Transformers, and even Aliens. Despite this, the reveal that the developer would collaborate with Atari on a brand new Yars entry came as a genuine shock to many, this writer included.
Not only is Yars' Revenge one of the most beloved Atari 2600 games of the early '80s, but the game, along with its sequels, is fundamentally an arcade shooter. So when WayForward introduced Yars Rising as a Metroidvania starring charismatic hacker Emi Kimura, you'd be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. How could such a drastic departure from the original possibly work? Would snippets of classic Yars gameplay sprinkled throughout the experience be enough to satisfy old-school fans?

Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

As part of the Season 4 update, Raven Software slightly adjusted Warzone's meta by buffing the FJX Horus, MCW, and AMR9. According to WZRanked all three weapons skyrocketed in popularity and are used in most Warzone matches. However, no weapon gets used more than the Kar98k, which leads the pack with a 20% pick rate. Season 4 brought back the beloved sniper rifle, and it dominates just as much as it did before, boasting a one-shot kill distance of 86 with the right set of attachments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its initial reveal three years ago, Metal Slug Tactics had been hit with some delays. Now it has its eyes on the prize, with publisher Dotemu and developer Leikir Studio announcing a fall 2024 release window. 


That release includes some additional platforms. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles are now in the mix along with the previously planned launch on Nintendo Switch and PC. The news served up the perfect opportunity to share a new trailer, which shows more of the lovingly crafted pixel art tactics and trademark Metal Slug shenanigans. 




If you're looking for a way to try this out ahead of fall, a limited-time demo is planned for Steam Next Fest from June 10 through 17. 


Metal Slug Tactics has looked promising ever since it was first announced. The charm of SNK's long-running-and-gunning series appears to be wholly intact and transplanted in an oddly fitting new genre. Tactics promises a mix of strategy gameplay with some rogue-lite progression elements, but the maps themselves are all hand-crafted. There are 110 maps in all and 20 mission types throughout the course of the campaign. 


Between all that and the numerous loadout possibilities, Metal Slug Tactics sounds like a kitchen sink attempt at taking the series into tactical territories. Throw in a soundtrack from Tee Lopes (Sonic Mania, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Streets of Rage 4) and you've got me ready to head out onto the battlefield right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trishiraite is a rare local specialty found in the northernmost deserts of Sumeru. Whether you’re farming for Sethos or just expanding your gem collection, here are all Trishiraite locations in Genshin Impact.


Trishiraite locations and farming route


Trishiraite is exclusively found in the northernmost regions of the Sumeru desert, namely Gavireh Lajavard and Realm of Farakhkert. Look for clusters of red crystals growing out of the ground. If you have Tighnari in your party, he will highlight their locations on your minimap. Be sure to bring Zhongli or a Claymore user, too, since you’ll need to break the crystals with blunt attacks in order to gather them.


Below is a map of all 57 Trishiraite locations in Genshin Impact, with paths drawn to indicate a farming route on the interactive map. These farming routes sometimes go underground. If you find yourself missing a teleporter or unable to access an area, progress the Khvarena of Good and Evil regional World Quest.

Where to buy Trishiraite


There are currently no NPCs who sell Trishiraite. The only Trishiraite available to collect are the 57 nodes in the open world.


How to use Trishiraite


Trishiraite is a Sumeru local specialty, and therefore used to Ascend some Sumeru characters. As of Version 4.7, only Sethos uses Trishiraite as his Ascension material.


Each character uses 168 Trishiraite to reach max Ascension. Local specialties respawn 48 hours after collecting them, and there are only 57 Trishiraite locations in Genshin Impact, meaning you will have to complete the farming route three times in order to fully Ascend one character.

Well this is a welcome surprise! Publisher Dotemu and developer Leikir Studio have today announced that the much anticipated Metal Slug Tactics will be blasting its way onto Switch this Fall (or Autumn, if you'd like).
This one was actually revealed at E3 back in 2021 and was subsequently hit with delays before going silent in recent months. But hey, now we have a release window and a new trailer to go alongside it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation's online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn't happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, "Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits." The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why," Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. "I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping." 
Here's a clip of it, too: 
😭 pic.twitter.com/CPoIy0zrOh
June 3, 2024
Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the "but you guys can keep hoping" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series' future with Final Fantasy, and more. 
Do you think we'll hear about Kingdom Hearts IV this upcoming weekend? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

Those expecting more news of Kingdom Hearts IV at this year's Summer Game Fest might want to temper their expectations as a recent message from Mr. SGF himself, Geoff Keighley, suggests that Sora's next adventure won't be making an appearance in the showcase (thanks, Push Square).
The message comes from Keighley's latest Q&A Twitch stream where the show's organiser and host ran through what to expect from this year's event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations. I've played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you'll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

Abubakar Salim, founder of Surgent Studios and director of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has taken to social media to address the "constant targeted harassment" levelled at him and his team since the game's launch on 23rd April 2024.
In a video posted to Twitter clocking in at just under five and a half minutes, he states that the constant criticism from people who "see diversity as a threat" has now "reached this fever pitch." He goes on to promote the inclusion of diverse stories and characters in games, stating, "If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that that game is still for you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The "shells" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

Tentokrát se strahováci podívají na zoubek velmi slibně vypadajícímu open-source EDM projektu - ne, nejde o taneční hudbu, ale o elektroobrábění. Ukáží taky, jak vypadá starší cykloradar zevnitř nebo jak se testuje odolnost iPhonů.

Když už se mluví o hardwaru, je tu nová soutěž od Hackaday, ve které jde o nápady, které se vejdou do velikosti klasické vizitky. Ukáží i pár levných blbinek z Číny včetně bezdrátové tiskárny nebo antén pro blízké pole.

Ze softwarových témat stojí za zmínku nová ROM pro československý počítač Ondra nebo jak aktuálně probíhá hackování nedávno vydaného multitasking MS-DOSu.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 4. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

There I'm in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. It's those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka "Swery65" Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.

No, you can't go back and read it again to get younger. Time marches on, so thank you for spending your precious seconds on this silly intro. We'll get to the point.
'Retro games' — how do you classify them? Do you count years, generations, or is there some other personal metric you use to delineate between what's 'old' in the realm of video games? Do you need to be able to count the pixels with the naked eye?

Overmorrow, the debut release from solo developer PixelManta, manages to be philosophically interesting, is evocatively written, visually distinct, and lovingly crafted.

Tomba! Special Edition is an enhanced rerelease created for modern consoles using the Carbon engine. Plus, original creator Tokuro Fujiwara has been working with LRG to bring the classic back to life. It's not just a straight remaster, either — Special Edition adds new features to the 1997 classic to help introduce the game to a whole new audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Collaboration contents from outside Capcom will not be carried over".
The Nintendo 3DS had plenty of incredible exclusives and in its heyday, a lot of those were in the Monster Hunter series. One gem that truly stands out from its no-glasses-3D siblings is Monster Hunter Stories. Developed as a collaboration between Capcom and Marvelous, this turn-based RPG was quite a massive departure in comparison to anything that's come before and is highly regarded by those that did play it. However, Stories was overlooked by many at the time as it was dealt the unfortunate hand of launching six months after the console that would replace the 2DS and 3DS, the Nintendo Switch.
Flash forward to the year 2024, and not only has a Switch sequel to Stories released, but that first game that fans loved so much is finally making its way to Switch, too. We had the chance to send off a few questions to the Monster Hunter Stories team at Capcom and the game's producer, Yoshihiro Akira, was kind enough to give us his insight on the game's co-development with Marvelous, 3DS-exclusive features, and what it's like bringing this game to a new audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The studio states its new title is "very early in development" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about!

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

I've tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it's an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I've ever played.

Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man's Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, "As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This piece is being written on a train as I trundle towards our very first staff meeting with Rock Paper Shotgun's new overlords. The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I'm changing trains...

Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn't found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

        <updated>2024-05-30T23:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is "styling," which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the "save the world" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.
The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan." 
"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage." 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting.

The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while "tentpole" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: "You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way."
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-30T22:03:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we're inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game's release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant's leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.]]></summary>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot' Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…]]></summary>

This comes from one of PlayStation's dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…]]></summary>

I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-5-generation-is-already-sonys-most-profitable-yet"/>
        <updated>2024-05-30T13:42:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game & Network Services Segment" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.


This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.]]></summary>

I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.

To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

        <updated>2024-05-29T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.]]></summary>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, "The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games' versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery "video game", which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game's crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen.

Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

On Instagram, my ads feel uncannily targeted to me, and on X (formerly Twitter), I see a new batch of posters for Amazon’s upcoming Fallout streaming series called out for using A.I. N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sheer number and scale of video games released nowadays means that the infamous Steam backlog is better-fed than ever, gorging on half-played hundred-hour RPGs, never-touched indies amassed during summer sales and “I’ll get to it one day” PC pipe dreams. If you were hoping to task your descendants with continuing your quest to get all 1,700-plus achievements in Tales of Maj'Eyal or maintain your ranked leaderboard position in Dota 2, bad news: it turns out that you can’t pass on your Steam library after you die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final character of Street Fighter 6's Year 1 DLC plans, Akuma, finally hit the game earlier this week. I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

He shared the recipe for a Cuban dish – the Arroz con Pollo – in an in-game radio station in Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and it’s one that he describes as “very controversial.” The trick, according to Douglas, a senior writer at Night School Studio, is to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the dish instead of bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks.
“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way. I’m genuinely afraid of telling her this.”

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse.

Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada's Federal Court.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for some time that Fallout was coming to Fortnite, we just weren't entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season's wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There's a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit's The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle's Sunshine and Duncan Jones's Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

The primary aim is to shut down pirate sites but if that proves elusive, depriving sites of advertising revenue by placing them on a blacklist is seen as the next best thing. The Infringing Website List (IWL) isn't made public but since there was no celebration of its recent 10-year anniversary, here's what the decade-old list has been getting up to lately.

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.

Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name "Alice" you don't just say "oh hi" like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, "Alice". An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. "[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead," said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, "rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet."

From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You remember the ending of 2011's first-person bullethoser Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, right? Everyone does! A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter.
