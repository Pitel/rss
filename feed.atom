As we take a closer look at the report, which suggests that the personal details of millions could be at risk, the irony is unavoidable. Information on how to spot this scam is readily available, yet the scam itself relies on a steady stream of people eager to research on Z-Library, having done no research at all on the potential pitfalls.

While some players may have already braved the Raid and completed each of its five encounters, there's another layer of challenges lying in wait: the Raid Triumphs. Though some of these Triumphs are pretty cut and dry, some are more esoteric in the hints they provide. Players will likely want to complete as many Salvation's Edge Triumphs as possible, as most offer valuable rewards.


Every Raid in Destiny 2 has Triumphs associated with it, made up primarily of self-imposed challenges and restrictions. That said, it's often worth completing Raid Triumphs, as many reward gear like unique Exotic Sparr…]]></summary>

For your efforts, you'll nab a unique cosmetic for Bunny along with a Crystallization Catalyst. Here's how to complete it in record time.

1. The first record


Once you've unlocked Bunny, you'll receive a quest to speak with Alpha in Albion. He'll give Bunny a record, "Transcript of Operation Records - Restricted Zone: Level 1 Classification." To listen to the record, open your map and select the "Journal" tab. From there, select "Records" and "Descendant Records."

The main "sticking point," as the Guild notes in its statement, are A.I. protections. Negotiations for a new contract with a bargaining group that includes the aforementioned publishers, as well as other major ones like Take-Two, Insomniac, and WB Games, have had A.I. as a focal point. Video game voice actors and motion capture actors are seeking protections against the creeping influence of A.I. in games. As SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher puts it:

Developer Behaviour Interactive is iterating on 2v8 Mode in Dead by Daylight every time it puts it live for a limited-time event. At the time of writing, it feels a little rough around the edges, but the bones of how this mode should work are there. Killers have buffed powers, and Survivors have set classes so everyone is on a vaguely level playing field. But understanding how each Survivor class works is key if you're going to try to win a Trial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding the best bow build for your character in Elden Ring and even into the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC can be quite the task. How much do you want to dedicate your build to being a ranged attacker?


Do you want something to kill enemies with, or to get rid of those pesky ranged attackers that can ruin your progression? Here, we’ll go over a full-on bow build, some recommendations for things to equip, and more.


Best bow build for Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree


To start off, this build will simply utilize a bow from the list and talismans to amplify damage output. 


Best bows


The following is a list of the strongest bows in the game. In no particular order, you can’t go wrong with any of these: 



Full Moon Crossbow


Pulley Crossbow


Repeating Crossbow (DLC)


Black Bow


Albinauric Bow


Longbow


Pulley Bow


Lion Greatbow


Igon’s Greatbow (DLC)



We also included some crossbows here since they use similar materials to work. They function mostly the same but do require some setup, like manually reloading each shot.

Best Ashes of War for bows


The following is a list of Ashes of War that you can equip onto your ranged weapons that aren’t upgraded by Somber Smithing Stones:



Barrage


Rain of Arrows



There aren’t a lot here, but these are consistent with damage and pressure.


Best talismans for bows in Elden Ring 



Arrow’s Reach Talisman


Arrow’s Sting Talisman


Arrow’s Soaring Sting Talisman


Sharpshot Talisman



Having all four of these talismans will increase the effective range and overall damage to your bows. Just make sure you have an ample supply of arrows and bolts so you don’t run out at any point.


Also, if you’re going for a more hybrid approach where you want to incorporate melee into your build, consider Dexterity weapons as they tend to scale more with that stat as you upgrade them to +10 or +25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Dead by Daylight’s 1v4 asymmetrical gameplay is a little too intimate for your liking, there’s a 2v8 mode coming. For a while, anyway. It will be available from July 25th to August 8th. 


The Dead by Daylight 2v8 is not a permanent mode. Not right now, anyway. It’s time-limited.


This doesn’t mean that if you can’t play during the two weeks it’s available that you will never be able to experience it. There’s no confirmed date for when it will return, but the informative release about it uses the phrase “This first version of 2v8,” which suggests that this is the initial run of the mode and that it will return.

However, being a time-limited event, that doesn’t mean this it will return and just be a feature of Dead by Daylight. It might be that Behaviour Interactive will simply trot it out every so often to draw players in for a few weeks. It might gain a consistent schedule, but it hasn’t been announced. It might become something permanent, but that hasn’t been confirmed.


2v8 is looking to be an interesting shake-up. Rather than just throwing more survivors and more killers into the mix, things have been completely rebalanced to allow for this to work better with the additional players. "Please note that this is an iterative process, and we’ll be closely monitoring your feedback to ensure 2v8 continues to evolve in the right direction," Behaviour Interactive says.


Right now, we only know for sure that Dead by Daylight 2v8 is going to be available from July 25th to August 8th, 2024.

Removing one tank from both sides completely changed the dynamic of quickplay and competitive play, with overall mixed reception from the community. Nearly two years later, Blizzard has stepped forward to address this ongoing debate, and is apparently considering bringing back 6v6 teams for the first time.


A recent Director's Take from OW2 director Aaron Keller dove deep into this topic, discussing why Blizzard shifted from 6v6 to 5v5 and their thoughts on the original team sizes. According to the post, having two tanks, damage dealers, and supports apiece on a team tended to make the matches much slower, with damage characters feeling less impactful …]]></summary>

Nobody Wants to Die’s world terrifies me. Set only a few hundred years in the future, it paints a dystopian society where humanity has unlocked the secret to immortality, but instead of eternal bliss, it paved the way for the government to have full legal control of our bodies. The world is as fascinating as it is upsetting, and a high-profile murder becomes the catalyst for a gripping (though not always actively engaging) mystery within it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Souls-like looter-shooter Remnant 2 is celebrating its one-year anniversary since its release on July 25, 2023. Though developer Gunfire Games initially promised three DLCs within a year after release, it looks like we’ll be waiting a bit longer for the third DLC: The Dark Horizon. 


We can expect The Dark Horizon to release sometime in September 2024. Though initially promised by July of this year, Gunfire Games has delayed its release to “deliver [players] the best possible experience”.


In the meantime, there’s no word on the next Aberration Domination event – the only way to efficiently obtain rare Corrupted Shards in Remnant 2. The first two DLCs were preceded by an Aberration event in the weeks before their release. This means there will probably be another Aberration event sometime in August before The Dark Horizon launches. Or at least, I hope so. I’m missing a lot of Corrupted guns.


What we know about The Dark Horizon


The Dark Horizon is the third and final DLC for Remnant 2. Since the first and second DLCs were set in Losomn and Yaesha, The Dark Horizon will take place in N’Erud. The previous two DLCs included some new maps with unique aesthetic flair, so it will be exciting to see how Gunfire Games decides to spruce up the desolate landscapes of N’Erud. 


Image via Gunfire Games


Along with The Dark Horizon DLC, Remnant 2 will be adding a new game mode and progression system that will be free for all players. Included is a teaser screenshot that shows a third game mode slot next to Campaign mode and Adventure mode. There are no other details regarding these new features, so we’ll just have to wait until the next announcement to learn more.


Happy anniversary to all Remnant 2 players and the team at Gunfire Games! I’m looking forward to diving back into Remnant 2 again.

With it, we have a new Attraction system that ultimately determines a Sim's relationship. There's also a Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs feature that functions similarly to the likes/dislikes. In this guide, we'll explain the Sims 4 Lovestruck Attraction system in detail.


What is Attraction in Sims 4 Lovestruck?


Lovestruck's Attraction mechanic determines how two Sims interact with one another in a romantic scope. You can customize your character's Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs to decide what they are attracted to. It can be something as minor as a hair color preference or a particular personality trait.


If another Sim reflects these Turn-Ons (and vice versa), building your romantic relationship with them will be much ea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're short of fodder in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, the Desiree Scott FUTTIES SBC could be worth considering.


You can get a promo item for your squad for the cheapest possible prices when it comes to fodder. For most players, obtaining this card can be done for free using the cards they have in their squads. Let's take a look at how you can unlock this special item in Ultimate Team. 


EA FC 24 Desiree Scott FUTTIES SBC tasks


The solo task has certain conditions, and requires the use of at least one TOTS/TOTW card. 


Task 1 - Desiree Scott



Min. 1 Players from: Canada


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 83



It's best to use a TOTW item to complete this challenge. TOTS cards are better used in SBCs that have higher-overall requirements. You can always bank on the 83+ TOTW Player Pick SBC in case you're running short of Team of the Week cards. 


EA FC 24 Desiree Scott FUTTIES SBC solutions


The Desiree Scott FUTTIES SBC is one of the cheapest live-service content in recent times. With a price of about 45,000 coins, this is as cheap as it could get. The price drops further if you generate the TOTW item using a SBC. 


Task 1 - Desiree Scott



Melvine Malard 82


Jadon Sancho 82


Leah Galton 83


Alphonso Davies 82


Klara Buhl 83


Mathilde Bourdieu 83


Joao Palhinha 83


Sophie Schmidt 83


Gaetan Laborde 82


Jorginho 83


Any 84-rated TOTW card



You get a 95-rated CDM card that comes with four playstyle+. This is a beginner-friendly SBC meant for those who might have started playing during the FUTTIES season. However, it's a great way to get a high-rated fodder by recycling low-rated cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following an action-packed demo, a launch date has been locked in for Iron Meat. Heavily inspired by Contra with an extra helping of body horror, Retroware's run-and-gunner hits consoles and PC on September 26, 2024.


When Iron Meat touches down, it'll be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, itch.io, and Epic Games Store. There's also an exclusive limited edition on the way to PS5 and Switch from Strictly Limited. These will be the only physical versions released around the world.


You can see more of the pulsating, oozing 2D action in the release date trailer:




Strictly Limited is dubbing its physical release of Iron Meat a "Speed Run," as it will arrive day and date with the digital release. They promise "no pre-order or additional waiting time," with more details to come soon. 


I really enjoyed the couple of stages I got to play of Iron Meat. It sticks incredibly close to the template Konami's Contra series provided, but the action set pieces, enemies, and boss designs left me wanting to see what else it has in store. 


Also like Contra, Iron Meat lets two players get together for some classic couch co-op. There are 30 unlockable skins, as well, each with interchangeable parts. Now you won't have to run and gun through the whole thing looking like a dollar store Probotector. I may come for the gory side-scrolling action, but I'm willing to stay for a little Iron Meat fashion mix-and-matching.

It's been part of every new add-on since then, including the latest Lovestruck expansion. So, if you want some handy tools, here are all the Sims 4 Lovestruck cheats.


What cheats are available for Sims 4 Lovestruck?


First things first, Simmers must enable cheats by pressing ‘Ctrl + Shift + C’ on PC or all four shoulder buttons for consoles. Then, enter 'testing cheats on' for the activation. Once that's out the way, you can enter the following cheats in Sims 4 Lovestruck:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golden axiom.
Pow Pixel Games slices its way onto the indie game scene with Abathor, an arcade-style throwback to fantasy belt scrollers of the '80s and '90s. It’s a pleasingly old-fashioned hack-'n'-slash platformer that will conjure memories of childhood couch co-op.
Golden Axe is the obvious influence, despite the side-on perspective, but there are also shades of more recent pixelated homages. A heavy metal aesthetic recalls the dark fantasy of Slain and Blasphemous, though its tone is much lighter than those games. Character designs, power-ups, and enemies are ripped straight from genre media. Abathor wears these influences proudly. It isn’t trying to do anything different and it’s all the more entertaining for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman has never been a small franchise, but it’s never been bigger than it is now. The World of Assassination trilogy that started in 2016 propelled it into the stratosphere. Which is surprising, since the series seemed to be at its lowest a few years earlier with Hitman: Absolution in 2012. Now you can own that lowest point for $2 on Steam.


That might not be fair. It’s complicated. By all accounts, it isn’t a terrible game, but many would agree that it isn’t a good Hitman game. Conrad Zimmerman, writing here at Destructoid at the time, seemed to like it. However, most would say it’s a bastardization, eschewing some of the more open-ended gameplay for what feels both more linear and also, well, dumber. Less sophisticated, if you will, and have forgotten what Hitman: Codename 47 was like. It’s assumed that, in an effort to achieve gameplay that is more accessible, it watered the whole experience down.




And then there were the rocket nuns. An early trailer depicted sisters of the cloth clad in bondage gear blowing up Agent 47’s motel room with a rocket launcher. He’s upset, so he has a bombastic gunfight with the BDSM nuns. He probably should have just said the safe word. However, the whole trailer seems like a “failed stealth” moment since the Hitman games are often about avoiding gunfights. It was, fortunately, not entirely indicative of the game’s content at launch, but it was jarring.


On Steam, Hitman: Absolution commands a 92% “Very Positive” rating with users. Like I said, it’s not terrible. Just don’t play it directly after playing Hitman: World of Assassination or Hitman: Blood Money. Set your expectations in the right place, and you might not be disappointed.


You could do worse for $2. I do worse for $2 most days.

The post Hitman series’ least loved entry is $2 on Steam, if you dare appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta draw the line somewhere.
Despite some glaring hardware limitations with the Nintendo Switch, third-parties have done wonders in porting games to the humble hybrid platform over the years. So much so that "just port it to Switch" or "put it on Switch" have become go-to comments from many fans when it comes to new or upcoming titles.
There comes a point, however, when you just need to accept that some games just won't run on the system. Take Monster Hunter: World, for example. Launched in 2018, it was a game that simply stood head and shoulders above what the Switch is capable of, and so Capcom made the decision to limits its release to the PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 players will have a new weapon in defense, with the introduction of professional fouls. 


In simple terms, a professional foul refers to a cynical tackle, something done to stop an opposition attack. The tackle is done with the full knowledge that it will lead to a foul, and the tackler has a high chance of getting a card. You'll be able to do the same action in EA FC 25, but there will be some caveats. 


Can professional fouls get you sent off in EA FC 25?


Based on EA Sports' description, you'll run a high risk of being sent off if you make excess use of professional fouls. This type of foul will always result in a yellow card when you perform them initially. A second use of the professional tackle with the second defender (already on a yellow) could potentially see them bein…]]></summary>

How to earn a Double Elimination in Fortnite: Pirate Code Four guide


Getting a double elimination in Fortnite requires getting two kills within a few seconds of each other. Although the exact time between is unknown, you'll want to try to go for less than three seconds between your two eliminations, or else you'll risk not getting your double elimination.


One way to make this easier is to play Fortnite as a duo or squad. Typically, duos or squad members stick together, making grouping enemies and…]]></summary>

Amid all the initial confusion, however, we happened to miss another little nugget that might be of interest.
Nintendo has announced that the Famicom controllers for Switch, which were previously exclusive to Nintendo Switch Online members, are now available for general sale (thanks, Sora News). In other words, then, folks in Japan can purchase a set even if they're not a Switch Online member.

It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has suffered yet another delay. The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.
Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. 


The delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.]]></summary>

We are back with the latest look at the Japanese gaming charts thanks to Famitsu and, unusually, a new Nintendo release has not taken the top spot.
Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition winds up in third in its debut week, only shifting 27,391 copies. It's hardly the biggest number for a physical debut (particularly from Nintendo) and it wasn't nearly enough to topple the Japan-only Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25, which sold 166,947 copies on Switch and 49,210 on PS4.

For many, it marked the beginning of an exciting new chapter in gaming. Although fans (including us) have undoubtedly been speculating as to what Nintendo's next-generation hardware might be for quite some time now, hearing an official confirmation from the firm that, yes, it's real and it's on the way, gives our ongoing hypothesizing some degree of validity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal caretaking sim Zoochosis is about being an ordinary zookeeper working in an ordinary zoo. What's that? There are no ordinary zoos? My mistake. Let me start again. Animal caretaking horror game Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its announcement early this year. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.

LEGO has today revealed a Shadow the Hedgehog bust set, which is set to be released on 1st October 2024.
Retailing for £59.99 / $69.99, the 720-piece kit features Shadow's head mounted on a stand with an attachable nameplate. It all sounds rather sinister when we write it out. Fortunately, the set features "Easter eggs hidden in both the head and the sturdy stand", so that takes the edge off it, right?

That’s thanks to initial production units not being up to standards, an AMD executive admitted, and comes shortly after rivals Intel copped to a potentially chip-killing fault in their latest Core processors.

The man charged with sending threats to Nintendo, leading to the cancellation of Tokyo's Nintendo Live event earlier this year, has been sentenced to one year in prison following a court ruling (thanks, Splatoon Torikara & Nintendo Everything).
The 27-year-old individual admitted to his crimes last month, blaming his increased frustration at losing Splatoon 3 matches. In the 39 threats submitted through Nintendo's official enquiry forms between 22nd April and 29th November 2023, the man threatened to "kill everyone involved" in the creation of the game and warned the company to "be careful about events that have spectators in attendance".

The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or The Tiger by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

The silent protagonist is a hotly debated topic among RPG enthusiasts. Usually acting as a stand-in for the player, this character is usually the lead, although they have no (or very little) dialogue, and can only interact with characters through basic dialogue options. And the creator of Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii, has weighed in on the difficulties of using silent protagonists in modern video games.
In a chat with the director of the Persona series Katsura Hashino published in Denfaminicogamer (and translated by Automaton Media), Horii admitted that "increasingly-realistic" graphics have made silent protagonists "increasingly difficult to depict".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re not far off from the August 9 premiere of Borderlands, and Lionsgate is giving the final hard sell for the upcoming adaptation in the form of a new trailer.
Like the first game, Borderlands centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora. They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its first trailer, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it. 


Borderlands is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).]]></summary>

The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. 
The announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. 
“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”
“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”
MultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.]]></summary>

BitSummit, held in Kyoto every sweltering hot summer, plays host to an incredible amount of indie developers from across the globe. As you might expect, it can be rather hard to stand out – so much so that it was even difficult for us to curate a list of impressive Switch games down to only 10 titles this year. However, Cassette Boy, with its muted Game Boy-like color palette, exuded so much retro charm that we couldn’t help but play it more than once, chatting with the sole developer Kiyoshi Honda whenever he had a moment to spare from the hordes lining up to play his game.

One of the coolest examples of the emergent gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the selection of outposts scattered throughout Hyrule, largely comprised of Bokoblins and other hapless beasts. Defeating them would unlock a nearby treasure chest, often containing a variety of goods including arrows, weapons, gemstones, or even rupees.
Not only are the chests useful for gaining new items, but they also look pretty cool; almost like a monster had once been turned to stone and subsequently manufactured into a treasure chest. Bizarre stuff. Anyway, it looks so awesome that someone's only gone and made a Switch cartridge case based on it. Check it out...

For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More tea, vicar?
Metroidvania fans seem to be living through a golden age. Hollow Knight and the Ori series, indie hits of the last decade, have established themselves as all-time classics, spurring on a horde of imitators, tributes, and new ideas. Even just 2024’s entries range from the imaginative, lo-fi hit Animal Well to the lavishly presented Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus may be yet another Metroidvania, but, remarkably, it’s yet another one worth your time.
The story opens with an atmospheric animated cutscene, in which a “Tentaihana” celestial blossom crashes down from the heavens into a lotus flower. This introduces Bo, a little fox-like creature draped in petals. Although the narrative doesn’t go very far, the tone of the world is developed effectively, with a cheery cast of characters ranging from a two-headed clairvoyant toucan to a fishcake–headed ramen chef. Dialogue never takes itself too seriously, whether it’s referencing classic memes, breaking the fourth wall, or going very tongue-in-cheek.

However, with today's news that such an art book is in the works, we have your first look at it, with its cover image below: 
Coming from Dark Horse Comics, a publication company responsible for all kinds of video game related books and comics, including a similar art book for 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, "The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard" will likely feature official game art, concept art, and more. That's just a guess for now, though – we'll have to wait to learn more. 
In the meantime, Dragon Age: The Veilguard graced the cover of our last Game Informer issue. You can check that out here, and in case you missed it, Game Informer has an entire hub full of exclusive details about the game from our visit to BioWare earlier this year.

Tiny Wonder Studio, the new development team behind the upcoming koROBO, has stressed that the project is very different from the Chibi-Robo series and that fans shouldn't go into it expecting a similar experience.
This comes via a new interview from our friends at VGC, during which co-directors Kenichi Nishi and Keita Eto (third co-director Hiroshi Moriyama wasn't present), alongside Hirofumi Taniguchi (music and VFX), all sat down to discuss the new game. When asked what prompted the team to create a spiritual successor to Chibi-Robo, Nishi shut down the comparison immediately.

The Casting of Frank Stone is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and we learned some exclusive details about the upcoming horror game during our trip to Behaviour Interactive’s studio in Montreal. Speaking to Supermassive creative director Steve Goss, he clued us in on the game’s most central and unique mechanic: the Super 8mm camera. 
Set within the Dead by Daylight universe, the game story unfolds in the summer of 1980 in the unassuming small town of Cedar Hills. It follows a group of teenagers who set out to film a horror movie at an abandoned …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-23T18:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.
Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. 


Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting "a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged."

The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since Diablo IV was added to the library in March.


This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new Game Pass price increases and subscription tier arriving in September, a move the FTC has taken issue with.

The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.


We traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be. The story also reveals some of the DBD-style mechanics remixing Supermassive’s traditional…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Against The Storms’ critters, Manor Lords’s perfect oxen, and now Cataclismo, Hooded Horse’s roster of strategy games share a common thread that many guard-the-village-em-ups can fatally overlook: they present a civilisation that’s worth protecting. Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore 'em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

That would be charming enough on its own, but your agricultural endeavours are set inside a Polly Pocket-style toy, with crops also able to be exchanged for furniture with which to decorate your diorama home. After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there's now a playable demo.

But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it's about Bellara Lutara, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out the game's expansive character creator, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.
Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a 20-minute gameplay trailer last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara.

Kunitsu-Gami is the kind of wonderful, left-field Capcom release we don’t see often these days. Bound to be a cult classic in the future, Path of the Goddess is original and does not lean on any of Capcom’s established properties. Instead, it relies on an admittedly difficult-to-explain but well-executed gameplay loop that I found hard to put down with an art style that is equally challenging to look away from.
Players take on the role of Soh, a masked swordsperson bound to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro as she slowly dances along the path …]]></summary>

The game is also getting a ranked mode.
Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. 


Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.
MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as The Joker, The Matrix's Agent Smith, and Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees.]]></summary>

The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.


SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.]]></summary>

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.

@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS
July 22, 2024
For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.
It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.
The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.
how do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. 
A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. 


Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.

Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

However, after studying political events in Bulgaria and the United States, it was possible to provide plausible information on potential contributing factors. Similar questions are now being asked about Fmovies. Did it die from a single blow or collapse under the cumulative effects of many?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest.

I did not know  how utterly burnt out I was on violence and misery until I held one of pet simulation Bobo Bay’s sentient blob critters in my arms and lavished snacks upon it. When I close my eyes, I can still hear Conscript’s shells falling in the distance. But here and now, there are only Bobos, the races they take part in, and the idyllic bay in which they reside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago, I remember having a chat with Brendy about FPS Metro Exodus’s choice to have characters frequently speak over each other in conversation. It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/18/forestrike-is-a-puzzle-like-kung-fu-game-by-the-makers-of-olija"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game's first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game. 
Unlike other Diablo classes, the Spiritborn is not based o…]]></summary>

And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh's skull-splitting horror game Slitterhead since I first heard the words "brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush". Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried visual novel games in the past, like A Space For The Unbound and Hatoful Boyfriend. And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

It’s an action RPG that made me pine for the outdoors and want to be whisked away from all my responsibilities and just exist for a bit. Each time I would finish playing I’d be thinking about my next getaway, and although dungeon delving wouldn’t be on my holiday itinerary Dungeons of Hinterberg is making me think twice.

Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
Fallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…]]></summary>

Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I increasingly judge Souls-adjacent games not by the height of their bosses or the depth of their dungeons, but the cleverness of their shortcuts, and Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn has my favourite shortcuts in an age. Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.

Unlike those saucy Haricots, however, I’ve always winced at how pricey the Xbox Wireless Controller is – except today, the last of Prime Day 2024, where UK-based Prime members can pick one up for a far more sensible £40.

NES games are difficult to revisit. They’re easy to find and play, but they are showing their age and have been for some time. To play the original Legend of Zelda, for example, rewards a difficult-to-control, often obtuse puzzle game whose importance to the industry is undeniable, but its contemporary fun factor is low. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition counters this with a strategy that WarioWare has been using to great effect since its inception: you only play classic Nintendo games for exactly as long as they’re fun – which in 2024 is anywhere from three secon…]]></summary>

Now you too can get one on the cheap, by way of a chunky Prime Day discount – and as if God himself was calling me a loser nerd, it’s the significantly brawnier RTX 4060 model to boot.

In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it's a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox 360 digital store shuts down later this month on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.
For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. 
Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:
Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.
Navigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.
Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds
Select the background art you want using the A button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. 
Tomb Raider Chapter
Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:
Finesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.
Hardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.
Specialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.


2v8 Mode
On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. 


Cross-Progression
Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. 
Today’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. 
Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.


We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. 
The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major Baldur's Gate 3 patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.

Here, though, you can nab the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Windforce OC edition at a 15% discount, bringing it down to a far more agreeable £238. Nice.

Here is when you can jump into each beta: 
Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers) - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT
Weekend 2: Open Beta (for everyone) - September 6 at 10 a.m. PT to September 9 at 10 a.m. PT
Both betas are multiplayer only and will feature several online modes, weapons, equipment, and perks for players to tinker with. 
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Set in 1991 during the Gulf War, the espionage-themed campaign centers on a mysterious organization's infiltration of the U.S. government.

Specifically, it’s the SanDisk Ultra, and not the diddly 64GB model in the picture above but the honking great 1.5TB version. It's dropped below the £100 / $100 mark for the first time and, while Amazon has the lowest overall prices, it’s on sale elsewhere, allowing you to dodge the usual Prime subscription requirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite ever mode of travel in games is flying, so I was already poised (in mid-air) to really enjoy swooping around the world of Flock. It's a gentle exploration game from the people who brought you Wimot's Warehouse and I Am Dead (including Pip Warr, RPS in peace) where you never touch the ground, instead gliding around the strange forests and rippling meadows atop a giant bird with a beautiful trailing tail. Big Journey vibes, but more whimsical and colourful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".

It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. 
With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. 
A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.]]></summary>

It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers.

It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Destiny 2 enjoyer-in-public Paul Tassi of Forbes wrote an article pointing out the similarities between The First Descendant’s in-game icons and those used by Bungie’s multiplayer looter shooter. Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they’re taking the concerns seriously, and will make adjustments so that the imagery "clearly reflects the unique identity" of their Warframe-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

Perhaps of greater significance is that the Driver series itself might not be dead, as a Ubisoft spokesperson said that they are "actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise".

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap."

Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game's developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details - or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than those of the many other developers who collect your personal information.

The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew attempts to highlight the best games of 2024 that have launched between January and July. This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it's more a conversation about this year's early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.
