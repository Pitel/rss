It's been another exciting week for Sonic the Hedgehog fans, with Sega not only releasing a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers at Gamescom's Opening Night Live but also confirming the title would be arriving on all platforms (including the Nintendo Switch) on 8th November.
With this anticipated "open-zone" entry getting closer by the day, it seems we've now got an idea of the file size for the Switch eShop version of the game. As shared by Nintendo Everything, Sonic Frontiers is currently listed on Nintendo's digital store as being 10.4GB in size. In contrast, Sonic Forces on Switch was 6.6GB, and Sonic Colors: Ultimate was just 6.8GB.

The Super Mario animated movie starring Chris Pratt as Mario was delayed earlier this year until April 2023. When it does eventually release, it seems there'll be some merchandise.
A new listing on Amazon (as spotted by @necrolipe) seemingly reveals Mattel is releasing a "Super Mario Bros. movie" UNO set. There are no images of this set, but it's expected to arrive at some point in March 2023.

Publisher Microids, perhaps best known for its love of classic gaming franchises and media IPs, has announced that it is launching its own music label, Microids Records. The new in-house venture will focus on releasing soundtracks from the French publisher's litany of PC and console games.
"Microids Records and the new Entertainment Division are testaments of Microids’ willingness to develop the company’s brands and contents wider than the video game medium," said Microids' VP of entertainment, Frédéric Claquin. "Being able to launch this label with two original scores signed by Inon Zur is a blessing and a true honour, especially as we celebrate the Syberia series' 20th anniversary."
As noted in the above statement, the first two releases from the label will be Inon Zur's dramatic scores to adventure titles Syberia 2 (2004) and Syberia 3 (2017). Going forward, fans can expect further releases from the new label, which has been formed as part of Microids' ongoing desire to increase its merchandising output beyond the realm of the physical video games themselves.
"This music label launch is a major milestone for Microids” adds company CEO Stéphane Longeard. "We have always had at heart to offer music scores enhancing the games we are creating and paying tribute to our great IPS, collaborating with renown artists like Inon Zur for instance. We are fully aware about the importance of a great musical atmosphere for players, and we cannot wait to share what will be released next under the Microids Records label!"
Microids' next release, Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia, will launch on October 13.

Tinykin isn't the Pikmin-inspired game I thought it would be, but that's okay. More than okay, actually. It's still a great 3D platformer with a slick sense of speed, an interesting world to explore, and yes, some nods to Nintendo's creature-chucking strategy series.
If you're someone who enjoys hunting down collectibles, it's a must-play. If you're more on the fence, and run the risk of feeling overwhelmed with too many trinkets to find, I can still recommend Tinykin. It's never unreasonable, and there's little if any downtime.
The indie game scene has been killing it with shorter yet still satisfying experiences, and this one's a fantastic distillation, albeit with a few elements I wish went further.

Something a little more low-key from the retro fun-fans over at Hamster this week, as the labyrinthine Arcade Archives has been bolstered with the arrival of Video System's hard-spikin' Super Volleyball on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1989, before receiving home ports on the Sega Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16, Super Volleyball is an incredibly typical take on the high-jumping beach sport. Two teams of four players battle it out on a very basic 2D plane, with each team representing one of eight global nations.
While Super Volleyball features neat animation and some neat picture-in-picture cutscenes, it has a generally clunky vibe and seems dated, even by 1989 standards. The same year would see other sports titles such as Midway's Arch Rivals, Technos' WWF Superstars, and Sega's Super Monaco GP. By comparison, Video System's release feels several years out of time and is admittedly a tough recommend in 2022.
You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Victory-Class Star Destroyer. Super Volleyball is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

With the imminent release of Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, we're getting ready to drown in another wave of excitement and nostalgia very soon.
With so many TMNT games having come to Nintendo consoles over the years, it's tough to know exactly where to begin, let alone which Ninja Turtle (or Hero Turtle in the UK) to choose once you do settle on a game. So, to help sort through them all, we asked you lovely Nintendo Life readers to rate the Turtles games you have played and help us rank every TMNT game on Nintendo systems — and the result is below.

The landscape of the Mario Kart series looks very different today than it did back in 1992 when Super Mario Kart was released for the Super NES. Of course, there is a clear improvement with respect to visuals and we now have new characters, karts, and courses dropping all the time thanks to the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass releases and Mario Kart Tour on mobile. Yes, there's now an official Mario Kart game on non-Nintendo hardware — what a world we live in! However, at its heart, Nintendo’s top racing franchise is today very much the same game that it was 30 years ago.
Across the titles in the Mario Kart series, each entry has had to work, naturally, within the technical boundaries of its respective console. As with any video game, the development of new ideas is a balancing act between what new hardware can bring to the table — be it two or four-person multiplayer, fully 3D character models, online multiplayer, AR racing, the list goes on — versus the realities and restrictions of that hardware.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise.

Released March 8, 2019, Devil May Cry 5 serves as a return to the classic timeline after an over-decade-long hiatus. Nero reprises his starring role, but he's joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord. Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a "homerun" with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom's…]]></summary>

Taking place from 9am until 9pm BST, the Splatfest World Premiere brings us our first taste of what Splatoon 3's Splatfests will feel like. While they look pretty similar to Splatoon 2's own, the added three-team aspect and the Tricolor Turf War are adding a decidedly purple and yellow twist.
Well, now that the Splatfest is live, why not join us? The lovely Alex, Zion, and Felix will be hopping into the demo at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, and you can watch them sling ink at the field (and others) over on YouTube!

Still, I'm all in for the aesthetic and style of Lies of P, and it's pretty funny to see Killer Klowns from Outer Space get an adaptation nobody was expecting.

While this week's Gamescom Opening Night Live and Nintendo Treehouse presentation has got us looking towards the future, you might wish to take a smaller scale approach to this weekend's gaming with both the mouse-based Islets and RITE scurrying onto Switch consoles.

The Splatfest is split into two halves - the first six hours will be dedicated to the Splatfest Battles, where it's 1-v-1 paint-splattering battles all the way. Then, for the second six hours, you'll be getting into some 4-v-2-v-2 battles with a messy triple-team battle. To join in the Splatfest, you'll need to download the Splatfest World Premiere demo and swear allegiance to one of the three teams (let us know what you're going for in our poll!).

It seems Nintendo is issuing console bans (possibly including a "total ban" from the Nintendo Switch Online service). OatmealDome goes on to explain how there was a certain patch being "shared around" that allowed players to enter the testing range early in this weekend's Splatfest demo, which has probably resulted in bans.

Deadline has revealed Netflix's live-action Resident Evil series has been axed after its first season. The streaming service will not be ordering a second season of the action-horror series based on Capcom's popular video games.
Although it debuted in the top 10 on Netflix, Resident Evil went outside of the most watched shows after only three weeks. Critics gave it 55% on Rotton Tomatoes and the audience score was 27%. In our own review here on Nintendo Life, we labelled the series "yet another misfire in the world of live-action adaptations".

Hello hello! Tonight on stream we'll be trying Thymesia, an action RPG with a plague theme and a similar feel to Dark Souls.
As an avid soulslike lover, I'm super interested, so I can't wait to share it with you guys! I think we're the perfect candidates to scope this one out. The combat system has high praise even though some reviewers have felt it falls a bit short of soulslike glory, but that comparison is difficult in the first place, so I'm excited either way.

See you tonight!

Nobody Saves the World was a fun Game Pass romp from Guacamelee's Drinkbox Studios, and it's getting a bit bigger with the upcoming Frozen Hearth DLC. The best part of the game is completing combat challenges to power up your different character forms and unlock new variations, and on that front, we're getting a killer bee and mechanic form.

Once the $4.99 DLC launches on September 13, you'll be able to compete in The Tempering, "a series of puzzles and challenges that will push players' transformation skills and creativity." And after unlocking the mechanic and bee, they'll be usable in the base game. Speaking of which, I still need to finish my New Game+ run for the platinum trophy.

Neodash is a type of racing game that pops up relatively often; a time trial crossed with an obstacle course and a little of what I suppose is the endless runner. Picture Trackmania but with the courses condensed into short bursts of high speed dodging and you're basically there. They're often very throwaway and don't really hold my interest for long. Neodash grabs hold immediately.

Embracer's acquisition was announced in May earlier this year, for a reported sum of around $300 million USD. Today, Embracer Group confirms that all conditions for the transaction, including regulatory approvals, have been fulfilled.
This purchase doesn't just include the three studios, but several notable IPs that these studios have worked on. Those include Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and The Legacy of Kain. However, Square Enix is still set to retain certain IPs.

I don’t tend to play games for escapism. The whole “escape from the world’s problems by going to a fantasy world” doesn’t work for my brain. Finding a game that actually gets me to relax is difficult. Even some games that are intended to be relaxing seem to have the opposite effect on me. What I’ve found that works are games that don’t allow me to think about anything else, such as Doom Eternal, management games, and simulators like Densha De Go 64.
I actually picked up Densha De Go 64 because I love the N64 and saw the game’s special controller. I knew I needed it. What I didn’t realize at the time was that the sound of the rail joints and the shouts of oncoming signals were the perfect mix to get me to vegetate on the couch.

During its Gamescom 2022 presentation, Capcom offered up exciting new info on its fantasy adventure, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The publisher not only dropped a release window for the expansion's next update but also treated Sunbreak fans to a fresh trailer, spotlighting the deadly Flaming Espinas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxd3Dv4LTQw
Coming late September, the flashily-monikered "Update 2" will add a selection of new beasties to the game world, all ready and raring to be placed inside your trophy cabinet, or to make you a part of theirs. Leading the pack is the Flaming Espinas, a creature first discovered in 2008 PC release Monster Hunter Frontier Season 2.0. While typical in stature to the common Espinas, this variant boasts a hazardous orange glow, warning prey that its devastating flame breath is getting set to cinder.
Along with the arrival of this scary giant, Update 2 will feature new Rare creatures as well as "powered-up variants of Sunbreak's more familiar fare. Players should also most likely expect a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug stomps, ensuring that all is well in the lands of Kamura. A third update, coming this winter, will round out Sunbreak's 2022 content, though further quests, monsters, gear, and other additions are planned for release as we head into 2023.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch.

Just a few days ago, the Smash Ultimate screen-a-day fun ended, but another journey began: a Sakurai YouTube channel. He kicked things off by posting three videos: one that introduced the channel, one that introduced himself, and another that talked about the development concept of lingering.
In just two days he's now amassed nearly 300,000 subscribers (283K at the time of publication), and has posted two more videos, which you can find below. He also has a Japanese YouTube channel, which has a comparable 246K subscribers at the time of publication. Since he provides English subtitles for his aforementioned English channel anyway while speaking in Japanese, the main difference for the latter is that the on-screen text is actually in Japanese — in addition to native language subtitles.

Kirby's Dream Land:
For five minutes, Sakurai talks about Kirby's Dream Land in the new Sakurai YouTube channel clip. The 1992 Game Boy classic kicked off the series — and was also the first game Sakurai directed!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjdmi7628GM
Frame rates:
In a topic that isn't touched upon that often by folks who work on first-party Nintendo games, Sakurai walks us through the basics of frame rates in the video game industry. Sakurai's YouTube channel video even goes into the "standard" of 30FPS and mentions Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus in his lecture.

On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feel the emotion
The Last of Us Part I hits next week, and today Naughty Dog showed off the accessibility features included in the remake. Among them is a pretty fascinating new feature for deaf players. It plays dialogue through the PlayStation 5's DualSense, letting players "feel" the delivery of dialogue.
Over on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part I game director Matthew Gallant discusses some of the new accessibility features the team has developed. The DualSense dialogue tool started out as a prototype, in fact. And during playtesting, the team at Naughty Dog found it to be really successful. The feature, when toggled on, plays dialogue through the PS5 DualSense controller via haptic feedback.
"That way a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered," said Gallant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LINKh60I8CY
Another new feature the team has is audio description for cinematics. Naughty Dog partnered with Descriptive Video Works, a service that works in TV, movies, and game trailer, to integrate audio description into cutscenes and across all localized languages.
Easing access
Alongside the new tools, The Last of Us Part I also features a ton of the accessibility features seen in Part 2. This includes vision accessibility, with tools like High Contrast Display and HUD scaling. Hearing accessibility tools are also available, adding subtitle names and direction, as well as pick-up notifications and awareness indicators.
It's nice to see Naughty Dog carry on with these features into future games. The Last of Us Part II was recognized for its accessibility features. It's cool to see developers to continue building on and prototyping new features that can only help more people engage with their games.
The Last of Us Part I hits PlayStation 5 on September 2, 2022.

In case you missed it, it's a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation of the cult 1988 horror film of the same name, but details on how its creepy clowning around would actually work were few and far between, to say the least. Thankfully, I sat in on a developer presentation earlier this week to find out exactly how it stacks up to other asymmetrical horror film games out there at the moment, as well as how it hopes to evolve and redefine the hide-and-seek genre as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian studio Konfa Games also acquired
American Publisher tinyBuild Inc, following a particularly expensive morning, has announced that it has acquired several IPs from indie studio Bossa Games. As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the memeriffic "comedy physics" titles Surgeon Simulator, I am Bread, and I am Fish were purchased by tinyBuild for an "upfront payment" of $3 million USD.
Following the closure of this purchase, tinyBuild will now manage developmental control of all three titles, while Bossa Studios will move on to new projects. Despite the relative simplicity of the games, the former Bossa franchises have raked in millions of dollars in revenue since their respective releases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6COQHqc4LE
"Since early 2022, Bossa has been focused exclusively in the genre of co-op PvE. We have been prototyping a lot, and now find ourselves in full production of titles we are pouring our hearts and souls into," writes Bossa co-founder Henrique Olifiers of the company's future. "This brought us to the question of how best to take care of our legacy, our existing games, and how to ensure they have a future of their own."
"Together with TinyBuild, we found a path that allows Bossa to dedicate its full attention to its new projects, while ensuring Surgeon Simulator, I Am Bread and I Am Fish have a new home that understands what makes these games tick as well as we do."
In addition to the Bossa IP acquisition, tinyBuild also announced that it has purchased independent Russian studio Konfa Games for $5.4 million. It is reported that the Konfa team will now relocate to tinyBuild's Serbian headquarters, where it will continue development on its current projects, including the cartoonish roguelike Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder, which is available now on PC.

Video gaming has to be one of the more expensive hobbies out there, right? Other than, like, yacht collecting or space travel, of course, but out of the normal hobbies, it's up there. Games themselves tend to cost anywhere from $20 to 80, and that's before you get into things like physical versions and collector's editions and DLC.
But retro games are even more expensive, thanks to a number of factors like rarity, age, condition, and some less-than-reputable sellers. But fear not, dear would-be collectors: Our Zion has your best interests at heart with his latest video for the NL YouTube channel, which will help you learn the tips and tricks to collecting retro games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

The summer update for Sifu goes live on August 31, and adds several new features. Gameplay modifiers are a big one, letting those who have already mastered the motions in Sifu impose even more challenge.
Sifu's new modifiers can change a number of things. Maybe it takes away guarding, or reduces your main character to a single hit point. Or maybe it makes things a bit easier, letting the player ignore enemies' guard or stopping them from picking up weapons.

I think one of the reasons I fell so hard for Animal Crossing back on the GameCube was it transported me back to a simpler era in my life. In the fall of 2002, I started my senior year of high school amongst strangers as my family moved to the area just a few weeks before. It was the third and final high school of my academic career, and while in hindsight I appreciate the fact I didn’t bother to get too close to anyone because I was zipping off to college the next year, it was a less than ideal situation for an awkward dweeb on the precipice of adulthood. That’s why I spent so many hours retreating into my Animal Crossing town, spending my evenings hanging out by the river and walking through the trees just as I did when I was a k…]]></summary>

Early reviews have been dropping all week, and while we're working on the NL verdict, we wanted to share what others think of Pac-Man's return to 3D platforming. We'll let you know what we think as soon as our review is up and ready!

The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WD Black SN770 is a good middle-of-the-road PCIe 4.0 SSD, outperforming PCIe 3.0 SSDs while costing less than the very fastest PCIe 4.0 models. It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model.

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you'd expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio's previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

Thankfully, Micro SD cards are getting extremely affordable, even in massive sizes all the way up to 1TB. Smaller sizes like 256GB and 512GB are better value per gigabyte, but today in the UK there's been a big discount on a 1TB Lexar Play Micro SD card that brings it into contention too. 
The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you'd prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

It feels like forever ago that I was clamoring for Dragon Quest X offline, and it's finally coming out: in Japan only!
You can find the trailer below, which refreshes the 2012 MMO original for its new offline packaging. If you're interested and want to pick up the Japanese version, Square Enix has a website dedicated to pre-orders. In classic Square Enix fashion there's some extras to be had, as well as the opportunity to pick up the PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch editions of the game.
As for details, it's still being billed as a single-player RPG, which kind of goes with the territory of the offline pivot. Dragon Quest X offline will arrive on September 15, 2022 in Japan, but there's also going to be an "ultra large expansion" coming in spring of 2023. The standard edition will run you roughly $60 US, while the special edition is about $115 US, and includes the expansion, physical pins, a slime mug, and a spoon for said mug. The list of in-game items can be found here.
You can also go for the digital deluxe edition that nets you the core game and the expansion for about $95 US. Options! Well, for folks who want to pick up the Japanese edition of the game, at least.

Capcom has started to reveal its itinerary for the upcoming Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2022 event, which is scheduled to take place next month at Chiba City's Makuhari Messe complex. In addition to appearances from Resident Evil Village, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, and Exoprimal, Capcom will also be bringing a brand new build of its incoming blockbuster, Street Fighter 6.
The new build will differ from that currently being courted at Gamescom, Summer Game Fest, and VS Fighting in that it will feature playable appearances from characters Guile, Juri, and Kimberly, joining the previous demo's roster of Ryu, Luke, Chun-Li, and Jamie for a flashy roster count of seven World Warriors. This will give TGS attendees a world-first opportunity to check out the three new characters, something which isn't leaving yer boy seething with envy in any manner whatsoever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGuVJXwENQk
In addition to the new Street Fighter 6 demo, Capcom will also be holding two live streams across the duration of the show. The first is the Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program, which will look at all of Capcom's other incoming releases, (though the publisher has confirmed Resident Evil 4 will not be in attendance at TGS 2022). The second stream, Tokyo Game Show Street Fighter 6 Special Program, will be focused purely on the new slugger, and is expected to feature at least one new character reveal trailer. Exciting stuff!
Of course, for those not in attendance, LIKE ME, all of the pertinent news for Street Fighter 6 and all other titles being showcased at TGS will be reported right here on Destructoid. While the remainder of 2022 is looking like something of a quiet year for big releases, there's no denying that 2023 is shaping up pretty nicely, and TGS will only add fuel to that hype fire.
Tokyo Game Show 2022 will take place at Makuhari Messe between September 15-18.

In a tweet, the streaming service announced that the upcoming adaptation would be directed by Francis Lawrence — whose past credits include I Am Legend and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire — with an original script written by Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Michael Green — known for his work on Logan and Blade Runner 2049.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has "no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The power of Piglins.
Nintendo has shared a new look at Mojang's much-anticipated Minecraft Legends across its social channels, this time introducing us to a clan of fiery creatures who we can only assume will be your central opponents in the game. Seriously, have you ever seen a good guy living in a castle of flames?
The trailer carries some serious Lord of the Rings vibes, as an ominous narrator speaks over images of a blocky hero on horseback riding into battle against a hoard of Piglins (yes, the baddies are pigs in helmets). This mostly cinematic section gives a good idea of the fantasy feeling that the action strategy spin-off is looking to hit, with huge castles and battles seeming to be the defining feature of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft Legends was first announced at Geoff Fest earlier this year, and a smidge more footage dropped again at a Nintendo Direct Mini. But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there's been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.
Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft's colourful cube-verse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight years ago Graham (who used to be to blame for all of this) got hands-on with Dead Island 2, back when the game was being developed by Yager, the folks behind Spec Ops: The Line. Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

This statement follows the news that Sony would be increasing the price of both PlayStation models in the UK, Europe, Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, and Canada due to "challenging market conditions" (thanks, Push Square!). Now Nintendo has reassured customers that it doesn't plan on mirroring Sony's actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The below gameplay trailer debuted ahead of TGS
TGS (Tokyo Game Show) is scheduled to take place from September 15 through September 18 of this year, and Koei Tecmo is bringing Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Before the event, we're getting a taste of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gameplay, which is a nice surprise after the cinematic reveal at the summer Microsoft game showcase. The bosses and environments so far look worthy of the Nioh series, which is a good sign.
In addition to the footage, Koei Tecmo shared a few scarce details, like the existence of the "five phases" battle style mechanic, as well as the use of offensive and defensive maneuvers (which seems to be a huge focus of the system). We also got reconfirmation of a whole bunch of housekeeping stuff. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will launch on PC (Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in "early 2023." It's also confirmed as a console and PC Game Pass title.
If you're attending TGS, there's a few bonuses involved for those of you who can check it out physically. If you play the game in any capacity, you'll get a "button badge" for Wo Long. If you finish the demo, you'll get a t-shirt (while supplies last, Koei Tecmo points out). We'll also get footage of a "never before seen stage" at the event from the game's producers (Fumihiko Yasuda and Masaaki Yamagiwa). That'll all be at the Koei Tecmo Games booth (Hall 3, Makuhari Messe). The stream will also be taking place on Friday, September 16, at 7:20PM JST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another two RPG classics to dive into, dood!
The Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volumes 1 and Volume 2 each brought a different pair of games to Switch. The third volume brings a PlayStation classic to modern consoles as well as the Western debut of an obscure but well-loved game in the NIS stable. Die-hard tactical RPG fans might have heard of La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, but they will likely be new to many fans. Fortunately, these pair of adventures manage to mostly hit the right notes even if many of their conventions and mechanics are dated.
The La Pucelle: Ragnarok half of Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 3 sends players to a world filled with French puns and culinary references. It follows the story of Prier and Culotte as they take on the job of hunting demons for the Church of the Holy Maiden. Prier is almost overly aggressive in her desire to become the next Maiden of Light, a heroic figure said to return to the world to restore balance when she is needed most. Culotte is her long-suffering younger brother who begrudgingly puts up with his sister’s antics.

The financial analysts at CNBC have shot down circulating rumors that retail giant Amazon is preparing to announce that it has purchased legendary developer/publisher Electronic Arts (EA).
Stories of the acquisition began circulating within the last hour, which understandably caused an immediate spike in EA stock value. Since then, however, "industry sources" speaking with CNBC's David Faber stated that such a deal has not been struck, nor has Amazon even made a bid toward EA in regard to purchasing the studio. Bloomberg Terminal has similarly doubted the claim.
The initial story, posted by USA Today, cited that Amazon had already tabled an offer to the FIFA, Madden, and Mass Effect studio with an eye to acquiring the publisher and its IP catalog. Speaking fairly, USA Today rumors are believable, given ongoing whispers that EA is one of many major gaming studios looking to sell up. When recent, industry-shaking acquisitions involving companies such as Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax/Bethesda are also taken into account, huge transactions such as the one rumored this morning are far more credible than they once might have been.
This breaking news story continues to unfold this morning. But, even as mere minutes pass, it seems more and more likely that the Amazon/EA purchase rumor is, at this stage, unfounded.

Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can resume previously regular dueling activities
It looks like Dark Souls 3 PC players will be able to engage with the online side of its content again. Online features for the PC version of Dark Souls 3 went back online today.
The news was made known through the Dark Souls Twitter account today. The Souls team is also working to restore these features for all other Dark Souls titles, as it looks like only the third is back right now. An announcement will be made when those services are back online.
https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1562718968086872064
The PC servers for Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 have been offline for quite some time. They were taken down after a severe exploit was uncovered in these games. An RCE exploit in Dark Souls 3 let players run malicious code, creating a pretty serious vulnerability. Players drew attention to it, and the exploit was enough to yank down the servers for all three games on PC. Console servers, meanwhile, have stayed online.
Calling in online assistance
While we've been getting steady updates on the status of these servers, it's nice to see at least one of the games back. Online features are a pretty big part of the Souls experience, ranging from PvP to calling in assistance and leaving messages.
Meanwhile, Elden Ring has been top-of-mind for pretty much all of 2022. The same exploit was investigated and taken care of in Elden Ring, so those servers have stayed online through the whole ordeal.
While it might seem like players would still gravitate towards the newcomer in Elden Ring, it's good to have these online features back up for Dark Souls 3. Newcomers who bought into Elden Ring may wish to go back and explore earlier titles, and hopefully they'll be able to do it as originally intended. No timeline's been made public on when the PC online features for Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2 will be back.

Earlier today, news broke that Sony would be bumping up the price of the PlayStation 5 in some regions. And as some have wondered whether Microsoft will follow suit, it looks like that won't be the case.
A Microsoft representative told Windows Central that there are no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S consoles. These will stay at their current price point in their respective currencies; $299 for the Series S, and $499 for the Xbox Series X.
"We are constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans great gaming options," the spokesperson told Windows Central. "Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) the Xbox Series X is $499 (£450, €500)."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's your chance to get the latest Tomb Raider title for free
It's hard to keep up with all the awesome new releases in games, but sometimes, you just gotta throw it all to the wind and play an old favorite. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider reboot series, and you're looking for a gritty adventure game to sink your teeth into, you're in luck, because Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on the Epic Games Store for September.
Shadow of the Tomb Raider was originally released back in 2018 as the third game in the reboot trilogy and the twelfth mainline Tomb Raider game. The game's events take place a year after the events of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out in 2015, and finds Lara Croft racing against the clock to prevent the world from ending yet again. Arguably the darkest game in the series yet, it explores themes of descension, both through Lara's personality and the jungle itself.

The story is based on both Mayan and Aztec mythologies, and in creating the game, Square Enix devs consulted with historians to create the architecture and people of the legendary city Paititi. Fun fact: the game is still sitting at number seven on the list of most expensive games ever made, after adjusting for inflation.
Submerged: Hidden Depths is the other free-to-download title paired with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Epic Games Store. It's a relaxing exploration sim that has players uncovering the ruins of a beautiful, sunken world. If you want a more chill exploration-based gaming experience, it sounds like it's thematically fairly close to the Tomb Raider series, so it could be a fun one to try out.
The games are available for free download on the Epic Games Store starting September 1, so make sure to grab the roguelike "card crawler" Ring of Pain before it leaves the rotation next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The LG C2 OLED probably isn't your first thought when you're considering a new desktop monitor, but its incredible image quality and new smaller 42-inch or 48-inc sizes make it a surprisingly valid choice. Right now you can pick up this monitor in either size for under £1000, depending on where you shop, a price that puts it make more affordable than smaller monitors with worse HDR performance - and that makes it well worth considering.

The Nintendo Treehouse went live today with a special stream highlighting two upcoming Switch games. First up was Splatoon 3, which got a big showcase of not just its single-player campaign, but some of its new weapons.
The Treehouse team set about tackling some levels in Splatoon 3 that were largely spoiler-free, outside of general locale information. The first few segments are absolutely some familiar Splatoon multiplayer. Blast some ink, jet along the course, take out the bad guys, and reach the goal.
What caught my eye right away was some of the new Splatoon 3 weapons the team spotlighted. The Splatana, an ink-launching katana, looks really great in motion. It's got different fire modes for different situations, and feels like an interesting evolution of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

Publisher MAGES has announced that the upcoming double pack of Tachyon shmups Bullet Soul and sequel Bullet Soul: Infinite Burst has been hit with a small delay and will now launch on Nintendo Switch September 29, a little over a fortnight later than its initially stated launch of September 9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMiWfkUfxZw
Originally released on Xbox 360 in 2011 and 2014, the Bullet Soul titles espouse the frantic bullet hell action, pulse-pounding soundtrack, and goofy anime aesthetics that are so embedded in the modern shmup market. Several notable industry veterans were involved in the game's development, with music provided by composers Kenji Ito (Romancing SaGa) and Kohata Takahashi (Ridge Racer) and colorful character art daubed by Monogatari's Akio Watanabe
Available on PC since 2017, the new Nintendo Switch port of the two titles will be the Bullet Soul series' first international console release. In Japan, the Bullet Soul Double Pack will also receive a physical edition, which comes complete with an art book and soundtrack CD. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to bring this edition of the game to western shores.
Bullet Soul and Bullet Soul: Infinite Burst will launch digitally on Nintendo Switch September 29.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix signs on some notable talent for the underwater story
The BioShock film adaptation has found its director and scriptwriter. Netflix confirms today that I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence will be the BioShock director, with a script written by Michael Green.
Lawrence has a pretty solid list of action-thrillers on his resume, including I Am Legend and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Meanwhile, Green has penned scripts for Logan, Blade Runner 2049, and American Gods.
https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1562864632708050945
These two will be tackling a live-action adaptation of the BioShock franchise. It's unclear which parts of that franchise will be adapted, but the Big Daddy is featured in Netflix's promos so far. It seems like an underwater venture seems like a safe bet.
 Would you kindly pass the remote?
Netflix also announced some more news for its ongoing video game adaptations, locking in The Umbrella Academy showrunner Steve Blackman for the development of its Horizon Zero Dawn series. Alongside Castlevania, Tekken, and more, that's a lot of adaptations for Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3RXpEXA0jw
And there are even more if you take a look around the entertainment industry. Sony is heavily developing several different projects, including reports of Days Gone and Gravity Rush movies. Sonic the Hedgehog is doing well at the box office.
Basically, get ready for a lot of video game adaptations. It seems like the dam is open, and they're all going to flood in soon. At the very least for the BioShock film, this is a good pairing of writer and director. I've enjoyed a good chunk of their previous work, and they seem like a pairing that could tackle something like BioShock in an interesting way.
And hey, this news plus the recent 15th anniversary make for a good excuse to revisit BioShock. Here's hoping we get to see a Big Daddy on the screen soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

The singleplayer spaceship shooter hit Game Pass in June, and all you need to know is: once you power through the boring bit, you get to play as a spacewitch pilot who fights with guns and magic while weaving through the innards of battleships and megastructures. It's one of those good 7/10 games.

You can now fly over Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne. They’re rendered with the fancy photogrammetry technique that’s already plonked hundred of cities into Flight Simulator’s rendition of Earth. 


That means that you can zoom over Koelnmesse, which is where Gamescom’s happening right bloomin’ now. Nice bit of Inception-style weirdness there, Microsoft Flight Simulator devs. I’ll give it a go later and see if I can spot our roving reporter Ed. Witness the realism for yourself by watching the trailer below, like some kind of human aircraft gliding above.

Matthew isn't here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

I managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it's shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I've got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror," explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new," Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.

Attackers "executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player's PC." But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn't have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too.

I've felt proud a number of times at this year's Gamescom so far, marked first by an excellent McDonald's choice (honey crisp chicken and bacon) on the first evening, followed by a doner kebab that put it to shame. And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.
The bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we'd accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.

Last night also saw the reveal of the Samsung 990 Pro SSD, a premium designed-for-gaming drive with read speeds up to 7450MB/s – nudging the theoretical limits of its PCIe 4.0 interface. If it actually reaches such speeds in the wild, once it launches in October, that would make it the fastest consumer PCIe 4.0 drive yet. And write speeds aren’t far behind either, at up to 6900MB/s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dark Pictures Anthology returns this November with The Devil In Me, which serves as the season finale for the franchise (until the next batch of games arrive). A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.
The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. 


The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can get a better sense of the game's narrative by watching this recent story trailer.]]></summary>

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's normally World War II that's the 20th century conflict of choice for strategy games these days (see the upcoming Company Of Heroes 3 and Men Of War 2), but the freshly-announced RTS The Great War: Western Front will be eschewing tradition by putting us in the shoes of Allied or Central Power forces from World War I. Coming in 2023 from publishers Frontier Foundry and the developers behind the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, let's have a watch of its reveal trailer below.

That’d be publisher Frontier Foundry, who shared another look at the recently delayed sci-fi space adventure Deliver Us Mars this evening as part of Gamescom's Future Games Show. I thought there’d be more imposing planetary locales to navigate in this sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, and there are, but I wasn’t prepared for a whole bunch of astronauts running about being dramatic. Clue yourself in on what’s happening on Mars by watching the trailer below.

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested. 


Minecraft Legends is a third-person real-time action strategy game. Yeah, that’s a lot of keywords, but I promise the game is easier to understand than you think…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.]]></summary>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …]]></summary>

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.
After some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.
During my 75-minute hands-on session, I was able to check out the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morty Smith from the popular cartoon Rick & Morty is now a playable character in the free-to-play stage fighter, MultiVersus. 
This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm "Armothy" and the "Plumbus" all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


"Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve," a press release reads. "Morty's moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm 'Armothy' and 'Plumbus' all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles."
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.
For more, check out every character nerf and buff from the big MultiVersus Season 1 update, and then read about how Black Adam and Stripe from Gremlins are coming to the game this season at some point. Check out our thoughts on the game in the Game Informer MultiVersus review after that, and then read about how MultiVersus was July's best-selling game in the U.S. thanks to its Founder's Pack.

Until now, most of their cloud ambitions have been neatly contained in the console space, but today Samsung have unveiled their latest cloud-enabled PC monitors, presumably in the hope that the combination of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia's GeForce Now, Stadia, Utomik and Amazon Luna services inside their integrated Samsung Gaming Hubs will be enough to convince folks to part with their towers once and for all.

Think of all the dirt and clumps of dust you’d be grossed out by, and don't even get me started about being outside. Giant horrific insects? No thanks. I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).
Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don't say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.

The Indonesian team have now terminated their contract with PQube and delayed A Space For The Unbound until they can find another publisher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only Zelda game I've played was Link's Awakening, on the Game Boy. I do not feel short changed by this. In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series' essence.
That essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic "going on an adventure" sense rather than the "rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again" genre sense.
You're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often that we get to report a game coming out earlier than planned rather than delaying the date, so it's nice to be able to tell you that Gotham Knights has moved its release date up. It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portable monitors are pretty awesome - they're an easy way to get a dual screen setup going on a laptop, and also work well to expand the Steam Deck's rather modest screen into something a little more co-op friendly. Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S'been a while since we've had a proper in-depth theme park sim, hasn't it? Park Beyond was revealed almost exactly a year ago, when the devs also talked a lot about the concept of "impossification", but it's been all quiet on the rollercoaster front since then. Tonight, at the Opening Night Live marking the start of Gamescom, we saw a shiny new trailer showing off some of the building tools and wacky modules you can build into your coasters.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/dead-island-2-gets-long-awaited-trailer-and-release-date"/>
        <updated>2022-08-23T20:17:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”
Dead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.]]></summary>

Brainwash Gang, the makers of narrative language game Grotto, unveiled their next project this evening at Geoff Keighley's Opening Night Live showcase, and it's a funky, vibrant, online deckbuilding FPS called Friends Vs Friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A product description for The Outlast Trials says players can expect "mind-numbing terror," and that's exactly what we see in the game's newest trailer. Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.
The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale is known for choice-driven storytelling, and yet, the first trailer for The Expanse focuses entirely on action. As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.
The Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Killer Klowns From Outer Space, the science fiction comedy horror from the late 80s, made a surprise crash landing during today’s Gamescom showcase. Believe it or not, the cult classic film is getting a game adaptation.


The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: "In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye." Sounds spooky. 
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," a press release reads. "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre." 
Shortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs," Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. "Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today." 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Squanch Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person shooter High On Life, and this time, we get to watch our protagonist take down a boss. 
This trailer, which aired during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, highlights a fight between our protagonist and their loud-mouthed weapons and 9-Torg, an alien boss. The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you'll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13. 
For more, watch the High On Life reveal trailer from earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.]]></summary>

Beyond that, I'm not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as "an original multi-world experience" that "will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world".
So it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.

Circle September 17 as the day you can enjoy Ron Gilbert’s latest entry in the beloved adventure franchise, which sees hero Guybrush Threepwood on a quest to finally discover the secret to the famous island once and for all. It may sport a striking new art style but features the adventure game mechanics fans know and love. 
Best of all, those who pre-order the game, which is coming to PC and Switch, will be rewarded with a set of horse armor! Yes, really! It’s absolutely useless and just occupies inventory space, but it’s a nice gag nonetheless. Check out the new trailer below.]]></summary>

It’s an oversimplification, but if the idea captures your imagination, you recognize why the developers at Unknown Worlds think they’ve hit on something special. Best known for Subnautica, the team has been quietly working on a wholly digital miniatures game for the last five years. Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games. After over an hour checking out the result, I’m convinced Unknown Worlds is onto something.

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said "a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.
I admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a super in-depth look at Sonic Frontiers earlier this summer when I traveled to Sonic Team and played the game for more than three hours. Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.
Revealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.


Sega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.
Sonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. For more in-depth Sonic Frontiers coverage, head to our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol graced the cover of our magazine a few months ago and is currently one of the most anticipated games of the year. Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” 


Protagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. 
In the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.
The Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.]]></summary>

Perhaps most importantly, it also highlights just how similar this is to Telltale's beloved Borderlands narrative-driven adventure game.

The trailer was revealed during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and while it didn't feature much by way of gameplay, it did give us plenty of new glimpses of magic. In particular, it showed us that we might have access to unforgivable curses such as the Cruciatus Curse in the game. Crucio is essentially a curse that allows you to torture whomever or whatever you use it on – it's very much of the Dark Arts side of magic and as the name suggests, hard to forget and even harder to forgive in the world of Harry Potter.

The trailer tells us little to nothing about the game. It shows a character staring down onto a vast desert while narration waxes poetic about overcoming fear. Then, a giant sandworm comes forth from the ground below, and our character jumps down to face the gigantic beast. Check out the trailer below:


While the trailer didn't reveal much, a press release distributed after the fact did. Here's what it had to say:

Dune: Awakening isn't the only game coming out on the heels of last year's mega-blockbuster Dune adaptation. Back in April, Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game, was released in early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over three million copies sold, 2014's Lords of the Fallen was destined for a sequel. Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.
Set one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative." The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of "devastating magic."
While we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market. What are you hoping to see from the sequel? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Everywhere’s reveal trailer showed a montage of disparate gameplay and art styles, from more cartoony racing to sci-fi to realistic human characters. As its name implies, Everywhere hopes to offer a variety of experiences both user-created and otherwise. Its newly launched website offers this description:
“Everywhere seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience that redefines how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.”
“Our intent has always been to push the boundaries of what a videogame can be while still delivering an innovative player-first experience,” said Benzies. “The team we’ve built and the partners we’ve made since our founding are coalescing around the unique vision we’re bringing to life. It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”
Everywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie announced that Destiny 2 is heading to the Epic Games Store beginning today. The new partnership with Epic also means that the series will be invading two of the publisher's most popular multiplayer games: Fortnite and Fall Guys. 


You can download Destiny 2 on the Epic Store right now, and those that do before August 30 can claim the 30th Anniversary Pack for free. This pack, which was released last December for $24.99, contains the Gjallarhorn Exotic Rocket Launcher, Thorn armor set, a new three-player dungeon, in addition to other goodies. 
Today at 5 p.m. Pacific, Fortnite players can purchase the skins of Ikora, Zavala, and the Exo Stranger, their weapons, and can even drop into the island atop a Sparrow. A new Fortnite island inspired by the Javelin-4 Crucible map is available now and features control-style gameplay. On the flip side, Fortnite ornament sets can be obtained in Destiny 2. 
On September 17, Destiny 2 invades Fall Guys with Guardian-inspired cosmetics, spicy ramen celebration emote, and other accessories. 
Will you be picking up Destiny 2 on the Epic Store, or donning your favorite Guardian's outfit in Fortnite/Fall Guys? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nintendo Treehouse Live is set to air this week, and it will focus on fleshing out more of Splatoon 3's offerings and provide a new look at the upcoming Harvestella. The event takes place on Thursday, August 25, at 9:30 a.m. Pacific/12:30 p.m. Eastern and airs on Nintendo's YouTube channel. 
Splatoon 3, which recently had a dedicated Direct presentation, gets another spotlight focusing on its single-player campaign. Nintendo promises a “deep-dive” look at the story mode, which has only been lightly touched on up to this point. Additionally, the presentation will unveil the arenas available in the Splatfest World Premiere demo that goes live on August 27.
We’ll also see fresh gameplay for Harvestella, Square Enix’s promising-looking action RPG meets farming simulator that arrives to Switch (and PC) on November 4. 
Get ready for a Nintendo Treehouse: Live presentation on 8/25 at 9:30am PT featuring 3 segments:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel a bit deceived by Saints Row at the moment. Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.
Some of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: "Coming early 2023." You can see the corresponding tweet below.
Coming early 2023. #PSVR2 pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt
August 22, 2022
While the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. 
According to our very own Marcus Stewart, "VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate."
PSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?


People who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling ("more spooky than outright horror," as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as "Aftermath".
But the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a "Mostly Negative" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.

Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
