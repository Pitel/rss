        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think they'll follow through?
In case you missed it, Take-Two's newest financial report had a lot of bullish claims, championed by current CEO Strauss Zelnick. In addition to targeting an unprecedented amount of revenue in FY2025, some concerns were raised over specific platforms: most notably, the Switch, and a potential shift to updated current-gen consoles.
Speaking to Gamesindustry.biz, Zelnick notes that they're putting a lot on the line when it comes to their "immersive core" games, which currently consist of WWE 2K24, NBA 2K24...and an "eagerly-anticipated new IP from one of [their] premiere studios." But what about the Switch? Well, that's TBD.
There is...something there, at least. LEGO 2K Drive does indeed launch today on Switch, with the dubious Star Wars Hunters coming later this year following a delay. When asked about future support in FY2025, Zelnick gave a rather muted response, noting: "Yes, I think we'll continue to support it." When pressed about a potential "console refresh" (read: a boosted/souped-up theoretical Xbox Series X or PS5 "Pro"), Zelnick said that "we probably will" see it happen, and that "they [console refreshes] did not affect the business very much," referring to the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. The Zynga acquisition and faith in the mobile market are also a heavy focus for Take-Two going into the next few fiscal years.
Well, with all that info, it seems like we know where 2K stands going forward. They're taking a "wait and see" approach with Switch, they're focusing on PC, mobile, and Sony/Microsoft consoles, and they won't change much strategically if there's another "half-generation bump." So mostly business as usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.
The year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.

It turns out that in the week since the game's release, many, many people have become enamoured with a character other than the gorgeous Gerudo and it is none other than everyone's favourite tech lab director, Purah.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were having issues with The Closed Door, update your game
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out, and it's wowing people with its relatively stable performance, despite its massive additions to the core world map of Hyrule. That said there are still some lingering issues to address, and thankfully, they've been minor thus far.
Version 1.1.1 was released late on May 18, and it fixes a progress-blocking issue with the main story quest The Closed Door. Apparently, some folks were having problems with it "even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest," but now that's fixed, among the classic vague "several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience" line from Nintendo.
Without spoiling anything, The Closed Door is a very early game quest, so if it's bugged, it's super annoying. At the very least it's easy to just do a clean wipe and restart, but simply updating your game to version 1.1.1 is the ideal situation.
You can find the full patch notes below!
Ver. 1.1.1 (Released May 18, 2023) [Full patch notes]
General Updates
Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.

If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.
Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Positively shocking.
Confusion abounds with this one. This isn’t the same Shockman that was originally released for the TurboGrafx-16 back in 1991, which was a localisation of Japan's Shubibinman 2. This, Cyber Citizen Shockman, is a new 2023 translation of the original Shubibinman game from 1989; and frankly, that’s the most special thing about it.
Here a map overworld offers a choice of multiple paths, each leading to a very brief platforming stage scattered with enemies and pitfalls to leap over and avoid. Each has a boss, ranging from nice-looking mecha-styled things or well-rendered monsters, requiring little except rapid spamming early-on, and more concerted strategy later, depending on your health. Visiting the map screen offers up brief dialogue exchanges and the option to heal yourself or buy weapon upgrades with gold acquired during the stage. Deaths will slightly penalise your gold bounty, but hostages you save with each boss defeat also offer transient bonuses, health-ups, and occasionally become permanent map fixtures, like the dedicated healing nurse. Boosting weapon power is your modus operandi, eventually acquiring the chargeable Shockbeam - an addition that makes things much more enjoyable and shifts your approach to enemy negotiations.

I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.


As you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?

From what we have seen so far, the bug seemingly granted a faulty "None" reward upon completing the battle, with the game crashing immediately afterwards. This appears to have affected all of the events running this weekend including today's 5-Star Great Tusk and Iron Treads event as well as the re-run of the 7-Star Chesnaught Tera Raid Battles. The Pokémon Company has pulled all of the above as a precaution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free is free and spooky shooter Metro: Last Light is currently free to keep from Steam. It has been made available by developers 4A Games in order to celebrate its 10th anniversary. The catch, sort of, is that this is the Complete Edition, a version that does not normally even show up in Steam search results. The slightly-improved Metro: Last Light Redux will still cost you a few quid or bucks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even more wizards and legends
The spellcasting roguelite Wizard of Legend is getting a sequel. Wizard of Legend II is a follow-up to 2018's Wizard of Legend, and it's shifting from 2D to 3D.
Announced during today's Humble Games Showcase 2023, Wizard of Legend II is being published by Humble and developed by Dead Mage, the studio behind Children of Morta. The publisher confirmed during today's showcase that Wizard of Legend is now a Humble-owned IP. Original Wizard of Legend developer Contingent99 is "on board" and consulting on the project, according to Humble.
One big difference between Wizard of Legend II and its predecessor is in their style. While you still have the robed rogue mage look, the sequel is opting for an overhead 3D view rather than the pixel 2D style from the first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdnI5FGQ2Sg
It sounds like other elements remain similar, though. Up to four players can hop in, maintaining the co-op appeal of the first Wizard of Legend. It's a roguelite adventure, with plenty of spell combinations to explore and interactions to discover. The adventure seems to evolve each time, so it's once again aiming for a run-based dungeon dive.
Becoming legend
There's no planned release date at this point in time, just a confirmation that it's in development and a Steam page. I did like the original Wizard of Legend, so I'm curious to see what Dead Mages makes with the franchise.
I'm also curious to see what Contingent99 could get up to, as well. As much as I like a new take on the Wizard of Legend, Contingent99's action and art were a solid mix. I'm hopeful that team's got something in the works, too.
You can follow and wishlist Wizard of Legend II here.

PowerWash Simulator is heading to an interesting place to be power washing: an underwater locale. A SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack will arrive this summer for PowerWash Simulator, bringing the serene cleaning simulation to Bikini Bottom.
The pack was created in collaboration with Nickelodeon, and will include a character model makeover to make the player fit in a bit more with the ocean-floor setting. No exact date has been set yet, but PowerWash Simulator's SpongeBob pack will arrive sometime this summer for $7.99.
Six new maps will arrive as part of the pack. They'll spotlight Conch Street, the Bikini Bottom Bus, the Krusty Krab, the Mermalair, and more. There will also be ten achievements to hunt, and it seems like there's some story behind all the muck that's appeared in Bikini Bottom.

If nautical clean-up be something you wish
Developer FuturLab says we'll hear more about a release date sometime in the coming weeks, so we'll hopefully know soon when the cleaning crew can head underwater. Still, washing-underwater situation aside, this is a pretty interesting crossover.
Honestly, PowerWash Simulator has really been landing some wild crossovers. It wasn't that long ago that the Final Fantasy VII Remake pack went live. Now, we're going from Midgar to Bikini Bottom. And I've heard fairly good things about the crossovers thus far, too.
PowerWash Simulator really became a surprise hit, finding a chill vibe in a slow, methodical simulator. It's nice to see the team continue adding wild new reasons to keep going back to it.
The SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack for PowerWash Simulator will arrive for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch sometime this summer.

Some good news for fans of the fun and suitably silly animated series, Sonic Prime — Netflix has confirmed that a new season of episodes will be premiering on the streaming service this July.
Premiering back in December of last year, Sonic Prime sees Sonic the Hedgehog thrust into a multiverse known as the "Shatterverse" whereupon he embarks on a series of adventures with various alt-reality versions of his dopey friends, including Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, and Rogue.
The first season of dimension-hopping escapades saw The Blue Blur visiting a futureworld, the prehistoric era, a pirate world, and more. Also featured in the series was an entire cavalcade of Dr. Robotnik variants, which had all formed a council with to take over the entire Shatterverse.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1658852487854473217?s=20
Running for eight episodes, the show was considered a hit by the Sonic the Hedgehog community, with critics and fans praising the style, animation, scripting. and voice acting on offer, even if the writing was criticized for being a little trite and repetitive. A co-production of Netflix Animation, WildBrain Studios, and Man of Action Entertainment, a total of 24 episodes were commissioned in all, which suggests the new season will feature a further eight adventures, with the remain eight to be screened later this year.
Sonic Prime Season 2 premieres exclusively on Netflix on July 13. Season One is available to watch now.

We're back on for a hoppin' eShop week everyone! Following Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and...pretty much nothing else, two marquee games are featured this week, including LEGO 2K Drive (which we'll have a review of shortly!), plus Convergence: A League of Legends Story.
Of course, some of these game titles just beg to be followed up on, and this week it's "911 Cannibal." Here's the elevator pitch: "In this horror game you are a kidnapped teenager. Maniac - cannibal keeps you in his creepy house. Hide and search items that can help you find a way out of the scary place and survive the nightmare. Solve puzzles to get to inaccessible places.

The latest Japanese charts are in, and to no one's surprise, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has come out on top this week. Not only that, but much like the the UK, Breath of the Wild has also benefited from a tasty boost in sales to come in at number three.
Elsewhere, the only non-Switch game this week is Hogwarts Legacy on the PS4. Only time will tell if the Switch version proves to be as popular, but we'll have to wait until November to find out. We've also got the usual big-hitters like Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe at number four, and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet at number five.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game is afoot
Playstack and Color Gray Games' The Case of the Golden Idol is heading to Nintendo Switch. The detective game will arrive on Nintendo's handheld console next week on May 25, 2023.
Both the base game and the recently released DLC, Golden Idol Mysteries: The Spider of Lanka, will be coming to the Switch eShop. The Case of the Golden Idol will go for $17.99, while The Spider of Lanka DLC will cost $5.99.
Publisher Playstack has put up a trailer, showing a little bit about what the game's about and how the Switch version will handle Golden Idol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shlRIGFUfYc
The Case of the Golden Idol is a detective game where the player is taken through a series of vignettes. Each one centers around a gruesome death, as well as a golden idol that seems to be causing quite a ruckus. The player has to observe the scene, pulling keywords from text and other sources to then fill in answers about what's happened.
Whodunnit?
Color Gray Games' mystery has some clear similarities to games like Return of the Obra Dinn. It's pretty open in terms of letting the player try, fail, and try again to solve the mystery, but having a definite set of options and clear framework might help less investigatively-inclined folks solve their way through it.
I played The Case of the Golden Idol last year in a Discord server with friends, and I can't recommend that format enough. It's an enjoyable game to think through and solve together, and the revelations you uncover case-over-case are pretty great. The art style of Golden Idol is also unlike most other games out there; initially, I was a bit hesitant about it. But over time, the look of Golden Idol grew on me. I haven't played the Spider of Lanka DLC yet, but it's good to see this team is still exploring the world and structures it built for Golden Idol.
The Case of the Golden Idol hits Nintendo Switch on May 25.

The usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.

Devolver Digital has today announced that the diorama-set creature battler Bleak Sword DX will be swinging its way onto the Nintendo Switch from 8th June.
The title first appeared on Apple Arcade back in 2019, and we were impressed by what we saw when it was first announced for the Switch in February of this year. The new release date trailer (above) has us equally intrigued, showing the kind of lo-fi dioramas that you will have to fight through on your quest.

We (attempt to) talk about our favourite Zelda games of the past, our favourite Zelda-likes on PC, and I explain how Tears Of The Kingdom works to Nate and James. Honestly though, we don't make it very far, because it turns out the lads haven't ever played a Zelda game before. At least, Nate might have. We're not entirely sure. 


We do also talk about what we've been playing this week as well - which include some old favourites, some new secrets, and Gaben's tiny hands - and give some great new recommendations. Nate also delivers a very involved mini-game involving beans and aliens, and James doesn't talk about the Asus ROG Ally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Case of the Golden Idol was one of 2022’s best hidden gems that only PC players have been able to enjoy. Fortunately, Switch owners can put on their thinking hats when the dark mystery game heads to the platform next week.
On May 25, The Case of the Golden Idol lands on Switch alongside its recently released expansion, The Spider of Lanka. Both titles can be purchased separately or together in a bundle. The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. 
The Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.


As a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit. Will you be giving the game a shot on Switch? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

No More Robots has announced that the FPS spin-off of Hypnospace Outlaw has a release date. Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is dropping on June 1st.
Hypnospace Outlaw was an extremely special game. While it took place in a fantasy reality, it created a loving time capsule of Web 1.0. The developers created various fictional characters to present a very accurate depiction of the internet in its awkward adolescence. It was rather spot on, and I know this because I lived Web 1.0.
One of the characters was this edgy teenager called Zane Lofton. Like many teenagers, Zane lived in a self-centered fantasy land where he was the king of cool. Slayers X is a further exploration of that character, this time through an FPS that he and his friend developed. It looks to drag us by the hair right back to 1998 when teenagers tinkered with Doom and Duke Nukem 3D modding tools.
I also did that, but I wasn’t a teenager yet, so nothing ever came of it aside from a few poorly textured rooms.
https://youtu.be/-bZRPUTNJBc
Zane Rocks
We’ve had plenty of shooters try to recapture the ‘90s to varying degrees of success, but Slayers X might be the first one to try to present itself through the lens of a character living at the time. As such, it’s packed with everything edgy teenagers found cool back then: bad guys, real-world environments, and poop. It’s trite and tacky, and that’s exactly how it should be.
As a fan of everything jank-pop, Slayers X absolutely sings to me. Hypnospace Outlaw still lives in a corner of my brain, and I’ve been excited to see more from the concept. The spin-off was announced a while back, and I was recently wondering if I had somehow missed it. I’m glad that’s not the case, and I can resume being excited.
Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer releases on PC June 1. It will also be on Xbox Game Pass the same day.

Towards the end of last year, many of us donned our stovepipe hats and set about solving a series of grisly murders in 18th-century England in The Case of the Golden Idol on PC. At the time, we kept our fingers firmly crossed that the game would be making its way over to Switch (it even made our list of Switch ports we'd love to see in 2023), and now our wishes have been granted.
Yes, if the headline of this piece wasn't enough of a giveaway, Playstack and Color Gray Games have today announced that The Case of the Golden Idol will be heading to Switch. What's more, it's getting released next week on 25th May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen is coming this October, and despite the good news it lands on the unluckiest day of the year. Thankfully, a lengthy trailer gives us the good fortune of enjoying some action-packed gameplay footage. 
This reimagining/reboot of its 2014 predecessor is coming on Friday, October 13. A big new trailer set to Iron Maiden packs in a ton of metal-infused action that shows off the game's Unreal Engine 5-rendered graphics. 


It's been a long road for Lords of the Fallen, which began life as Lords of the Fallen 2 years ago before development restarted from scratch. It was re-announced as The Lords of the Fallen last year before reverting back to its original name. The Souls-inspired game's open world is five times larger than the original's and supports online co-op. The combat has also been retuned to be faster and more fluid, and developer Hexworks promises the game to be an overall expansive action RPG experience. 
We're looking forward to seeing the result of this overhaul when the game comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

PlatinumGames has released the first of a four-part documentary examining the development of Bayonetta 3. It's jam-packed with fascinating anecdotes from the team, including a rather surprising revelation from the game's director, Yusuke Miyata.
Miyata confirmed that Hideki Kamiya, creator of the Bayonetta franchise, approached him directly to offer up the role of the sequel's director. However, instead of jumping at the opportunity, Miyata was initially hesitant and was worried that Kamiya himself would interfere in the project too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego 2K Drive has stirred up a surprising amount of thoughts, perhaps moreso than any other video game so far this year. I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.

In case you missed it, Niantic made another decision that's been unpopular with the Pokemon Go community, which has been a trend since the game came into being. The team is up-charging for remote raids, and will limit the amount of times you can partake in them. It's one of a series of reversals that gave folks hope that Pokemon Go would improve before a core feature was rug-pulled.
That was weeks ago. Speaking to Dot Esports, several team members have finally responded to the backlash. Michael Steranka, Pokemon Go director, started off by saying that they've "taken note" of the backlash and that it's "hard to ignore." Steranka is personally tagged in some of these tweets, and like Destiny developer Bungie often says before they immediately…]]></summary>

This all comes as a part of the Team GO Rocket plan (isn't it always?) to take over all of the gyms across the region. During the upcoming Rising Shadows Event from 22nd May, select gyms will see the villains' Shadow Type Pokémon taking centre stage as Shadow Raid Bosses. As we have come to expect, these will be available to catch if you manage to defeat the boss, so keep an eye out for any 'mon that you have been hunting for a while.

But, as we all know, the best-laid plans of mice and men do not always come to pass — And the interdimensional return of the nefarious sorcerer, Shang Tsung, brings about the chaos of war to this seemingly pleasant, and hugely prosperous new era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shohei Ohtani meets Rockman.
There’s something refreshing about playing a Mega Man-like action platformer in 2023. Instead of expansive open worlds to explore, you get a handful of themed stages to leap through. There’s no deep narrative or lore to invest in, yet the colourful cast of bad guys and allies draws you in all the same with their fun designs. Catchy chiptune scores get stuck in your head instead of epic orchestral arrangements. All of the above is true of Sonzai Game’s sports-themed Bat Boy; if you’ve played an action platformer before, you know what you’re in for, and that ain’t a bad thing.
Bat Boy’s opening cinematic introduces you to Ryosuke and his hero team of eight sporty friends, including his tennis-playing love interest Racket Girl and the macho (American) football player Mr. Blitzer. Inexplicably, a little gremlin man named Lord Vicious and his bodyguard lure the Super Sports Friends into a trap, brainwashing them to join in his games in another dimension. Ryosuke, wielding his trusty bat, manages to swat away the brainwashing magic before it can infect him, so it’s up to him to seek out and beat the possession out of his buddies as the titular Bat Boy, gaining his friends’ abilities along the way that will help him in his quest. Also along for the ride is Garou, a talking crow that doles out information and one-liners.

There's...a lot to parse in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, when it comes to the Ultrahand/creation aspect of the game. Now you can basically ignore it entirely, and just beat the game cleanly, like Breath of the Wild. But if you want, there's a ton of tools at your disposal to craft all sorts of helpful vehicles and contraptions that can nudge you along. Hmm, it sure would be helpful if someone could create a database to track them all: well, Twitter user AKREW Daniel Luu did just that!
The site is called ZeldaBuilds.gg, and allows users to sign up and share their own creations, or peruse others for inspiration. It also has a fantastic "materials" section to help break down all of the game's Zonai Devices, in case you're getting overwhelmed. Not every creation uses every possible part; so it's a great way to take stock. And if you get really into it and want to amass a pile of devices to bust out and start creating stuff at any time, there's a handy list of all of the Zonai dispensers right here. Make sure you do not click the "uses" link unless you want a few boss spoilers though!
Orbital Strike Laser Cannon
u/0KdQ6 in tearsofthekingdom


There are some real gems on there
One of the most impressive builds shared around is the "Satellite Laser Cannon," also called the orbital strike laser cannon in some places, which you can see in action above. The gist is that it literally creates an autonomous robot that flies around and lasers enemies mercilessly, essentially as an additional party member. The creator in question above has a ton of battery power to pull it off, so they earned it!
Other handy creations include skateboards, bikes, a combat buggy, planes, and tanks. Oh, and of course, devices for messing with Koroks.

The powerful warrior-sorcerer, whose aim to bring peace and pleasance to Earth led to globe-shattering events of biblical proportions, will bring his ethereal skills to the battlefield on May 25. A new trailer showcases what appears to be one of the most complex and technical fighters in franchise history, (and with GG, that's really saying something), who is armed with over 20 spells with which to confuse their opponent, control space, defend against attack and, of course, kick a lotta ass.
You can see That Man in action in the preview below. Yikes.

In addition to Asuka R#'s arrival, Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass owners will also receive the new stage Tir Na N0g, as well as two special 25th-anniversary color packs, bringing additional palettes that can be applied to the entire roster of characters. These include a pink-and-white scheme, a neon green-and-white scheme, and finally an orange-and-white scheme. The pink-and-white look will be available to download to all players free of charge.
Finally, Arc System Works confirmed that a third season of content for Guilty Gear Strive is in the works, bringing even more characters, stages, and colors to the hit release. Players can also expect the arrival of the long-long-long awaited update that hopes to bring myriad fixes to the title's frustrating lobby and online issues.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

After Nintendo announced that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sold an astonishing 10 million copies within its first three days of sale, it was clear that we'd start to see more instances of the game reaching incredible milestones in various global regions.
This time it's Japan's turn, and according to Game Data Library over on Twitter, the latest entry to the Zelda franchise now sits comfortably in the top ten biggest game launches of all time in the region. With 2,240,000 launch sales, it comes in 7th place, behind the likes of Final Fantasy VIII, Pokémon Black and White, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, yet ahead of behemoths such as Final Fantasy VII and Monster Hunter: Rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher targeting an unprecedented $8 billion in revenue
Take-Two Interactive, the parent publisher behind Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto franchise, has announced that it is preparing for what it believed will be a record-shattering fiscal year 2025. The comments were made by CEO Strauss Zelnick in the company's newest financial report.
"Fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success," said Zelnick.
"In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering additional growth in our operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond."
Considering the obscene amount of money referenced, as well as the supreme confidence delivered in the statement, one can only assume that the fiscal year 2024, (This period denotes the calendar year running from April 2024 to March 2025), will see the studio launch Grand Theft Auto VI, the latest release in a franchise that leaves almost every other gaming franchise in existence kicking in the dust when in comes to both immediate and long term revenue.
When pressed as to whether this number essentially guaranteed the release window for GTA VI, Zelnick was non-commital, but it seems almost impossible for the "industry standard setting" revenue of $8 billion to be reached without some sort of major, and that's major, release. Grand Theft Auto V, a title that is now a decade old, continues to move copies, and currently sits at the 180 million sales mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New episodes will arrive every other week
Telltale Games is premiering the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series this summer. The first installment will go live on July 27, with more episodes to follow in the weeks after.
The Expanse series will be episodic, with five episodes in total. After the first drops on July 27, each episode will follow two weeks after each other, putting the targeted end date in September.
There's a standard edition for $39.99, or a Deluxe Edition for $44.99 that will give 24-hour early access on PlayStation or Epic, and also future DLC. Yes, Telltale confirms DLC is on the way, though it doesn't clarify what shape that will take.

All part of the churn
This new Expanse series arrives from the revived Telltale Games, under LCG Entertainment. While it's rolled out games like the Shadow Edition of the Batman Telltale series, The Expanse is one the studio has been building up to for a while, in collaboration with Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine.
Telltale also confirmed that The Wolf Among Us 2, its follow-up to the previous Fable adventure, is delayed into 2024. The shift is to avoid crunch, and move from Unreal 4 to 5, according to an IGN interview at the time.
This will be an interesting one to watch, to see what the new Telltale is putting out. Deck Nine's involvement certainly has me intrigued, as True Colors was a really solid entry in the Life is Strange series, and I'm a fan of The Expanse too. Opting for an episodic structure similar to what old Telltale popularized has me curious about its reception, though. At the very least, it will be weeks between episodes rather than months.
We'll see if the sci-fi drama's gradual rollout works. The Expanse: A Telltale Series premieres on July 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Epic.

Mommy’s Best Games has acquired the IPs of “legendary” arcade developer Occidental Design and is wringing them for every last drop of latent cash by releasing the long-lost Bumpy Grumpy on PC.
Occidental Design was the horrifically disfigured lovechild of Baer Sternmidden and William S. Fushnell, who were behind such controversial classics as Rip 'n' Tear, Xordian Knot, and Hellbombers. Bumpy Grumpy had a regional test back in 1983, but never saw the light of day beyond that. Occidental Design then faced bankruptcy multiple times before giving up in the face of horrible poverty in the early ‘90s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After co-creator Ed Boon teased Mortal Kombat 12 news last week, we have confirmation that a formal reveal will happen tomorrow, May 18.
A new tweet from the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account reads, "Tomorrow is a new dawn" and contains a teaser styled after the previous video, featuring a clock hand that skips past 12 and strikes 1, followed by the text “It Is Time” with a start time of 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.

May 17, 2023
Fans have speculated that the clock landing on "1" may signify the next game is a reboot of sorts. Although 2011’s MK 9 already did that, the wild ending of MK 11 (and its Aftermath expansion) certainly paved the runway for Netherrealm to essentially start fresh and do whatever it wants with the fiction going forward. As such, this 12th entry has the potential to be pretty nuts, even by MK standards. 
We learned a new Mortal Kombat was coming this year when Warner Bros. CEO told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was launching this year. Whether this new game is actually called MK 12 or something else entirely is unclear, but we’re looking forward to waking up bright and early tomorrow morning to see what’s next for our favorite spine-ripping kombatants.]]></summary>

Developer Behaviour Interactive released a teaser for an announcement on July 5 regarding the massively talented actor's mysterious involvement. As for what Cage's role entails, an in-game version of the Renfield star only offers this nugget:
“There’s nothing more powerful than imagination. One can shape the fabric of reality, transforming everything you think you may know.”


Who knows what that means, but it looks like Cage is joining the game in some capacity. Is he a killer? Will he appear in one of his many, many film roles? Or is it scary enough to just have Nicolas Cage as himself running around trying to murder players? We’ll get our answers in July.

Acclaimed roguelite Dead Cells is getting set to bring its compelling and amorphous adventure to your local coffee table, courtesy of a brand new board game currently in production at Le Scorpion Masque.
The Montreal-based studio, which has previously produced board games such as Decrypto, Zombie Kidz, and Stay Cool, launched a Kickstarter for Dead Cells, which will be the company's first licensed title. While the crowdfunding kicked off with a modest target of around $30,000 USD, the campaign has, at the writing of writing, surpassed a staggering $250,000, with 15 days still to go. As such, the game will now go into production. A release window is yet to be announced.
https://youtu.be/rfl-gb3M520
The Dead Cells board game will look to retain both the visual aesthetic, immersive atmosphere, and general gameplay of Motion Twin's 2018 release, as 1-4 players pick their way through ever-shifting dungeons in co-operative action, as they battle through High Peak Castle en route to a confrontation with the nefarious Hand of The King. One of four uniquely skilled Beheaded can be chosen, and the board will retain the Die/Repeat nature of its roguelike origins.
You can check out a breakdown of a pre-production copy in the video below, courtesy of the board game fans at Good Time Society.
https://youtu.be/qny-UMI4y1Q
Explore biomes, level up your character, defeat enemies, conquer challenges, and lose it all on the turn of a card. Level up your Beheaded, earn permanent upgrades, and work with your fellow team members to defeat what seems, at first glance, a near-insurmountable challenge. But strategy, synergy, and persistence can pay off in the end, or you'll simply die, and die, and die, and die trying.
You can check out a full breakdown of Dead Cells on the official Kickstarter.
Dead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and iOS/Android platforms.

The September after it first dropped, I took the bus over to the next town and dropped around $150 on the indigo purple version along with copies of The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Super Mario Advance. Five days later, I would return to the store to get a light for the screen because it was dark as hell.
That was a difficult year for me. Having a GBA got me through some very tough times. The toughest of which was my move from Washington to California. A new city. A new school.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That’s a lot of words
Strange Scaffold has announced another title in their stable of upcoming games, Teenage Demon Slayer Society. It’s currently only announced for PC and only has a release window of 2024.
Teenage Demon Slayer Society bills itself as “a bold new turn-based take on character action games, featuring style ranks, customizable movesets, and cool, endearing characters.” Strangely, my brain can make sense of that salad of descriptors, which is sad, because I get confused when paperwork asks for my address.
https://youtu.be/nmm2POiMNXQ
A trailer dropped alongside the announcement, showing off the game's style. I dig it. I like turn-based strategy that involves exactly one character. It’s not really all that much different than moving a bunch of characters around, but it makes me feel cool.
Real demons
Since Strange Scaffold is best known for An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Teenage Demon Slayer Society kind of blows my mind. Those two games employ more of a jank-pop aesthetic, whereas this one looks more like a stylish anime. It makes sense, though, since Japan is the only place where teenagers fight demons anymore. Actual sexy demons, I mean. Not like alcoholism or the imaginary kind that televangelists and Alex Jones shout at you about.
This is also quite the pace that Strange Scaffold has going on. It’s the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., whose work extends to a number of other great games beyond Strange Scaffold and into places like Hypnospace Outlaw. It feels like An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs was released yesterday, but because time has no meaning, it was actually 2021. Still, Teenage Demon Slayer Society joins Sunshine Shuffle and El Paso, Elsewhere in upcoming titles from the developer.
Teenage Demon Slayer Society is Currently only announced for PC. It is targeting a 2024 release.

        <updated>2023-05-17T15:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios has shifted the scope of its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The game was first announced in 2021 as a co-op PvE-focused experience about working together to battle invading alien machines. Now, the game will have a PvP element thrown into the mix.
In an update, Embark reveals that since delaying Arc Raiders to focus on finishing its other upcoming title, The Finals, it’s added competitive play as well as an extraction element. The game still unfolds on a far future Earth ravaged by sentient machines, but now teams must compete with other human players in addition to the in-game enemies. Furthermore, the game adopts extraction-based objectives by tasking players to locate and retrieve resources scattered across the world for their squad. Here’s Embark's pitch for what Arc Raiders now entails:
Embark plans on launching a closed alpha test, giving players who sign up on their website the first opportunity to go hands-on with Arc Raiders. The game still has no release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
What do you think of this new premise for Arc Raiders? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of rupees
It may have just come out on Friday, May 12, 2023, but The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is already selling faster than any other title in the series.
How many? Holy crap, 10 million so far. I come from an era when 1 million was this massive, unattainable milestone that few ever reached. Now games are crossing that mark in a few days. And as the press release points out (via BusinessWire), “with over 4 million sold in the Americas, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game and the fastest-selling Nintendo game for any system in that territory.”
Fun fact, the original Legend of Zelda sold an estimated 6.5 million on NES. Meanwhile, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has sold around 30 million copies. So, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still has some catching up to do, but it’s off to an incredible start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ
Tears of the Kingdom is the perfect storm for sales. Its direct predecessor (ignoring the Link’s Awakening remake) was already well-received and sold like hotcakes. Any game in The Legend of Zelda series is already going to be hotly anticipated, and Tears of the Kingdom was well-received by critics. It was announced back in 2019, and since then has been like a cow being slowly lowered into a tank of piranhas. There’s no surprise that the piranhas are now gorging themselves.
Personally, I’m enjoying it. I’m among the many who loved Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom feels like an extension of that. A lot of puzzle-solving is based around building things, which is a feature that works just fine for me. I don’t spend a lot of time getting overly creative because I prefer to focus on the exploration, but I still enjoy it just fine. I guess I’m just joining the chorus here.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.

A new PlayStation Showcase has been scheduled, and it's airing fairly soon. Sony will host its PlayStation Showcase next week on May 24, with some news to share for both the PlayStation 5 and PS VR2.
The stream will go live at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 24. You can follow it via the PlayStation Twitch or YouTube channels.
PlayStation's show will run for "a bit over an hour," according to the PlayStation Blog shared today, focused on PlayStation 5 and PS VR2 games. It will have "several new creations" from PlayStation Studios, as well as third-party partners and indie creators.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1658834831483060226
What's ahead for PlayStation
While this won't be PlayStation's first stream of 2023, this showcase does have a different air about it. The confirmation of first-party PlayStation Studios news is likely enticing, given that Sony's State of Play streams in 2023 so far have focused more on third-party titles.
It's certainly an opportunity for something like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is expected to arrive this year, to resurface. Several other upcoming games from frequent PlayStation partners could be possible, too. I know I'd be interested in some more details on something like Death Stranding 2.
It also runs just a little bit ahead of June, where the summer of gaming news has slowly but surely congregated. Even without an E3 to bind them all together, streams from companies like Xbox and Ubisoft are still taking place, as well as Summer Game Fest and its kickoff stream.
PlayStation's getting a little ahead of that curve with a May 24 show. We'll see what Sony has in store for its first-party production at the PlayStation Showcase on May 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A PlayStation Showcase will air next week, ostensibly serving as the publisher’s big summer showcase.
It airs on Wednesday, May 24, at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern. A PlayStation Blog post states the event will run a little over an hour and will feature new titles for PS5 and PS VR2. In addition to showcasing first-party PlayStation Studios titles, the event will also highlight third-party and indie games. 
This means it's time to put on our speculation hats. It’s likely we’ll see Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at the show given it’s releasing this fall and we’ve yet to see gameplay of it. There’s also the slim chance that Wolverine could make an appearance. Naughty Dog could also provide an update on its The Last of Us multiplayer title. Personally, we’re hoping to see something about that mysterious adventure title from a recent PlayStation ad that has rumored ties to Uncharted. As for third-party, it would be nice to see more of the PS5-exclusive Silent Hill 2 remake. 
So what do you expect/hope to see at Sony’s big event? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

In addition to garnering an overwhelmingly positive critical reception, over 10 million copies of the hotly anticipated sequel have already been sold within its first three days of release.
That number makes Tears of the Kingdom the fastest-selling entry in franchise history. A press release states that 4 million of those sales have been in the Americas, which not only makes it the fastest-selling Switch game in this territory but the fastest-selling Nintendo game period. This achievement is even more impressive when you consider that Tears of the Kingdom is also the first $70 Nintendo first-party title, showing fans are willing to shell out the extra dough for a tentpole Switch release.

Sega has announced that it might be next in line to move the price-point of its major releases up to $70, following in the footsteps of all other games publishers who have decided making money isn't worth it if you aren't making all the money.
The considerations were noted during a Q&A conference held following the publishing of Sega's latest financial report. Sega Sammy CEO Haruki Satomi and CFO Koichi Fukazawa were asked if the studio planned to follow the lead of publishers such as Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros. Interactive.
"In the global marketplace, AAA game titles for consoles have been sold at $59.99 for many years, but titles sold at $69.99 have appeared in the last year," noted the duo, in a translation of the meeting…]]></summary>

Last night, the Overwatch 2 development team announced that they've scrapped most of their ideas including the Hero Missions mode which had skill trees, levelling up, and other light RPG elements shown off in the trailer below. Instead, they'll be gradually releasing co-op story missions and integrating them into their ongoing seasons, similar to how PvE operated in the first Overwatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Ghost
Nintendo has announced that it will be delisting Bandai Namco's fun Paccle Royale, (no, it doesn't work, does it?), title Pac-Man 99 this fall. Currently available from the Nintendo eShop as a benefit to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, the game will be unable to download from October 8.
Players who own either paid edition of the game — Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock — will still be able to access CPU Battle, Time Attack, and Blind Score Attack in an offline capacity. Additionally, all purchased themes and cosmetic items will still be available. All online services for the title are to be suspended, however, which is pretty frustrating given that this is the foundation of the Pac-Man 99 gimmick.
No reason was given for the decision because Nintendo gon' Nintendo, but the title hasn't seen quite the same level of success as its sibling, Tetris 99, which launched back in the fall of 2019. There could also be an expiring license issue, given the pill-popper's torrid legacy with red tape. Or, Nintendo could simply be doing it because why not? It be that way sometimes.
Pac-Man 99 is available now on Nintendo Switch, players wishing to enjoy the offline modes after delisting will need to pick up the Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock.

Stranger of Paradise was a very different lens into the world of Final Fantasy than we're accustomed to. Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo partnered with Square Enix to reimagine the story of the first Final Fantasy, creating a lovably irreverent protagonist with Jack Garland in the process.
It was, by all accounts, a solid vision of an action-driven, alternative take on Final Fantasy's origins. The team continued to build on it over time, with more downloadable content and jobs, adding some classic pieces of Final Fantasy mythos in the process.
With the recent release of the Steam version, we got a chance to catch up with director Daisuke Inoue and ask some burning lingering questions about Stranger of Paradise, now a little over a year since its launch. We've previously tal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In California, Sizzle Season is more commonly known as "The State is on Fire" Season
I'm not sure what happened between me and Splatoon, but spare time to play the game seemed to evaporate for me once the series made the move to Nintendo Switch. I still adore everything about this series. I just have a tough time making space in my schedule for it. Hopefully, I can find a way to turn that around with the start of Sizzle Season. This morning, Nintendo dropped a fresh trailer for the game detailing everything players will experience in the new season, including a new gun modeled after the Super Scope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mLdx4sVKw
Something tells me that Super Scope will get a lot more play than the actual one. As you saw in the trailer, a fan-style paintbrush is also being added to Splatoon 3 with the Sizzle Season as well as the wonderfully named Barnacle & Dime stage, rendered as one incredibly opulent mall. Kudos to the translators who decided the best way to connect with the kids today is to name the stage after a line of stores that haven't been relevant for 30 years.
In addition to the new stage and weapons, the Sizzle Season will also introduce Jammin' Salmon Junction for Salmon Run, new clothes, new cards, and new challenges like Too Many Trizookas.
That sounds like a pretty solid season if you ask me. While I still need to play through the story of Splatoon 2, I should probably dedicate at least some of my time each week to the multiplayer of Splatoon 3. If only so I don't miss out on some sick-as-hell threads.
Sizzle Season starts in Splatoon 3 on June 1, 2023.

Blizzard is changing its plans for the long-awaited Overwatch 2 PvE mode. In a developer update today, the company confirms that it's scrapping its original plans for the mode, pivoting its PvE side into the seasonal content structure of the game.
Back in 2019, Blizzard Entertainment officially unveiled Overwatch 2, a follow-up to its 2016 hero shooter. Alongside updates to the PvP multiplayer side, there was a PvE mode shown off. Players would choose a hero, squad up, and tackle missions where they could level up talents and maintain some level of long-term progress.
This mode felt like a big reason for the "2" in Overwatch 2, but it eventually fell by the wayside. Overwatch 2 launched last year without its new PvE mode, and the q…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.
Season 5, which has the theme of "Mischief and Magic," is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.
Season 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.
Finally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.
Overwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.]]></summary>

Xbox appears to be sitting pretty in the UK, at least according to new data released by the chart-building analyst Gfk, which notes that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S platforms have now surpassed two million sales within Blighty's borders.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the two million milestone was achieved in 128 weeks from launch, which makes the Gen9 platform the eighth fastest-selling console in UK history. Surprisingly, (or perhaps not, depending on your perspective), Xbox hit this mark even faster than the Nintendo Switch, which took 140 weeks to shift two million units to British customers.
The cozy black box did not, however, beat the precedent set by Microsoft's own Xbox One, which sold the same amount of units in just 104 weeks. Of course, the Xbox One launch did not have to face the same obstacles presented to the Xbox Series X/S launch, including COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages. For the sake of interest, the console that reached two million UK sales in the quickest time is, of course, Nintendo Wii, which reached the target in a mere 57 weeks during 2006-2007.
The remainder of the Top Five is rounded out with PlayStation hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EVGA's Kingpin motherboards are some of the most bonkers out there, proper slabs that are designed for extreme overclocking with hugely impressive power delivery, multiple BIOSes and some unique features. They're also hugely expensive, normally costing close to $1000, but a deep discount on their Z690 model over at Newegg brings it to $400. That's still pricey, but a reasonable pickup given the feature list for anyone designing a top-end gaming rig around Intel's 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write about Veiled Experts for over a month now, since playing it religiously during the Final Beta Test. I've been putting it off mostly because I've been busy, but also because I'm trying to find a way of saying "actually it's really good" without people laughing and throwing garbage at me. It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said "third person Counter-Strike", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: "sounds awful".
Thank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a bunch of the demos at LudoNarraCon earlier this month, the best one I played, with zero hesitation, was Cryptmaster. Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.
Developed by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.

Music is a definitely big part of these games, but Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical has set itself on a different kind of musical path, in that it’s actually a musical. I'm talking like a full-on ballad-belter, curtain-caller, exit-stage-left-er musical. And get this: it’s also a modern retelling of the mythos behind the Greek Gods. It feels like my inner theatre kid has chugged ten Red Bulls and is waiting for her cue to burst out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five years after competitive multiplayer mech shooter Hawken shut down, a new game will invite us back to stomp around in its scrappy mechs. Announced last night by developers and publishers 505 Games, the free-to-play Hawken Reborn will launch into early access tomorrow. This time, it's a PvE game, with story missions plus open patrol zones to explore and complete jobs. I was enamoured with the jetdashing scrappy mechs and greeble-covered apartment blocks of the first game but always wished it had a singleplayer or co-op campaign, so I'm certainly curious about this.

Roughly summarized, here are the conclusions the European Commission came to as a result of their investigations:

Playing god is a familiar feeling for many video game genres, like action titles where your character is unstoppable or sims where you control everything. Roleplaying a god is rarely something I feel while playing puzzle games, but Humanity provides it in new and surprising ways. The unique style of puzzle solving uses directional signs and commands to guide droves of miniature people to an endpoint. The puzzles start simple, but Humanity builds on this core system throughout its 100-plus stages in exciting and challenging ways, push…]]></summary>

There are some buck wild concepts in Square Enix’s game, including fourth wall breaks to manipulate characters' actions and literally muting someone by turning voices off in the options menu, to name just two of the wackier features (and a big plot twist is discussed in this article, so beware if you're planning on playing Paranormasight soon). 


At the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.

The newest, last week’s Patch 4, sounded particularly enthusiastic about tackling Jedi: Survivor’s technical troubles, so now would be a fine time to check in on the progress of this fixing-upping campaign.


A few droid decapitatin’ benchmark runs later, I can say that Patch 4 (and its predecessors) have made meaningful improvements to ray tracing performance, and that there's a lot less stuttering than there was at launch - even if this hasn’t been smoothed out entirely. General performance, however, remains deeply underwhelming, with powerful GPUs still unable to achieve a bulletproof 60fps even at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.
Patricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.
Patricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.
If you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.
Those numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.
In the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.
Running out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.
For more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, and this feature of stupid screenshots.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.
Once Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can "make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule."
Ranked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.
Ranked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and "other factors" Epic has yet to specify.
Will you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Green New Deal Simulator begins with a talking owl. This owl can’t sleep at night, mainly because it’s nocturnal, but also because the planet’s impending environmental doom has affected their shoddy sleep schedule. That’s where the Green New Deal Simulator comes in, a micro deck-builder about transitioning the USA into a post-carbon economy, all while keeping employment rates stable. The results are simultaneously funny, educational, intense, and they help that damn owl get a good night's rest.

        <updated>2023-05-15T14:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. 
Mouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.
The game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. 


Mouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

There are some exceptions to the rule, but we reckon they're justified because some worlds are too special to discount.

The game is a prehistoric take on Stardew Valley’s crop-growing, dungeon-exploring, people-romancing formula. Its PAX East demo caught our eye earlier this year, and the full release late last month charmed many fans on Steam for the short time it was available.

Last month a single YouTube-ripping domain received a staggering 343 million visits and is still trending upwards, so who gets the blame?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samsung's 870 Qvo SSD is one of the best options for high-capacity solid state storage, with a simple 2.5-inch form factor that doesn't take up a valuable M.2 or PCIe slot and a fast-enough SATA connection. While performance is good, at up to 550MB/s for reads and a little less for writes, the real benefit here is having up to 8TB of silent, reliable and low latency storage. 
You can currently pick up this RPS-recommended gaming SSD in its ultimate 8TB form for less than £415 from two places in the UK: Tech Next Day, where you can use code TND-10 to get it for £414, and Amazon, where you can get the drive for £412. I've included both options in case you have a preference, and in the event the drive goes out of stock at this reduced price by the time you come to click the links below! 
Tech Next Day - Get the Samsung 870 Qvo 8TB for £414 w/ code TND-10 (RRP £452)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's RX 6950 XT has been enjoying a surprising revival as of late, as precipitous price drops have positioned it as a cheaper competitor to Nvidia's new RTX 4070 GPU that offers better performance in rasterised titles - by a significant ~20% margin, too. 


Today, the RX 6950 XT has dropped below the £600 mark for the first time we're aware of, with a chunky triple-fan ASRock model costing just £598 at Overclockers in the UK. That's significantly cheaper than the £999 that these cards originally debuted at, bringing it into contention with newer-gen cards.

You can really imagine Link reaching into a grocery store freezer to grab his favorite obscure ice cream flavor hidden behind all the unsold cartons of strawberry. But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?
Sometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears. I think the flames licking Link's dead body would look great in translucent red plastic.

Artsy games making a point (that seldom grab me, I shouldn't admit) are another. But Mech Punk is something else altogether, and an incredibly rare game that actually earns the "punk" in its title.
Does that mean it's good? Well, umm. Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to "Alan Smithee". I don’t think they’re disowning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. 
But speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games "weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in," he says.

But while we may never get to play a mainline Zelda game on PC, there's no denying it's inspired countless other developers to have a stab at it themselves, hence why we've put together this list of the best PC games like Zelda you can play right now. Whether you're looking to scratch that Tears Of The Kingdom itch or get stuck into something more retro-facing like A Link To The Past, we've got you covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early access shooter Hrot channels the wicked energy of Quake and Dusk with a booming shotgun, fast movement, and wobbly weapon models. Old-school inspirations covered in a Soviet coat of paint that’s so oppressive, it borders on horror. Two of Hrot’s episodes are out now, but the shooter is leaving early access with a third on May 16th and it’s one to watch.

The Remix edition comes in a nifty green colour scheme, is made from recycled materials and is bundled with a free Microsoft  Play & Charge kit, allowing you to replace the battery with a rechargeable Li-Ion alternative - significantly better for the environment than throwing away non-rechargeable batteries, as long as your home's energy comes from somewhat green sources.

The long-awaited sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally here, with reviews confirming that it was well worth the hype (you can read our full review here). The entry innovates and expands upon the formula established by Breath of the Wild in myriad ways, giving players the most open-ended Zelda game yet. 
With the launch finally here, we sat down with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to talk about the daunting task of following Breath of the Wild, as well as the new game's successes and challenges.

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.
It's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after.

But why spend money on a new game when you have perfectly good versions of the same experience broken up across multiple completely different games right now? That’s right, you can enjoy all of Tears of the Kingdom’s signature mechanics – Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall – without dropping $70 bucks (or its future sale price of $68.75). All you have to do is dig up a few games, kick your imagination into overdrive, and ignore everyone talking about how great Zelda is to enjoy an approximation of the Link’s latest adventure.

This is only the third year that games have been recognized at the annual film festival. The event highlights upcoming titles, which have generally been smaller budget/indie works, that have “potential for excellence in art and storytelling through design, artistic mastery, and highly immersive worlds.” The previous Tribeca Games Award winners are Norco in 2021 and Thirsty Suitors in 2022. 
Here is the 2023 selection, which will be spotlighted with new trailers and developer interviews on the big night:
Chants of Sennaar
Despelote
The Expanse: A Telltale Series
Goodbye Volcano High
A Highland Song
Nightscape
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical
Additionally, the festival will screen a new documentary called Hideo Kojima - Connecting Worlds. The film delves into the mind and creative process of the man behind Metal Gear and Death Stranding and features appearances from Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus, Grimes, Chvrches, and others. 
The Tribeca Film Festival runs from June 7-18, but the Games showcase airs on June 9. The Tribeca Game Awards is just one of the many video game showcases airing in June, and you can keep up with all of them by visiting our handy event schedule.]]></summary>

It's why I love the model of Imperialism, where everywhere is one turn, no shuffling away. It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics. But after finally making time for it, I've realised that most of them, even some of the "logi" focused players, don't know what that actually means.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is battling impossible expectations. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild represented a radical and successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda – a series considered by many to be the apex of game design. Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.
To give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect. The resulting game lacks the admittedly difficult-to-recreate, undeniable impact and newness …]]></summary>

Discovery casually name-dropped Mortal Kombat 12 earlier in the year, when an earnings call revealed the fighter was “set to release this year, with ambitious launch projections.” The relaxed announcement wasn’t followed by any flashy marketing (outside of a few funny Ed Boon tweets) until now. Developer Netherrealm have been dropping small teasers that potentially point toward a series reboot, or a timeline cleanse, or a return to the series' past. Hey, the next instalment might not even be named MK12. Watch last night’s very brief teaser below:

I’ve had a blast beating up supernatural weirdos with a group of misfit college teens. Together with its soundtrack of absolute bangers that combines dramatic church choir chorus with pulsing synth wave beats (please put the OST on Spotify, Ysbryd), and a slick art style that makes me dribble like a brain-hungry zombie every time I see it, I’m thinking that Demonschool might very well be on its way to being be one of my favourite games of 2023 when it releases sometime this year. What can I say? I love punching freaky demons in the face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

The story follows Mimi, a young woman who returns to her departed grandmother’s countryside cottage in the real-life French region of Dordogne to uncover family secrets. Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion.

Meanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.

The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games.

In a criminal proceeding, a 25-year-old man was found guilty of selling pirated textbook PDFs to 12 people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

Oh no. The listing includes several examples of post-coital pillow talk, and they are about sexy as you would expect from the studio whose dialogue is best known for inadvertently spawning memes about mudcrabs and knee injuries.

The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next." 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West reviews. Then read what we thought of Horizon Call of the Mountain and the recent Burning Shores expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.
Just like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, "hella broken," and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>

Uplifting news, it is not: the  "network security incident" was a large-scale case of digital thievery, with the culprits stealing a database containing the names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers of customers to WD's online store.


The plundered database also included encrypted and salted passwords and partial credit card numbers, according to the statement. Western Digital are contacting affected users directly, and have temporarily shut down their store.

Redfall is my biggest disappointment of 2023. As a massive fan of developer Arkane Studios’ previous work, from Dishonored through Deathloop, my expectations were high for the company’s new release. However, this vampire-hunting first-person shooter is messy, plagued with technical flaws and head-scratching design decisions counterintuitive to the game itself. The result is an often-bland experience, made frustrating by occasional glimpses of potential, and it’s sucked the life out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, fans will finally get their first look at Payday 3's gamplay, according to a new teaser trailer.
This teaser is the latest following a similarly brief trailer released in January. Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.


Payday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.

Darkest Dungeon II is cruel. A simple miscalculation or bad luck can ruin your two-to-three-hour expedition before the chapter’s final boss. There are no checkpoints; if your party dies, it’s time to start fresh from the very beginning. Only some unlocked upgrades stay with you. When you have to make tough choices all the time while keeping in mind various systems, this can (and will) be frustrating and nerve-racking. At the same time, Darkest Dungeon II is the most cathartic and rewarding experience since the original in 2016.
Much like its predecessor, you create a party of four distinct heroe…]]></summary>

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.
For more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall has been a letdown for many players, but perhaps no one is more disappointed than Xbox head Phil Spencer. During an appearance this morning on Kinda Funny Games’ Xcast, the executive opened up about Redfall’s launch woes.   
“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is not a good game. I don’t think you need me to pour salt on that wound if you’ve spent significant time with it. But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet of Lana, the narrative sci-fi puzzle platformer with Studio Ghibli vibes, got a surprise release date today, and it’s just a couple of weeks away. 
On May 23, players can embark on an adventure as Lana, joined by her cat-like companion, Mui, to rescue her sister. The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below. 


Planet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay. The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you're looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn't say exactly when. 


In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Marvel's Spider-Man and then read our thoughts on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

And then, strangely enough, the voice actor behind the game's Venom hinted on Twitter that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be released this September. While we still don't have official confirmation of when we'll be playing this game, we do know when we'll get our next taste of Insomniac Games' Spider-Man world: this weekend. 
That's because on Free Comic Book day, which is this Saturday on May 6, PlayStation will release a prequel comic book for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 
"When we initially sat down with the team at Marvel, we explored a few different ideas about what kinds of stories we could tell in a prequel comic," Insomniac Games narrative director Jon Paquette writes in a PlayStation Blo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Earlier this year, the company showcased various games, including Redfall and the shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush, at an Xbox and Bethesda Direct in January.
