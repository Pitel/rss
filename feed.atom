They describe the country as a hotbed for online piracy services which are also exported to Europe and the US. Due to lacking copyright laws and systematic corruption, external pressure is needed, they argue.

This review originally went live in 2015, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the arrival of EarthBound Beginnings in the Nintendo Switch Online NES library.

If you were an early adopter of EarthBound fanaticism in the West, you likely caught wind of a previous title made for the Famicom. Translated into English and perfectly playable, it oddly never made it to retail release on the NES. And yet, like from some urban legend, a group of fans managed to buy a beta cartridge of the RPG off eBay in 1998 and released the ROM onto the Internet as "EarthBound Zero."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta rank ‘em all.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus raises a lot of questions about the future of the official competitive Pokémon format, VGC. Will Frostbite replace the Frozen status condition? Will Drowsy supersede Sleep? How will overpowered new moves such as Stone Axe and Victory Dance translate into a ‘typical’ Pokémon game? Will there even be a typical Pokémon game again? Until Game Freak lets us know otherwise, we can only speculate.
However, there are questions we do have the answers to – or at least very educated guesses – such as whether or not the fully evolved seven new Pokémon and the ten new Hisui forms will be viable in VGC.

Not content with finally getting seminal Build engine classic Blood back on digital storefronts (Switch port, please!), as well as the first two Turoks, Doom 64, Quake and Shadow Man, Nightdive Studios have finally got Ancient Egyptian FPS Powerslave (known in the UK as Exhumed) out of its sarcophagus and re-released it as the perfectly-named Powerslave Exhumed, finally giving modern gamers a chance to enjoy this tremendous little gem of a game.
Unusually, this is one boomer shooter from that’s best-known for its home console editions rather than the almost entirely different PC title. Home computer folks had to put up with a much less interesting, far more linear take on the game. Annoyingly, though, while both the Saturn (1996) and PlayStation (1997) versions offered a far superior title, they each had something to offer in their varying level designs. Brilliantly, then, Nightdive have combined the stage layouts of both games in order to separate the wheat from the chaff and deliver the best possible version of the game.

If you're into modern games with retro style, you've got no shortage of options on Switch. For years now talented younger developers have been channelling nostalgia and affection for the games of their youth into new titles that update classic mechanics and genres with mod-cons and 21st century flair. Games like Shovel Knight might feel like you could have been playing them in the '80s, but there are typically myriad little enhancements and features included that are only possible thanks to modern tech, however brilliantly authentic the game looks and feels.
The very latest game to scratch that delicious retro itch is Infernax from Berzerk Studio, a challenging 2D Metroidvania-style adventure which nods towards such classic NES titles as Zelda II, Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania — quite the touchstones! Having thoroughly enjoyed Berzerk's glorious Just Shapes & Beats, we were eager to see how the developer fared in this very different genre.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline entries in Naughty Dog's blockbuster action series, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  
Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console. Released on November 19, 2007, Uncharted brought Naughty Dog into a bold new era of "mature" game development. In this week's episode, we talk about Naughty Dog's history developing titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, how the studio was largely unprepared for the challenges of Uncharted's development. We also talk about how Naughty Dog almost designed a game similar to BioShock, how Johnny Knoxville served as inspiration for Nathan Drake, and how Gears of War's release changed Uncharted's design for the better. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and ex-Game Informer editor and host of the CrossFade podcast Matt Helgeson (@MattHelgeson) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's video game debut.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Perhaps one of the most exciting announcements during this week's Nintendo Direct was Portal: Companion Collection - a two-in-one package containing the first and second game. It marks the first time Valve has ever released its games on a Nintendo platform and it's got the Portal community rather excited.
Portal subreddit user 'cmon1090' took this as an opportunity to share their photoshop concept of a Portal-themed Nintendo Switch - featuring a matching dock and Joy-Con. As you can see, there are all sorts of neat references to the games, including the joysticks as portals:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Packed with potential — and not much else.
It takes mere moments to notice that GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon, the welcome revival of Konami's Famicom-exclusive action/RPG hybrid GetsuFumaDen, is the once-respected publisher's uncomfortably close take on Dead Cells' excellent 'action roguelite' gameplay.
There's the opening room containing a visual record of every weapon unlocked so far. There's the sub-weapon cooldown counter. There's the choice of portals leading to the next randomly generated landscape. There's the limited health potions, the special weapon attributes, the mixture of permanent and run-exclusive upgrades for everything ensuring every attempt is just that little bit easier than the last, the towering bosses, the damaging double-jump stomp… You can find the much loved older title's DNA in every aspect of Undying Moon's gameplay. It's an understandable but unwise move that sadly doesn't completely work in this new release's favour, every newly introduced mechanic and item pick-up only inviting comparison with a more fully featured and original alternative.

Ah nostalgia - it's a tricksy thing. How many times have we gone back to revisit a treasured classic only to find that modern games have spoiled it for us? For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we're used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough. Was this slowdown always here? I don't remember it looking this fuzzy. You mean I have to start again... at the beginning?!

Traditionally MMOs are best played on mouse and keyboard, but Lost Ark isn’t a traditional game, is it? Before I get carried away, know you’ll probably have a better experience playing this isometric action RPG with classic inputs. However, Lost Ark is playable with a controller, if not entirely enjoyable. I’d even argue combat feels best on a controller, despite the general awkwardness of navigating menus, inventories, and action bars on a gamepad.
Regardless of how you’re playing Lost Ark, tedium will soon set in if you don’t learn its many hotkeys and controller shortcuts. With convenience in mind, I …]]></summary>

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion of 2022 is finally ready to launch, and as such, we're here to crack open a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. The expansion includes more 170 cards, including 4 Pokémon VStar cards, 20 Pokémon V, and 3 Pokémon VMax cards. In addition, Brilliant Stars features 30 Trainer Gallery cards with special art, more than 20 Trainer cards, and a new Special Energy card.
We were sent a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. When I opened up all the packs and sorted through my pulls, I was pleased with the generational spread. While Kanto and Galar Pokémon continue to be well-represented, I noticed more Sinnoh monsters this time around. With Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl hitting just last year, and Legends: Arceus launching last month, this feels like a smart move.
My favorite cards this time around happen to fall into the Gen I category. While it's true I hold Gen I in the highest regard (thanks mostly to nostalgia), I like to think that these cards are my favorites not because of that nostalgia, but instead due to the classic-facing designs of these full-art cards. The clean art of the Pikachu V and Raichu V cards immediately caught my eye, and I always consider it a great day when I can pull a Charizard. Of course, having just put a ton of hours into Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it was cool to also pull the titular Pocket Monster from these packs. I also really like some of the Trainer cards included in this expansion, which is not something I can say about every set.
You can see the more than 20 cards I deemed my favorites in the gallery below.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the arrival of Earthbound in the Nintendo Switch Online Super NES library. Fuzzy pickles!

Back in 1995, this second instalment of Shigesato Itoi's much-loved Mother series (as it's known in Japan) only received a western release in North America, where it sold poorly. Buying a second-hand SNES copy for silly money was most people's only option until the Wii U came to the rescue, providing a full worldwide Virtual Console release in 2013 that made it easily available to all. This was followed by a release on New 3DS and inclusion on the Super NES Classic Mini. Wherever you play it, this game is still absolutely worthy of your time, and then some.

Since it was released last June, Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny has been available exclusively on Switch in the US despite it also launching on PlayStation 4 in Japan. Sony and PC fans waiting patiently to play the quirky strategy game only have hold out for a few more months now that NIS America has confirmed the game is heading to PlayStation consoles and PC this summer. 
This new edition of the game, called Disgaea 6 Complete, will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4. It includes every DLC character and cosmetic that was released as part of the game’s season pass. Those additions include familiar faces such as: 
Girl Laharl from Disgaea 1
Adell and Rozalin from Disgaea 2
Mao and Raspberyl from Disgaea 3
Valvatorez, Desco, and Fuka from Disgaea 4
Killia and Usalia from Disgaea 5

Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny is the first game in the series to adopt a 3D polygonal art style, moving away from its traditional sprites. The game stars Zed, a zombie with the ability to repeatedly resurrect himself, and become stronger, as a result, thanks to the game’s new Super Reincarnation system. He and his friends are the only things that can stop a dangerous God of Destruction. 
There’s no exact release date for the Disgaea 6 Complete, but NIS America hopefully divulges that info sooner than later.]]></summary>

Lost Ark has been making plenty of waves this week as it debuted in western countries for the first time. Although the MMORPG is free-to-play, the first few days of access have only been available for those who purchased a Founder's Pack. Despite that minor and temporary price gating, Lost Ark has been pulling some impressive numbers with over 500,000 concurrent players in the first two days. The popularity of the title has led to some adjustments to where new players can create characters and the opening of new servers to accommodate the audience starting to play this week.

Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

Horizon Forbidden West hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18 and it seems players are excited to return to Aloy’s journey because its predecessor, Horizon Zero Dawn, just surpassed a new milestone: 20 million copies sold. 
It’s no surprise – Zero Dawn is one of PlayStation’s best-selling games and it makes sense that more people picked it up in the run-up to Forbidden West. What better way to catch up on the story of Aloy’s first journey in the original 2017 game? Still though, 20 million is a massive number. 
Wow, Horizon Zero Dawn has officially sold over 20 MILLION copies around the world across PS4 and PC! What an incredible achievement @Guerrilla, and a big thank you to our hugely supportive fans!

“Wow, Horizon Zero Dawn has officially sold over 20 million copies around the world across PS4 and PC,” PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst wrote on Twitter today. “What an incredible achievement [Guerrilla Games], and a big thank you to our hugely supportive fans. Now, let’s get ready to visit Horizon Forbidden West in a week.” 
On top of that, Hulst also revealed that more than 1 billion hours of Horizon Zero Dawn has been played. That’s a lot of destroyed machines. 
As Hulst notes, Forbidden West hits PlayStation next week, on February 18, and while waiting for that day, catch up on all of Game Informer’s Horizon Forbidden West coverage. Check out the latest trailer that showcases challenges, arenas, and salvage contracts and then watch his “Meet the Cast” trailer. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Horizon Forbidden West after that.

The NPD data is emerging for January, giving us a good idea of the winners and losers in the US market at the start of the year.
For Nintendo it's a mixed set of results; to get the negative out of the way the Switch fell out of top spot in hardware sales. On the metrics of units sold and revenue the PlayStation 5 came out on top, with Xbox Series X|S in second. One factor may be that both companies were able to boost supply a little, and it also seems like Nintendo's impressive sales over the Holidays may have constrained supplies. The NPD Group's Mat Piscatella highlighted on social media that the hardware winner each month typically matches stock availability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

Marty O’Donnell and Mike Salvatori are also exploring the option of securing an injunction on Paramount’s upcoming Halo TV series. If such an injunction is secured, it could delay the show’s release. 
According to Eurogamer’s report, the lawyers representing O’Donnell and Salvatori filed the lawsuit in a Washington court back in June of 2020 and that since then, depositions and discoveries have been made. Now, a medi…]]></summary>

Ubisoft’s upcoming Dawn of Ragnarok expansion for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is right around the corner – it hits the game on March 10 – and just one day after Game Informer’s preview of it went live, the company has released a new six-minute overview trailer that showcases what to expect. 
In Dawn of Ragnarok, players will control Eivor, under the guise of Odin, in the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim, which has been invaded. It picks up after the conclusion of the Norse realm story seen in the base Assassin’s Creed Valhalla game and while players are encouraged to reach a power level of 340, if you just want to jump right into the action, a power level boost awaits you at the start. And you’ll need it too if you want to survive battles through magma-infused Muspels and the icy realm of Jotnar while Odin seeks to defeat the fire giant Surtr and save Baldr. 
You’ll learn about all that and more in Ubisoft’s latest Dawn of Ragnarok overview trailer, which you can watch below:

As you can see in the trailer above, it goes over basically everything you can expect in this expansion – powers, equipment and gear, the story, trials and challenges, puzzles, how it affects Eivor, and more. 
If you’re looking for even more information about the game, be sure to read Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok preview and then check out our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla review.

Since retro games became, well, retro, many studios making games today have attempted to emulate the music, art, style, and feel of classics like Castlevania, Super Metroid, and others. Nostalgia for games like that helps them a lot in many cases, but that only gets you so far – at the end of the day, you do actually need to create a great game when attempting to dig back into the treasure chest that is 8-bit and 16-bit action-adventure gameplay. I'm happy to report that Berzerk Studio's Infernax, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on February 14, has been a blast so far. 
While I've not completed the game just yet, there's plenty within that I want to keep a secret for yourself to view in the full game. However, if you've not heard of Infernax or are looking for more information about it, we have you covered with the first 15 minutes of the game (and if you're anything like me, these first 15 minutes will sell you on the game quite well). 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Ben Reeves, and Marcus Stewart talk and walk you through the first 15 minutes of Infernax. Is it hitting the highs of the games it's inspired by? Find out in this special preview video. Thanks for watching and be sure to let us know what you think of Infernax.]]></summary>

It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

With so many amazing indie titles released last year, you’d think it would be tough for 2022 to measure up. But somehow, this year is just as ridiculously stuffed with awesome-looking experiences. Independent creators are bringing their triple-I-games with titles that range from an action-packed Kung Fu epic to an unsettlingly cute community builder. Presented in chronological release order, here’s our list of the indie games we are most looking forward to in 2022.

Lost Ark launches for Western audiences this week, with its three-day early access event starting today. Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate's RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I've had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I'm not comfortable drop…]]></summary>

PlayStation's Twitter is having a whole morning of indie announcements, and Devoured Studios' newest game Salt and Sacrifice joined the party with a PS Blog post about its PvP and a sneaky announcement of its release date on May 10. 
Like its predecessor and From Software's Souls games it's heavily inspired by, Salt and Sacrifice will give players the option to invade others' worlds and impede their progress through PvP battles. As an Inquisitor, your charge is to rid the world of mages who have succumbed to and have become agents of chaos. Depending on the factions you'll choose throughout the adventure, …]]></summary>

Sometimes, a Magic: The Gathering set comes along that breaks multiple boundaries you thought would never be considered, or at least not for a while longer. Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty is one of those sets. Not only did Wizards of the Coast bring us back to this often maligned, yet fan-favorite plane based on Japanese mythology, but we're seeing it 1200 years in the future from when we last stepped foot on Kamigawa. For the first time ever, Magic has gone high-tech with this new take on Kamigawa introducing plenty of neon lights, mechs, and transforming equipment to join the familiar sights …]]></summary>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is among the most exciting releases for nostalgic fans of beat 'em ups. We still don’t have a release date for the arcade-inspired brawler, we now know that the Turtles’ wise teacher, Master Splinter, is joining the fray. We also have confirmation that the game is heading to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside Switch and PC. 
Splinter kicks all kinds of tail in his trailer, including bashing foes with his staff and executing a Street Fighter-style hurricane kick of all things. Splinter is the second non-Turtle playable character alongside April O’Neil. Could Casey Jones be next? Miyamoto Usagi? We’ll have to wait and see.

Shredder's Revenge is an original adventure inspired by classics such as Turtles in Time. It supports four-player co-op (local and online) as the Turtles beat the snot out of Foot Clan and goons like Bebop and Rocksteady. To learn more about how Shedder's Revenge came to life, check out our extended preview and interview with developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu.]]></summary>

As you all know, Tom Holland truly manifested his rise to prominence. A decade ago, the young movie star voiced his interest in donning the iconic Spider-Man spandex, and now he's a beloved household name in the MCU. Holland is also slated to portray Nathan Drake in the upcoming Uncharted movie. However, his latest dream project – a Jak and Daxter film adaptation – might not be a mere delusion of grandeur. Uncharted director, Ruben Fleischer, is set to make a Jak and Daxter movie next.

BAFTA Award-winning co-op adventure Never Alone is finally making its way to Switch later this month. 
More specifically, E-Line Media revealed in a new launch trailer for the Switch version of this heartwarming game that it will hit the handheld-hybrid home console on February 24. That same trailer also has a tease for Never Alone 2 in it, so it's never been a better time to run through the original game.

You'll be able to play through both Never Alone and its Foxtales DLC when the Never Alone: Arctic Collection hits Switch on February 24. As noted in the trailer, E-Line Media has teased a sequel with news that Never Alone 2 is now in pre-production.

As such, this article is going to contain big honking spoilers for some of the more unbelievable bits of the AC: Valhalla story (which is most of it, tbh), because I really won't be able to set up talking about the Dawn Of Ragnarok preview presentation I attended the other week without mentioning those spoilers. All right? All right.

We got the first few details of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok a couple of months ago alongside news of the game’s Odyssey crossover. The sprawling, 35-hour long expansion follows Eivor, in the guise of Odin, through the dwarven realm Svartalfheim, which has recently been invaded. Battling through the magma-infused Muspels and ice-encrusted Jotnar, Odin seeks to defeat the fire giant Surtr to save the kidnapped god Baldr.

Klonoa is an often-overlooked but beloved platformer from yesteryear, but it's getting another chance in the limelight with Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series. This new collection was revealed during yesterday's Nintendo Direct and bundles remastered versions of the first two games, Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil, for a contemporary release on Switch and other platforms. 
If you missed out on Klonoa, they're sidescrolling 3D platformers starring the titular dog/cat/rabbit character fighting to keep his dreamworld safe from harm. Door to Phantomile was originally released in 1997 for PlayStation and was hailed as one of the best platformers of the era. Lunatae's Veil arrived in 2001 for PlayStation 2 and received similar praise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by how much Matthew made me laugh with his withering assessment of the MacGuffin in the film Red Notice being an egg, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all MacGuffin, all the time. We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has expectedly led to back-and-forth discourse about the likelihood of exclusivity. In response, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed that popular titles like Call of Duty would remain multiplatform. However, at the end of that same statement, Spencer briefly voiced Microsoft's interest "in taking similar steps to support Nintendo's successful platform." While this leaves room for interpretation, a recent CNBC interview doubles down on Spencer's final remarks meaning Microsoft might bring Call of Duty to Switch. 
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

According to a Eurogamer report, Microsoft's President Brad Smith told CNBC, "We'd like to bring [Call of Duty] to Nintendo devices. We'd like to bring the other popular titles that Activision Blizzard has, and ensure that they continue to be available on PlayStation, [and] that they become available on Nintendo." Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that future or current Call of Duty games will be developed with the Switch in mind. Still, Spencer and Smith's words might indicate a future where Call of Duty is readily available on every platform.

He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can't be a coincidence that he's perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware's action-RPG Elden Ring.
That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.

Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

The unnamed and unannounced game supposedly stars chaotic frenemy Basim, and will be more a smaller stealth-focused game rather than another rambling open-world murder-o-rama. But are we talking stealth-stealth, or Assassin's Creed stealth, or modern Ubisoft stealth?

Procedurally-generated space odyssesy No Man’s Sky becomes a pocket universe this summer when it heads to Switch, per today’s Nintendo Direct.
The Switch version doesn’t offer any drastic differences from its console and PC counterparts. The game includes every update to hit the game throughout its lifetime. That’s five years worth of additions which include base-building, multiplayer, creature-taming, underwater exploration, and much more. It’s come a long way since its infamous 2016 launch, which is one of the reasons we included it as one of the best open-world games available now.

There’s no release date for the Switch version but Hello Games will hopefully narrow that down soon.]]></summary>

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a few surprises. Among them was Disney Speedstorm, a "hero-based" combat racing game where you can take iconic Disney and Pixar characters and turn them into road warriors. The lineup includes Captain Jack Sparrow, Mulan, Mickey Mouse, Monsters Inc.'s Sulley, the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, and more (fingers crossed for Wreck-It Ralph). As you play, you can upgrade each character’s stats and utilize their unique skills. 
“To work on a dream project like Disney Speedstorm, we are driven to create a game that feels like home for Disney and Pixar fans but is also unique to the arcade-racing genre. The gameplay mechanics, the racer abilities and the location design were all tailored to serve our vision of a fast and gripping competitive experience.” says Gameloft Barcelona VP & studio manager Alexandru “Sasha” Adam. “We can’t wait to share this vision with players around the globe.” 
Publisher Gameloft, promises that Disney Speedstorm will get updated with new racers and courses regularly, and support cross-platform play when it launches free-to-play on PC and consoles sometime this year.]]></summary>

Everyone knows about Mario Kart; it’s an arcade-racing staple that people of all backgrounds and ages have enjoyed for decades. So, it’s no surprise that fans are still taking to the high-speed tracks of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe almost five years after its initial launch. Luckily, more content/support is coming that will make the eighth entry feel like a brand new chapter in the Kart-racing franchise. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass is on the way and promises a whopping 48 extra courses by 2023.

These courses will release in six total waves, with the first wave dropping on March 18. Wave 1 includes an exciting mixture of classic and recent maps like Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. If you already have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion membership, you’ll get instant access to the Booster Course Pass when the first wave is available in a few months. You can also pre-order it for $25.
We loved Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as much as its dedicated fandom. Brian Shea concluded his review by saying: 
“Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is primarily a re-release of an acclaimed game from three years ago, but by adding new content and addressing the biggest complaint of the original, this version is unquestionably the best way to experience Nintendo's great racer. Battle mode is back to its original glory, and when combined with the rest of the robust Mario Kart 8 package, it creates a great addition to the fledgling Switch library.”

Wii Sports revolutionized Nintendo's console business when it came bundled with every Wii console. That compilation disc included five rudimentary sports titles and showed players the capabilities of the Wii's then-groundbreaking motion controls. It was an immediate smash hit, attracting demographics that extended far beyond Nintendo's typical gaming audience. However, while the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the wildly popular Wii and it has its fair share of wide-reaching smash hits like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the console/handheld hybrid hasn't had another transcendent game experience like the original Wii Sports. Now, with the aptly named Nintendo Switch Sports, fans of Wii Sports can relive past glories.
Nintendo Switch Sports gathers six sports and lets you control them using the motion controls of the Switch Joy-Cons. Tennis, bowling, and chambara (swordplay) all return to the Sports series, while this iteration adds soccer, volleyball, and badminton. If you buy the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports, you also receive a Leg Strap accessory that allows your Joy-Con to track your leg, which can be used in soccer's Shootout Mode.
You can play in-person with family and friends like the original Wii Sports or play online in ranked matchmaking or against friends on your Nintendo Switch Online list. Two free updates were also announced for Nintendo Switch Sports. The first one, coming this summer, adds the ability to use the Leg Strap peripheral for the main game of soccer. This fall, another free update will add golf to the collection of sports you can play.
Nintendo Switch Sports arrives on Switch on April 29. If you'd like to check it out before then, Nintendo is hosting a special online play test from February 18 to 20, where Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can play bowling, chambara, and tennis.]]></summary>

It's rare that we get big Nintendo Directs like the 40-minute presentation today, and it's even rarer that we get any Earthbound news. Nintendo announced the SNES classic Earthbound is finally making its way to Switch, and its NES prequel dubbed Earthbound Beginnings will be joining it.
Earthbound will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection, being added to the service for no additional cost. Likewise, Earthbound Beginnings will become a new part of the Switch's NES collection. 
For those unfamiliar with Earthbound, it's a 1994 JRPG that follows a small-town boy named Ness who is tasked by a time-traveling bee to save the world from an alien invasion. Along his travels across the globe, he meets plenty of strange characters and forms a party with three other very capable children. In Japan, it's known as Mother 2, although it's the first of the series that made its way stateside.
Earthbound Beginnings is the original Mother title that didn't see release outside of Japan for 16 years. The 1989 JRPG was localized and released on Wii U in 2015. Like Earthbound, you play as a seemingly normal kid named Ninten with psychic powers who goes on a strange adventure. This is the second time Earthbound Beginnings has been made available, skipping release on 3DS and the NES Classic.
Hopefully, the release of these absolute classics will open the door for Mother 3 to see the light of day outside of Japan in some way. Start your prayer circles for the next Nintendo Direct.]]></summary>

Nintendo has revealed Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the long-awaited sequel to 2017's Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and it is scheduled to hit Switch this September. 
Closing out today's Nintendo Direct, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came as quite a surprise. That's because it showed a lot of imagery that looked similar to Xenoblade Chronicles X, the spin-off to the first Xenoblade Chronicles. Considering that's one of the last big Wii U games that hasn't yet been ported to the Switch, it seemed possible that today's direct was finally revealing that port. However, that's not the case because Nintendo and Monolith Soft are ready to move forward in the story with a threequel.

Have you vanquished Metroid Dread but are itching to push your skills to the limit? Conversely, do you find the game too difficult and want a more laid-back experience? Today's Nintendo Direct revealed that the game has a free update on the way that adds modes to make Samus' adventure on ZDR as tough or chill as you'd like.
For hardcore players, there's Dread Mode. This dastardly option makes it so that taking a single hit means instant death. Rookie Mode, on the other hand, increases the amount of health Samus' replenishes when picking up restorative items. The update goes live later today (with the free demo getting updated to include it), so you can download it soon if Dread is kicking your butt or not making you sweat enough. 
Nintendo also announced that a Boss Rush mode, where you battle bosses continually one after another, will arrive via a second update sometime in April. 
For more on Metroid Dread, check out our review. Does either mode appeal to you? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Today’s Nintendo Direct brought the surprising announcement that Live A Live is making its way to the West for the first time ever. The 1994 Super Famicom game was developed by Square and has never been officially released outside of Japan, making this a welcomed development for JRPG aficionados.
Live A Live is getting an Octopath Traveler-style facelift, sporting the same HD-2D art direction. The game stars eight heroes and is told through eight scenarios set during different time periods such as prehistory, imperial China, the Wild West, the distant future, and more. You tackle these stories in any order, and each sports a unique gameplay hook, such as stealth or telepathy. Live A Live launches for Switch on July 22.

A new Triangle Strategy demo is coming to the Nintendo eshop today on Switch, as announced during today's Nintendo Direct. Now, I know we've already had a chance to check out the Final Fantasy Tactics-style combat and social engineering political strategy in an earlier demo, but this new demo? Players can experience the game all the way until the end of chapter 3 during this demo. Probably even more relevant, progress from this demo is going to carry over into the full release!
So if you want to try out some classes and see how they perform in battle or flit around with different story strategies as to what nation you're trying to help or hinder, this is the time. Or you could just try to get a super overpowered class composition and be ready for launch. You do you, ya know? Oh, and for those that haven't played, this is a good chance to see what the game is all about!]]></summary>

Players of the original Chrono Cross have long praised it as one of the standout role-playing games of its time. Inventive characters, an intriguing dimension-hopping story, and incredibly memorable music made it a game that has stuck in the memory of gamers even decades after its original release back in 1999. The fondness players have for the series hasn’t been lost on those who hold its rights, as Square Enix has just announced that a remaster, entitled Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, is on the way to the Nintendo Switch.

Valve's landmark puzzlers, Portal and its sequel, Portal 2, are coming to the Nintendo Switch, as announced today during Nintendo's most recent Direct livestream. 
In terms of the releases, the Portal Companion Collection seems to be just that: both games in one package. The brief announcement trailer did not specify any new content coming to the games, aside from the change in platform. Nevertheless, playing the Portal games in handheld mode seems novel. 
Check out the trailer here:

No release date was given for Companion Collection, though the trailer did announce the games will be released "this year." 
For those keeping track, the Companion Collection is actually the first Valve game to be released on a Nintendo platform. The timing is somewhat coincidental, since Valve's own Switch-like console, the Steam Deck, is set to launch in a couple of weeks.]]></summary>

Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming on March 25. In today's trailer shown during the latest Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at some of Kirby's abilities in the game. 
As you'd expect, they involve him sucking items up and transforming based on what he swallowed. This ability is known as Kirby's Mouthful Mode, and when he sucks up something like a car, for example, Car Mouth is activated. In Car Mode, Kirby can race around the level, ramming through any enemies in his way.

The trailer revealed many other mouth forms like Vending Mouth, which sees Kirby suck up a vending machine that allows him to shoot juice cans at enemies, Cone Mouth, which lets him spike down on something after sucking up a cone, and more. There's also Scissor-lift Mouth, Ring Mouth, Light-Bulb Mouth, Arch Mouth, and even Water-Balloon Mouth. 
That's not everything shown in the trailer, though. We got a look at Waddle Dee Town, which is where Waddle Dee lives and home to Waddle Dee's Weapon Shop. Here, you can purchase items and evolutions like the Cutter and Chakram Cutter, Volcano Fire, Clutter Needle, Gigant Sword, Noble Ranger, Frosty Ice, and Toy Hammer. You'll need all of these and more to successfully make your way through Kirby's latest adventure in Kirby and the Forgotten Land. 
Fortunately, you don't have to wait much longer to play this game because it hits Switch on March 25. While waiting for that, read about why Kirby and the Forgotten Land might be the cutest post-apocalypse ever, and then watch this trailer released last month that showcases Kirby's copy abilities and the game's co-op mode. Read about how Nintendo has plans to celebrate Kirby's 30th anniversary in other ways this year after that.

During today’s 40-minute long Nintendo Direct, we got a glimpse at Splatoon 3’s frenetic cooperative multiplayer mode. 
Click here to watch embedded media
As per the trailer, four players are dropped onto an abandoned rig surrounded by hideous water creatures hell-bent on bringing the squad to its knees. The cutesy aesthetic of the Splatoon series is juxtaposed marvelously with the foreboding blood-red skyline, dissonant music, and tense third-person combat. Players get pitted against several powerful bosses in a wave-based system where the challenge increases depending on success. You’ll have to use your various paintball guns to slow down/vanquish enemies, transfer essential items like eggs to safe areas, and transform into an array of paint-spewing mechs. If you’ve got what it takes, maybe you’ll even get the chance to take on the Giant Salmon. 
Splatoon 3 launches sometime this summer for Nintendo Switch.]]></summary>

Front Mission is back with Front Mission 1st: Remake coming to Nintendo Switch this summer. Announced at today's Nintendo Direct, a remake of Front Mission 2 has also been announced to come to Switch at a later point in the future. Check out the entire announcement trailer below!

Front Mission is an interesting choice to resurrect into relevancy in 2022. If you ever wanted to dive into tactical RPG mech combat, Front Mission might be the place to do it. Position and move your troops around the battlefield and strategically target the opponent's various Wanzer points to gain the edge in combat. Blast off arms, legs, and other smart targets to take your enemies out quickly – or deny them access to their dangerous weapons. For all the love the series has, many Front Mission titles are not released outside of Japan. Perhaps this remake will bring some more attention to the mechanized warfare franchise!]]></summary>

After suffering a delay from its original December 2021 release, today's Nintendo Direct confirmed that Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp arrives on April 8. 
This collection bundles rebuilt versions of Advance Wars 1 and 2 that feature new 3D graphics and, as announced today, full voice-acting. In addition to conquering rival armies in the game’s two campaigns, you can also create your own stages using a map editor or take on up to three other players in Versus Mode +. 
The game was first announced during E3 2021. The Advance Wars series earned acclaim on Game Boy Advance for its steller take on turn-based strategy, but the series has been on hiatus since the Nintendo DS era. Hopefully Re-Boot Camp signals a bigger return for the beloved strategy franchise.

Today during Nintendo's latest Direct presentation, the company announced Mario Strikers: Battle League, a new entry in the series with an action-focused take on soccer. The game will be released on June 10, though pre-orders are available now. 
Twisting the original sport, Battle League pits two teams of five against each other to – as you might expect – score more goals than the opposing team. While the game can be played alone, it also features up to eight-player multiplayer and the ability to join online soccer leagues.

Also shown in the trailer are all of the gear options, which change and improve player stats. Taking a cue from other Nintendo-themed sports games, Battle League encourages players to use various attacks against their opponents – including, but not limited to, tackles, shell attacks, and "hyper strikes," which appear to be very powerful attacks. 
Nintendo announced pre-orders for Battle League are available today. The game will be released for the Nintendo Switch on June 10.]]></summary>

Nintendo has revealed Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, which, as the name implies, is a Three Houses take on the Musou Warriors spinoff.
Fire Emblem Warriors was first released back in 2017, and it was the first Warriors game set in the universe of Fire Emblem. It's back in Three Hopes, which will bring Byleth, Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and all of your favorite students and teachers from Three Houses back for the fight. Despite having the "Fire Emblem Warriors" name, this is not DLC – it's a brand-new game. It will be released on June 24 on the Nintendo Switch, so you won't have to wait too much longer now. 
Click here to watch embedded media
As for what to expect, Three Hopes sees the characters of the mainline Fire Emblem: Three Houses game return in a Musou format. If you're not familiar with that genre, you control a character who essentially wrecks through dozens of enemies at a time. It won't feature Fire Emblem's rock-paper-scissors combat as a result and will be much more action-focused. 
As you'd expect with the name, in this Warriors game, you'll be fighting enemies at the Monastery, on familiar battlefields, and more. It's unclear when in the timeline of Three Houses this game takes place. Those familiar with the original game can probably suss out when this game takes place, considering some of the events of that narrative. Only time will tell. 
While waiting for its June 24 release, read Game Informer's Fire Emblem Warriors review and check out Game Informer's Fire Emblem: Three Houses review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher's other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. 
Though pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil's statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:
In short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they're not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. 
As a reminder, assuming Microsoft's acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn't expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it's good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.]]></summary>

Your hosts for the occasion are none other than The Council of Alexes (Stadnik and Van Aken). The two Alexes are here to take your questions, react live to all the big announcements, and show the chat a good time as we see what's next for the Nintendo Switch.

Trying to predict what will be at these Nintendo Directs is like trying to catch Togetic with a Lead Ball in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. While the publishing giant hasn't said what titles will make an appearance during the longer 40 minute direct, we can venture some guesses given what we know of the company's upcoming lineup. We know Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fit within that timeframe, so it would make sense to get new looks at the exciting new Switch titles. 
Nintendo has also been steadily dropping new N64 games for Switch Online. A Direct would be a good time to continue that trend (here's hoping for Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap to celebrate the upcoming Pokémon Day on February 27). Will any of the games I listed in the first paragraph make an appearance? Probably not, or maybe yes? You'll just have to tune in live at 3:30 p.m. CT to find out. 
Thanks for watching with us, and we hope you enjoy the show! If you enjoy our live streams, be sure to head over to our Twitch channel, where you can throw us a subscription and be entered into our community Discord and stay up to the minute with Replay, Multiplayer Monday, and our Thursday gameplay streams! If you can't get enough live content, we are also streaming the first Nintendo Direct of 2022, starting at 3:30 p.m. CT!]]></summary>

The Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the first season, still well before the Fables comic series it's based on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1999, the US Army reasoned that if children enjoyed shooting people in video games, perhaps they could be encouraged to later shoot people in real life too. Thus began America's Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds. Official servers will shut down in May, though offline bits and privately owned servers will remain playable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From living room TVs to the most recent iPads, Mini LED screen tech has been catching on. Desktop monitors are trying it out as well, like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX: the very first Mini LED gaming monitor on the market when it launched late last year. As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

Tip of the iceberg. You haven’t seen his eagerness, his joie de vivre, as he swings between the many improbably-convenient floating grapple hook platforms of the world. You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab. 


By the end of my seven hours with Grapple Dog, I wanted to strangle the bastard with his own goddamn hook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite's Burial At Sea expansion explained why he's there. It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is one upside to Lost Ark having the aged tang of MMOs gone by, even if it’s specific to the visuals rather than the familiar mechanical trappings. Committing to the player numbers game of a free-to-play model for its South Korean launch back in 2019, Lost Ark always needed to perform on low-end and luxury PCs alike, and its imminent Western release is following the same rules. The result: a game that rarely looks outstanding but always runs smoothly, whether it’s on older budget hardware or the best graphics cards and CPUs of today.

The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of skateboarding game OlliOlli World sent word that Danny Trejo, of Danny Trejo fame, would feature in their video game. After filing our OlliOlli World review, I investigated and, yup, you stumble across him in one particularly fiendish level, where he is being used as promotional bait by a scheming business frog. Good thing no real company would stoop so low as to use Daniel T's likeness in such a cynical, ultimately successful way. 
Ahem. Well, if Danny Trejo can show up in this kickflip 'em up, what other cameos may appear? We used the game's character customisation menu to cook up some possibilities.

But they have now confirmed something that might not be big but is large: they plan for the expansion to feel as big as the whole base game all over again. Factorio is not a small game, so that's an impressive plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, there's this South Korean MMORPG called Mir4 that's been out on mobile and PC for about six months now. It's free-to-play, so it started off with decent numbers, but from October to November the monthly average player count jumped up by 32k. It's tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you'd think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

Not the actual guy, but the version of him in those movies, where he could clear out entire rooms using luck, martial arts and whatever he had within arm’s reach. Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good. It looks at the classics, then the modern descendants of that style, and finally puts its own unique twist on the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers offer free weekends with their games all the time, but it feels more like a trap when the game is The Sims 4. Become immersed in EA's dollhouse creation kit and what awaits you is a world of costly DLC.

But then heck, I like the game and I've only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

They're sustained by fans' hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it's the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that's making things difficult. You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

He's one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio's classic RPG Nox? That's Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of "best of" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A coalition of Hollywood studios plus Amazon, Netflix and Apple is urging a court in the US to issue an urgent injunction to prevent two pirate IPTV services from infringing their rights. In parallel, the defendant's legal team argues that the plaintiffs' case is not only deficient but relies on 'expert' evidence that is both biased and inaccurate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have played Vampire Survivors twice - that’s two (2) times - in total. In only that short space of time, the arcade-style game has sunk its teeth into me. You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

I am therefore extremely grateful for Narrative Device, a browser-based AI doodad which generates the opening paragraph of a story based on two themes or things you feed into it. Finally, some help for the writers of the world! It's potentially interesting and useful, or at the very least it is fun to make a computer say silly things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is going all in on our favourite finishing moves. This doesn't just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term 'the GG push'. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew's celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

"So good it will give you blisters," it says of the latest polygonal bloodsport, with a wired controller hanging from a ceiling, covered in gore. The hyperbole of a generation, a distortion of edgy marketing either aped or mocked by today's advertising sophisticates. You get blisters from walking up hills, not video games. In the forensically sucky cyberpresent of 2022, there is no place for such exaggeration.

Steam Deck support, caves in the Mountains biome, a pretty moth in the Mistlands... okay, sure.

This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it's the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game's textures and models with high-def versions, they've tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I'm not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I'll be honest, I've been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. "Look how much emotion their faces show now!" was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.
