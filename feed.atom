        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meet Apollo, the god of music
Hades is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my go-to game at the start of the pandemic, and after all was said and done I think I put close to 400 hours into that bad boy. I have played and replayed Hades to death, so anything new to help switch it up is a welcome change. Enter Apollo — the Greek god of music who was left off of the game's original lineup, but has since been added to the game by way of a mod thanks to AlexKage's project, OlympusExtra, which was originally spotted by ResetEra.
The mod adds Apollo to the game as if he were just like any of the other gods, including Boons (solo and duo), a Keepsake, a Wrath (you know, the environmental attack the gods spring on you when you're in a two-Boon chamber), and of course, plenty of dialogue. An artist named Reikiix did Apollo's portrait, which honestly looks so good you can't tell that it wasn't part of the base game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbeHCKiDB7M
Apollo's specialty is a blinding effect, which makes enemies more likely to miss their attacks. I can imagine that would go really well with Aphrodite or Athena's Boons if you want to go for a low-damage or even no-hit run. There are already some videos out there of modders playing with the Apollo mod, so those might be worth checking out if you want to see what he can do to help Zagreus escape the Underworld.
OlympusExtra is still in its early stages — not only will Apollo's inclusion of the game be more built out in the future with some more voice lines and duo Boons on the way, but other gods will also be added to the mix, including Hera, Hestia, and Hephaestus. Hades has fostered a huge cult following since its release in 2020, and it's great to see the modding community getting in on the action.

As part of the Limited Run Games summer showcase, wherein the retailer revealed its long laundry list of physical releases for 2022-2023, it was announced that Dotemu's cool-looking brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge will be getting a hard copy on PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.
All three versions will include a disc/cart-based copy of Shredder's Revenge, a full-color art booklet, a set of character stickers, a reversible cover, and, in a nice little throwback, a voucher for a free personal pan pizza at participating branches of Pizza Hut. This neat bonus is, of course, a throwback to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Arcade Game on NES, which also included a free pizza with each purchase!
https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1533910176637517827?s=20&t=1OyPR7h4FbGbLewoOupIfg
It seems like Limited Run really had to pull some strings and do some serious organizing in order to get the pizza tie-in promotion on board, and as such, the offer is only redeemable at North American outlets and is tied exclusively to the Limited Run edition of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Still, it's a very cute, unique, and nostalgic freebie, especially for those who can actually eat pizza, unlike your feather-stomached boy Moyse. Regardless, pre-orders are now live on the Limited Run Games store.
While no images were shown, Limited Run also has a full Collector's Edition of the cartoon brawler in the works, which will include all of the above gubbins along with a Playmates figure of Shredder himself, replicated from the megaselling 1990s toy line. More details on this edition will be revealed in the near future.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge launches 2022 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a few PlayStation studios that we haven't heard much from in a while, one of which is the Days Gone developers Bend Studio. That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.
The post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There's a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it's worked on or created before. 
"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right," writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.
This is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won't be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony's new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.
Bend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it's now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.
For more on Bend Studio's former projects or what never came to be, check out what the studio pitched for a sequel to Days Gone that never saw the light of day.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-07T20:00:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something to look forward to
E3 was already struggling before the pandemic hit, so its gradual departure over the past few years seemed to be a long time coming. While it may not have taken anyone by surprise, it was still pretty sad to see an event that had become such a staple of the gaming industry close its doors indefinitely. We've had plenty of other news streams to keep us busy, but it just hasn't quite been the same. So naturally, we're pretty excited to hear from the Entertainment Software Association (the organization that runs E3) that the event will be back fully in person in 2023 after three years, as they told The Washington Post.
As ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis told the site: "We’re excited about coming back in 2023 with both a digital and an in-person event. As much as we love these digital events, and as much as they reach people and we want that global reach, we also know that there’s a really strong desire for people to convene—to be able to connect in person and see each other and talk about what makes games great."

E3 had already been in a transition period before the pandemic hit — the event had been struggling with attendance and its own identity for years. They were making big changes, like allowing fans to attend what was previously a trade-only event in 2015, but even that wasn't enough to keep them afloat with many of the large companies opting for their own solo press conferences.
While it can be a lot of fun to have one huge event to look forward to every year, some have considered the benefits of sunsetting E3 for good, like more games being able to stand out when the press is paced more evenly throughout the year, rather than being dumped on us all at once.
As an LA local, I'd love to be able to go in person again for E3 2023, but I know for others it's not that simple. I guess now it's just a waiting game to see if the ESA actually pulls through on this one.

This week is the week of the E3-that-wasn't, and even if the giant expo won't be around to entertain us, the giants of the games industry have seemingly managed to put together a whole bunch of showcases all the same.
But we still aren't sure what Nintendo's showing will be, or if we'll even get a Nintendo Direct alongside all the other presentations. But on the assumption that we will, we've put together a list of everything we know about a bunch of games that have either dropped off the radar for a while, or haven't had any concrete release information in a long time, to figure out what we should/could be ready for.

But with clever implementation of said metal music, Metal Hellsinger looks to transcend the spiritual successor label to become something else entirely.
By combining that fast-paced, frenetic first-person shooting action with rhythm-based mechanics that reward you for shooting in sync with the music, Metal Hellsinger delivers a wholly unique experience. While the gameplay conventions help separate the game from the pack, it's perhaps the original soundtrack that is most eye-catching.

According to a report from Imran Khan of Fanbyte, Nintendo inside sources have confirmed that a sequel to the Switch launch mini-game pack, 1-2-Switch, is in the works — and that the internal feedback has been "brutal", calling the game "boring".
The game is tentatively titled Everybody's 1-2-Switch, and reportedly takes the multiplayer aspect of the first game, and turns it from a local party game into an online game with up to 100 players, inspired by the Jackbox Games approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Crash Bros.
In the week of summer streamin', one can always expect a flurry of leaks and rumors, and 2022 is no exception. Regarding everyone's favorite crate-smashing psycho, Crash Bandicoot, the word on the street is that publisher Activision and developer Toys for Bob are preparing to reveal a brand new brawler/platform fighter starring Crash and The Boys... umm...
The rumor was sparked by Window Central writer (and known spoiler) Jez Corden, speaking on a new episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast. According to Corden, Toys for Bob is beavering away at the new title, which is expected to be a chaotic platform fighter in the style of games such as MultiVersus, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and, of course, Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. While the conversation on the podcast was a little spirited and jokey, there was a clear inference that the title could be revealed during this week's run of "non-E3" live streams.
Crash Bandicoot, as a franchise, has certainly gotten to the point where it has enough beloved characters to launch its own fighting game. And given that it has already run the gamut of kart racers, puzzle titles, and mobile spin-offs, it seems that stepping it the ring is one of the few genres left for Crash, Coco, Cortex, and co. are left to conquer. I have already decided that Ripper Roo is my main, and we don't even know if he is in the Crash Bandicoot brawler... or even if there is a Crash Bandicoot brawler! I guess we'll just have to keep 'em peeled as the week progresses.
You can check out the full episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast below.

We've seen our fair share of custom designs for retro consoles over the years, but we reckon this one takes the cake. Swedish audio-visual artist Love Hultén has created all-in-one devices for the Famicom system and the SNES, combining the genuine consoles with a 9" Sony Trinitron PVM-9042QM display monitor.
The result is not only one of the most stunning pieces of artwork we've ever seen, but actually functions exactly as you'd want it to. Each creation contains a cartridge slot just in the front of the monitor itself, with more slots in the top of the devices to store your wireless controllers and any additional cartridges.

Out with the old, in with the new. Nintendo Switch Online Zelda rewards are now live, and you can grab them until July 4 at 6PM PT, when they'll be cycled out for something else.
The Switch Online Zelda icons include several Link poses (of course), as well as a smiling Daruk, a Guardian about to destroy someone, Purah, the Zelda logo, and a piece of raw prime meat. Nintendo is putting out the first "wave" through June 13 at 5:59PM PT. After that we'll get several more ways until we hit that July 4 marker, and Breath of the Wild rotates out. So if you don't find a style you like this week, wait until the next wave! Also, if you're interested, you can find the June Animal Crossing villager birthday icons below.
Need points for the Switch Online Zelda icons? As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

There were familiar brands and IPs such as Shantae, Blade Runner, Doom, Tetris, and Star Wars lined up alongside radical '80s/'90s franchises such as TMNT, Bill & Ted, Shadowrun, and even the classic horror adventure, D. Oh, and that PS5 port of Night Trap we all wanted is finally on the way, because that's what we bought that $500 console for. Right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And we're mesmerised.
Nintendo has shared a short and shiny new trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, showcasing the gorgeous world of Aionios.
At just a minute long, there's no drama, no character action, and no combat — just the sights and sounds of the game's stunning-looking world. From the monsters roaming it to the fauna, to familiar locations to giant mechs, Aionios looks like it'll have secrets to uncover, and we already don't want to leave. There's also that good ol' Territorial Rotbart standing loud and proud in the grasslands — we can't wait to run into him while severely under-levelled!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 1 kicks off in Battlefield 2042 on June 9
More tools for mayhem are arriving on the battlefield. Electronic Arts and DICE debuted a trailer today, showing what's coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1 on June 9, 2022.
In today's trailer, the team gives us a good look at Exposure, the new map arriving in Season 1. It's set in the Canadian Rockies and looks to make big use of verticality, allowing aircraft and wingsuits to really get around.
Also shown is the new Specialist, Ewelina Lis. Lis is particularly skilled at tackling vehicles, using a remote-controlled rocket launcher to wreak havoc on armor.

Alongside those, new vehicles and weapons are also coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1. Two new gunships, the RAH-68 Huron and YG-99 Hannibal, take to the skies. The BSV-M Marksman Rifle offers a new mid-range option. And the Smoke Grenade launcher offers some infantry ground cover.
But good lord, the Ghostmaker R10 Crossbow looks like a blast. Literally, because it has explosive ammo, alongside regular, light, and heavy ammo. The core content additions are available as part of the free Battle Pass track, though it will require playing to unlock. Additional cosmetics are in the Premium Battle Pass Track.
Seasoned veterans
There are also more fixes for stability, balance, gunplay, performance, and more. It looks like DICE is trying to make good on its commitment to improving Battlefield 2042 after its rough launch.
The focus comes at the cost of some initial pillars, like the removal of the 128-player Breakthrough variant. The team also shuttered all future content development for Hazard Zone, its Tarkov-style multiplayer mode, in favor of focusing on its other pillars.
With Season 1 for Battlefield 2042 finally going live, it seems like this could be the time for DICE to rally and try to right the ship. Exploding crossbow bolts are a good start, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pixel punishment.
In anime, there is a popular genre called isekai, which means “another world” and is characterised by the protagonist travelling from their normal, boring world into one filled with magic and monsters. Normally, it is a light-hearted affair, with the main character settling into their new life and eventually managing to save their new home while also falling in love with one or more well-endowed ladies. Lost Ruins shows a more brutal side of the isekai formula, sending a young woman into a dark and dangerous castle and tasking her with surviving.
Developed by Altari Games, Lost Ruins is a survival-focused Metroidvania in which the player controls a young woman who has been summoned to a dungeon with no memories of who she is, even forgetting her own name. She is told by the suspiciously helpful mage Beatrice that she has been summoned to the castle to defeat the Dark Lady that has been sealed away in the castle. According to Beatrice, defeating the monsters that guard the Dark Lady is the key to restoring the Heroine’s memories.

The collaboration brings costumes featuring the Blue Blur and his closest friends into the zany multiplayer experience.
Beginning in August, Fall Guys players can take the form of Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails during this new Sonic collaboration. For those unfamiliar with Fall Guys, this is far from the only collaboration the game has ever done, nor is this the first collaboration with the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. The initial appearance of the Blue Blur in Fall Guys came in 2020, but this new collaboration expands the offerings.
Starting June 21, Fall Guys not only comes to new platforms like Xbox and Switch, but it also goes free-to-play across all platforms. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout originally launched in August 2020 and quickly became one of the most-played multiplayer games.

Up until now, we've only seen footage of separate aspects of the game — one look at the gameplay, and one look at the combat — but IGN has actually spent some time with the game. Four hours, even! But it's worth noting that IGN's hands-on with the game is from an early build, so there's still plenty to iron out.

It's called 50 Years of Text Games: From Oregon Trail to A.I. Dungeon, and it's a compilation of fifty text games from 1971 through to the modern day. The book covers games like 1985's A Mind Forever Voyaging alongside newer hits, like inkle's 80 Days, Failbetter's Fallen London, and the surprisingly unnerving A Dark Room, to explore what interactive fiction can do without images, and how IF has changed the face of gaming with just a few (hundred thousand) words.

An iOS Switch update is on the way, with the intent of adding full Switch Pro Controller and Switch Joy-Con support to all applicable iOS devices. Note that this is for iOS 16, which is currently being tested by developers (and intrepid folks who simply sign up for it); and is scheduled to arrive in the fall of this year. In case you're keeping track, iOS now supports PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X, and Joy-Con controllers once this update is pushed.
The news broke by way of Riley Testut, an iOS developer, who noted that the Switch Pro Controller and single J0y-Con will work natively in iOS: showing up in the Bluetooth section as the properly named devices. Interestingly, pairing both the left (L) and right (R) Joy-Con will also allow the devices to work in tandem as a single device. As Testut points out, you can use a simple command (hold screenshot + home) to swap between single Joy-Con and multi-Joy-Con modes at will. When pairing, just make sure you hold the pairing button on each Joy-Con.
It really is a comprehensive iOS Switch facelift, as you can technically play a ton of games that are found on the Switch eShop and also on iOS with the same control method. Options!

It seems like they updated their careers site in April, though, with two new roles: A "battle planner" and a designer. From these two job descriptions, we can find out a little bit more about the game (note: translations are from Google Translate, so take them with a pinch of salt):

Well I'll be durned, I was sure that last week's explosive "Launcher" trailer was the last character trailer we'd be seeing for Nexon's upcoming scrapper DNF Duel — and yet the funky looking fighter keeps on giving with a brand new video revealing the gun-toting, swooneriffic desperado, Troubleshooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7luVBKogBKk&t
As you can see from the above video, Troubleshooter is another DNF Duel firearms user, though has more of an old west, gunslinger aesthetic when compared to the hi-tech talents of Launcher. In the preview, we see the old dawg utilizing his meaty-looking sidearms at both long and short distances, while also laying several traps in order to control space. Troubleshooter looks to be a somewhat complex character, but one that can easily control their opponent's space, shutting down options and presenting risk from all angles.
He's also handsome as all hell, teasing the viewer with roses and sweet nothings. DNF Duel may be the horniest fighter to come down the line in some time, frankly. You'll be able to join the love-in very soon, as DNF Duel will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28. While you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, and Launcher.

May was a quiet month for the video game industry. With no major game releases (Nintendo Switch Sports just got ahead on April 29th - yeah, we thought that was a May title, too!), overall sales were down by 22%. In terms of hard figures, 100,000 games consoles were sold, 1.63 million games (both digital and physical), and 460,000 accessories.
Compared to April, which saw the release of the aforementioned Nintendo Switch Sports and LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, sales were down by 32%. LEGO Star Wars remains at the top of the charts for month, however this too saw a massive drop in sales, falling 87% month-on-month. Additionally, although LEGO Star Wars took the overall number 1 spot, Nintendo Switch Sports saw the most physical sales during May and FIFA 22 won out in terms of digital sales.

Last year, Nintendo was successful in securing a jail term for Team Xecutor member Gary Bowser, who was accused of causing the Japanese company to lose millions of dollars via the piracy-enabling devices and software he sold.
Court documents are now available which fill in some of the additional detail relating to the case, in which Bowser was sentenced for three years and ordered to pay an extortionate amount of cash as a fine.

You might remember earlier this year that N64 platformer Glover got a rerelease on Steam — but not on Switch oddly enough. And while that Switch port still hasn't been announced, retro game collectors can at least get a little bit excited for what's coming up for the white glove-starring game.
Limited Run Games announced that it will be giving this oft-forgotten platformer some hands-on love with a retro rerelease. That's right, Glover will be getting a brand new N64 cart in the year 2022. It's not the first game Limited Run Games has done a retro re-release for, but it's perhaps not our very first choice.

Wholesome. It's a word that gets tossed around a lot these days when it comes to games. If there's a game with a cat, a tea minigame, a pastel palette, and/or some kind of farming mechanic, you bet your buns it'll be called "wholesome" at least once.
Wholesome Direct, a showcase of indie games presented by the independent, volunteer-run Wholesome Games team, has been gathering steam over the last couple of years as a source of games that eschew traditional power fantasies and violence in favour of softer, gentler storylines. Their upcoming 100-game not-E3 showcase on Saturday, June 11th promises to be no different.

Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

So uh, don't buy the KOTOR Switch bundle until after June 8, when the second game is out. Weird, right? Bundles and the eShop: sometimes a bad combination!
As we've established, Knights of the Old Republic II is out on June 8. KOTOR 1 came out on Switch on November 11, 2021. If you individually buy the latter outside of the bundle, you can play it right now, no issues. But if you buy the bundle, KOTOR 1 will be locked to the SKU of the second game, and won't work until June 8. Lame, right?

Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

Legendary developer/publisher Capcom is getting in on the summer streaming lark, and has announced that it will be hosting its own dedicated "Capcom Showcase" live stream on June 13. The stream is expected to last around 35 minutes and will feature updates on previously announced Capcom titles.
While the itinerary for the show will be released at a later date, it seems likely that we can expect hot news and footage from Resident Evil Village VR/DLC, Resident Evil 4 Remake, Pragmata, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, and, of course, Street Fighter 6. Capcom has been on an undeniable roll these past three years, releasing hit after hit and watching its own stock climb high. The company will no doubt be hoping to continue its success into 2023 and beyond.
If you want to check out the action for yourself, then you can tune into the stream on Monday, June 13, at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The Capcom Showcase will be hosted on the company's social media channels, including YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. We will also be hosting the event right here on Destructoid, so join us for half an hour of thrilling updates and grumpy discourse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A massive 1.0 update for Battlefield 2042 is out now on all platforms, and it brings hundreds of changes, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements to the online shooter ahead of its Season 1 launch. 
And speaking of Season 1: Zero Hour, DICE will reveal gameplay today at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET on its official Battlefield 2042 YouTube channel, as reported by VG247. There, you’ll see a glimpse of these changes and improvements and a look at what the first season of Battlefield 2042 looks like. As for the update, here’s what Dice has highlighted: 
Multiple improvements to soldier gameplay which will result in overall smoother animations and movement.
Weapons received updated netcode to improve bullet hit registration. We’ve also done a further balance pass which includes increased projectile speeds for DMR’s and LMG’s, and improved accuracy for Shotguns.
Multiple new XP events have been added, such as for killing an enemy who recently wounded or killed a squadmate, or when an enemy vehicle you recently damaged is destroyed by a teammate and the occupants are killed
The number of available in-world vehicles has been increased for Conquest which should make it easier to move across the map
Sundance’s Wingsuit has been adjusted to lower overall flight time, while making it easier to maneuver. To simplify their Specialty, the EMP Field Smart Explosive has been removed
Dice is scheduling the next update for early July, but it’s “a smaller update that brings further fixes and changes to the battlefield.” Head to Dice’s full patch notes list for the complete list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements. 
While waiting for today’s Season 1 debut, read Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review and read about how the next Battlefield has entered pre-production with “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. Check out Dice’s response to Battlefield 2042 map complaints and feedback afterward.

The stunning revelation that maybe you shouldn’t expect too many brand-new AAA game reveals following a global pandemic came through an audio broadcast on Twitter Spaces over the weekend, transcribed by VGC. “We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,” Keighley said, “but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I’m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.”

The latest trailer for Netflix's Resident Evil live-action series is out. Amid the Umbrella messaging and world full of zombies, it really does seem to be doing its own thing with the source material.
The series looks to take place in two different eras: in a world overrun by zombies, and in the past, showing events leading up to the fall.
The past shows Umbrella developing new advancements that come at a cost. As Lance Reddick's Wesker states, the T-Virus is contained in some products, leading to "monsters." And you can guess what will follow.
We jump forward to the future, and it goes from impending horror to all-out World War Z. The world seems essentially overrun with various biological horrors.

New frontiers
A few Sonic the Hedgehog projects are already in the works that could easily appear here. There's Sonic Frontiers, which has been steadily rolling out new looks at gameplay as part of IGN's First program this month. The early looks at open-world exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat have been getting some mixed reception though. Sega has said Sonic Frontiers is arriving in 2022.
There's also the retro collection Sonic Origins. This packages in a bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog classics, including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. We got a glimpse at the Mirror Mode option recently, which looks wild. We already know the release date for Sonic Origins though, and it's not far off. The retro collection is aiming for June 23, 2022.
As for expanded content, there is a third Sonic the Hedgehog movie in the works. Knuckles is getting his own live-action series as well, and the Sonic Prime series on Netflix. Sonic media is growing to encompass a lot, and we could get hints about what's in store along those lines.
The Sonic Central does arrive right at the vanguard of a stacked week for streams too. Thursday is the Summer Game Fest Live kickoff, followed by several days of streams including Xbox, the Wholesome Direct, and the PC Gaming Show. You can find a full schedule of all the upcoming streams here.

Punch-Out!! was one of the games I played for the first time, later in my life, that saved retro gaming for me. I still haven’t beaten it. I’ve reached Super Macho Man, I think. Progress is just so slow at that point that I eventually get distracted and move on to something else.
That has nothing to do with Beam Software’s Power Punch II. Well, not nothing. You would have to be blind to not look at it and see it as having lifted Punch-Out!!’s formula. That’s nothing new for the industry, though. Power Punch II just happens to have been catapulted to notoriety due to a rumor and its uncanny resemblance. It’s a rather strange game, but it’s one where the ability to judge it by its own merits has been lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 23 is coming in August with some new tech set to change the game entirely on both sides of the ball. Our own Brian Shea recently went hands-on with the latest version of Madden and its game-changing feature FieldSense, which encompasses a variety of changes to gameplay and animations. You can check out a deep dive into everything FieldSense offers in the video above.
FieldSense, which is exclusive to the newest generation of consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S), has a few different aspects that are covered in the video by senior game design director for Madden NFL 23, Connor Dougan. First is a set of new physics-informed animation as well as animation branching technology that brings a more realistic look to the action on the field. New gameplay techniques like 360 Cuts introduce more control for receivers and running backs, while Hit Everything is a feature that affects just about everything on the defensive side of the ball. For Quarterbacks, Skill Based Passing will let players fine-tune where they're throwing the ball for more precise passes that can be kept away from pass defenders. There are demonstrations of those new concepts and more in the almost five-minute breakdown.
Madden NFL 23 lands on August 19 this year with the man himself, John Madden, gracing the cover. While FieldSense is only available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, other versions of the game are also coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-06T21:23:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back at E3 2021, we learned that Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, one of the strangest FMV games of the ’90s, was getting remastered for modern consoles courtesy of Limited Run Games. Now we know that John, Jane, and Thresher will return later this year. 
The news comes by way of today's Limited Run Presents showcase. What the heck is Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, you ask? The 1993 game is best described as an interactive romantic comedy firmly aimed at adults, thanks to its mild nudity and sexual innuendo. Players guide a plumber named John, who tries to win the heart of a beautiful woman named Jane in an adventure laden with ridiculous hijinks. That includes dealing with an unreliable narrator and confronting a, shall we say, creepy boss. The gameplay involves making simple decisions in a choose-your-own-adventure format and watching live-action cutscenes. 
To editorialize a bit, Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties is absurd and pretty bad. However, as footage of the game found its way on YouTube over the years, the game has found new life as a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” oddity, not unlike Night Trap (which got a similar remaster a few years ago). Since Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties had a limited release on PC and the poor-selling 3DO console, not many folks have been able to play it themselves. 
The Definitive Edition polishes up the adventure with 4K visuals and adds features such as deleted scenes, a progress chart, and new video interviews with the cast. 
Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties: Definitive Edition launches later this year for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be available both digitally and in physical form, thanks to Limited Run Games. If you’re into FMV games, check out this deep-dive feature about the history of the genre.]]></summary>

For those of you still exploring the luscious-but-deadly pastures of Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games has a brand new update for you. As revealed during last week's Sony State of Play presentation, Update 1.14 brings new several new features and modes to the stunning open-world adventure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3worI7QeCHQ
First and perhaps foremost, Horizon Forbidden West update 1.14 adds the much-requested New Game+ mode for those who have already completed Aloy's adventure. These players can now restart the story, locked and loaded with gear, skills, and abilities for a low-intensity run through the epic campaign. For those who wish to press themselves further forward, the new Ultra Hard difficulty option will test your hunting and acrobatic skills to the absolute limit.
For players who feel they may have perhaps focused Aloy's growing talents in the wrong areas, the new Respec option will rebank all of your acquired skill points, allowing for a fresh build on Aloy's skill tree. And for the fashion-forward, the new Transmog option will allow you to select any of your gathered gear (including all respective effects) while retaining the visual appearance of any other outfit. So if you have a favorite look for yer girl, then you can keep on rocking that visual style regardless of your actual equipped clothing, armour, and headgear.
Last, but by no means least, the new update features a fresh round of bug stomps and visual tweaks, the details of which you can find in the official patch notes right here.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms.

Beware, the footage does contain violence, gore, and adult language.


Resident Evil takes place in two time periods, 2022 and 2036, following Jade Wesker (Ella Balinska) before and after the T-Virus is unleashed on the public, causing all kinds of monsters such as zombie people, zombie dogs, and the biggest monster of them all, pharmaceutical corporations. There's also a kaiju-sized caterpillar, and that's pretty cool too! The series also stars Lance Reddick as Albert Wesker, Tetiana Gaidar, and Connor Gosatti.

CyGames has released its previously teased major update for attractive fighter Granblue Fantasy: Versus. Now available on both PlayStation and PC platforms, Update 2.80 adds three major new mechanics to the super-stylish and surprisingly sexy anime ring rocker.
The first new mechanic, "Rush", is a quick forward dash that can be activated at the cost of half of your SBA meter. The dash is strike-invincible just after startup, but can still be shut down by projectiles. The purpose of dash is to perfect the timing of the player's advance in order to gain ground in the face of a heavy assault from the opponent. Think of it ala tactical rolls in The King of Fighters, except lacking projectile invincibility. Rush can also be linked with certain attacks in order t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. 
What I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 made a big splash during its PlayStation State of Play showing last week, revealing two more fighters, some sort of exploration story mode, and more. While we await more details on some of those features, Capcom has divulged some info on Ryu's new look and the game's place in the Street Fighter timeline.
The game's official Twitter account shared a statement by director Takayuki Nakayama that confirms Street Fighter 6 takes place after the events of Street Fighter III. This places the game at the end of the series' timeline given that Street Fighter V is set before SF 3. 
As for Ryu's new look, Nakayama explains his Buddhist robe, also called a kasaya, showcases Ryu's newfound dignity despite the warrior feeling he's "not there yet." What that means is up to interpretation, but the attire does pair well with Ryu's dashing beard if nothing else. 
"Although Street Fighter 6 occurs after the Street Fighter III series, Ryu still feels that he's "not there yet" - though he seems to have gained some dignity. The way he wears the kasaya (Buddhist robe) is reminiscent of his master, Goken."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No longer a silent brawl
Nickelodeon's cartoon mash-up brawler is getting a much-requested addition today. Full character voice-over for the whole roster hits Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl today alongside items in a free update for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.
When Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl first launched, its lack of voice-over for its roster was notable. Today, GameMill Entertainment and Ludosity are updating the brawl to add exactly that.
The voices behind characters including SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke), Ren & Stimpy (Billy West), Garfield (Frank Welker), and Korra (Janet Varney) will be included in this new update. So now, it won't be so ominously quiet as SpongeBob and Korra duke it out in the arena.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIuGYhVDAis
The other major addition in today's free update to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is items. The cartoon brawler launched without any pick-up-and-use items. Now, items like Sokka's boomerang, a Krabby Patty, and a Reptar toy will be optional drops.
Are you ready?
The lack of both voice-over work and items were big detractors from Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, so it's good to see both finally being added. The update is rolling out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Nintendo Switch owners will get it "soon," according to GameMill.
Maybe with this addition, the brawls will have a little more life to them. Games like Super Smash Bros. might have developed prominent competitive scenes, but a lot of the charm in those platform fighters also comes from the characters themselves. Captain Falcon is visually recognizable, but so is his declaration of "FALCON PUNCH."
The good news is, if you're now eager to try Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl after its addition of voices, it's easy to do so. The cartoon brawler is one of this month's PlayStation Plus games, so subscribers can pretty easily hop on and try out the update for themselves.

The last time we checked in with Diablo Immortal, things were going decent enough. Immortal shows pretty well on mobile, but with the pre-release review period ending, I shifted gears a bit into the PC edition to see how that one held up.
I wasn't ready for the dark underbelly of microtransactions, which reared up in the live version.

We got to see some new and familiar places, along with some familiar faces.
Very shortly after the teaser trailer's premiere, model Ella Freya took to social media to excitedly identify herself as the face model for spritely damsel-in-distress, Ashley Graham.

Developer Ludosity has announced it's finally adding character voices and items to the game today.
Alongside voice acting and items, here are the latest patch notes! pic.twitter.com/gfTHwtz4Tj
June 6, 2022
Paired with some substantial character balance adjustments and stage changes, Nick Brawl's fighters will now have voices, with many of the original actors for these characters reprising their roles. This includes what looks to be a big rework of Sandy, which you can see in the embedded tweet above. Here's the complete cast list as revealed by the Nick Brawl Twitter account: 
Jim Cummings: Shredder / CatDog (Cat)
Tom Kenny: Spongebob / CatDog (Dog)
Bill Fagerbakke: Patrick
Carolyn Lawrence: Sandy
Alex Cazares: Oblina
Jim Meskimen: Nigel Thornberry
Richard Horvitz: Zim
Vivian Vencer: Toph
Dustin Sardella: Aang
Janet Varney: Korra
Fred Tatasciore: Reptar
Bentley Griffin: Lincoln Loud
Jessica DiCicco: Lucy Loud
Franchesca Marie Smith: Helga
Townsend Coleman: Michelangelo
Cam Clarke: Leonardo
Abby Trott: April O'Neil
Frank Welker: Garfield
Billy West: Ren & Stimpy
David Kaye: Powdered Toast Man
David Kaufman: Danny Phantom
Janice Kawaye: Jenny
With the entire cast getting voiced, it's safe to assume upcoming characters Hugh Neutron and Rocko will receive the same treatment. As stated before, items are also joining the game, but there's almost no detail on what those items may be or what they do in battle. We'll just have to play to find out.
The new Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl patch hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC today, with the Switch update coming later. PlayStation Plus members can claim a free copy of Nick Brawl until the end of June as part of the PS+ monthly game offerings alongside God of War and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.]]></summary>

Xbox is hosting not one, but two showcases over the next week or so. While the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase airs on June 12, an Xbox Games Showcase Extended will air on June 14.
This bonus showcase will feature some new trailers and deeper looks at the news from the preceding Games Showcase. Developers and game creators will appear on the stream too. It'll last about 90 minutes, airing at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET on Twitch, YouTube, and other major streaming platforms.
The Xbox Games Showcase Extended will air in English, Latin America Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, and French. Audio Descriptions and American Sign Language will also be available live.

The Xbox and Bethesda showcase is airing at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET on June 12, and is expected to contain info about the lineup coming to both Xbox and PC, as well as some updates on Game Pass.
The show goes on
This extension now brings the end of the summer showcase streaming out from Sunday and into Tuesday. That said, for Xbox fans, it's a good sign they'll be seeing some more of the games talked about at the Xbox and Bethesda presser.
With both Starfield and Redfall slipping out to 2023, it'll be interesting to see what ends up populating the showcase Microsoft over these two days. Even if the games have moved forward, I'm hopeful there will be some news to share either way.
There are also some big titles we haven't heard from in a while, like the upcoming Fable and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. And other studios at Microsoft have been quiet for a little while now too. Maybe we even hear some more about that Indiana Jones project?
We'll see what Xbox, Bethesda, and the many Xbox studios have in the works on both June 12 and June 14.

Internal safety videos, especially in the YouTube era, are a great source of comedy without even having to try too hard. That's why this Nintendo safety video rules so hard: it dials up that absurdity by adding Wario, master of chaos, into the mix.
For the most part, the 15 minute video isn't all that different from a run of the mill requirement you may have been forced to watch for employment at some point, but this one has random injerctions from Wario, which is clearly not voiced by Charles Martinet. Here's the rundown from Forest of Illusion, who uploaded the video to YouTube:
"We have preserved an internal Nintendo employee safety video disc from 2004! The video was intended for Nintendo Merchandising Inc representatives and features Wario, who mentions that he is his own supervisor at Nintendo, as he assists the narrator in walking new hires through the safety precautions one must take when working with Nintendo retail products within stores."

One of the best moments of the video is the near the start. Wario tells the soothing grandpa-voiced narrator to "shut up," and he just responds with "take it easy, Wario." No exclamation point needed: it's that soothing. Also that music is extremely Wii Sports adjacent!

At the weekend, Sega Japan announced that it was releasing a new piece of portable hardware in the form of the Sega Mega Drive Mini II, a pint-sized edition of the 1993 console that will come pre-loaded with 50 Sega Mega Drive and Mega CD classics. Given that the Mega Drive Mini already exists, some fans might be puzzled as to why Sega has not instead focused on releasing a scaled-down model of its 1994 console, Sega Saturn, or its 1998 big brother, the Sega Dreamcast.
Speaking with Famitsu, Sega hardware producer Yosuke Okunari offered up the unfortunate news that a Sega Saturn Mini or a Sega Dreamcast Mini are both very unlikely to ever see the light of day. Okunari understands that the audience is there for such consoles, but states that a combination of expensive components, further hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on manufacturing costs, has simply made the project uneconomical from both a production and finance perspective.
Okunari also suggested that the components used by Sega's Mini consoles are not quite up-to-spec in regards to running Sega Saturn titles — a console that is notoriously difficult to authentically emulate. Okunari jokes that the process of producing a Sega Saturn Mini in 2022 might see it launch with a price rivaling that of modern-day consoles. So it seems, for now at the very least, the Mega CD is as far as we are going in regards to the Sega Mini range.
The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 launches in Japan October 27, priced at ¥9,980 (roughly $75 USD). Sega is yet to confirm whether this edition will also be released in the west. For more details on the console, check out @gosokkyu's Twitter thread translating/paraphrasing the Famitsu interview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last weekend's Pokémon Go Fest delivered two days of catching fun, along with the debuts of Nihilego and Shaymin within the mobile game. Now, Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game are crossing over with events that will touch both games. For Pokémon Go, the event begins on June 16 and brings the chance to catch Wimpod and a new version of Pikachu wearing a TCG hat.
For the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the next expansion is themed around Pokémon Go, and will feature cards based on Team Mystic, Instinct, and Valor. We'll have to wait to see just how many of the cards are true crossovers, but no matter what, it's great seeing these two popular games work together.
For the mobile trainers out there, Wimpod is one of those Pokémon that requires 400 candies to evolve. When this number is hit, Wimpod evolves into Golisopod. The creature that looks a bit like a dead fish transforms into one of the coolest Godzilla-like beasts in all of Pokémon.
This event also sees Mewtwo returning to five-star raids. All Mewtwo caught from June 16 to June 23 will have the Shadow Ball charged attack. Those caught from June 23 to July 1 will have the Psystrike charged attack.
If you use the Mystery Box during the event, you'll have the chance to catch a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box is only obtained by sending a Pokémon to Pokémon Home or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It's a bit of a hassle to get the Box, but it's well worth it, as Meltan is great for battling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest kicks off in earnest this week, and one of the biggest presentations will be the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase on June 12. If you watch the show and find yourself clamoring for more information, Microsoft has announced an extended version of the presentation a couple of days later.
On June 14, the Xbox Games Showcase Extended airs at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern. This supplemental event features 90 minutes of new trailers, interviews, and in-depth looks at the titles shown during the Xbox & Bethesda livestream. Xbox Wire describes the presentation as “all-new,” suggesting it may be more substantial than just a rehash of the June 12 event with a few extra tidbits.   
We don’t know what the Xbox & Bethesda showcase has in store, but appearances from Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8, and Redfall seem like solid guesses. You can listen to some of our Game Informer editors pit their predictions against each other in this episode of the Game Informer Show. 
To learn more about what’s happening and when during Summer Game Fest, keep an eye on our evolving showcase streaming schedule.]]></summary>

Several hours after the exciting images had been circulating on the information superhighway, publisher Capcom took to Twitter to address the leak, hinting toward it in non-too-subtle fashion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month we broke some rather unusual news. Successful judgments against three pirate streaming sites required every ISP in the United States to implement blocking measures, so that no subscriber could access them. However, after winning the Holy Grail of anti-piracy measures, the plaintiffs have now asked the court to suspend enforcement against ISPs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a night of being offline following the Collision event, Fortnite is back, once again shaking up the norm with new biomes to explore, skins to unlock, and gameplay techniques to master. In the final moments of last night's event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season's battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.
Fortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin', and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you'll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.
The tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it's in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you'll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.
On the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.
We'll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin', but it's off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.
What did you think of the Collision event? And are you excited to jump into this new season? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Pokémon Go Fest, trainers! We have two long days of catching Pokémon in front of us. To be a part of this festival, you need to buy the ticket in the in-game item shop for $14.99.
As we complete research challenges that lead to a mythical encounter with Shaymin, we'll want to be on the lookout for three Pokémon who are leaving their regions and will only be here for the two days. Those Pokémon are: Tropius, Torkoal, and Galarian Mr. Mime. We'll need to use incense to lure all of them out when they appear in their habitats.
As the Fest unfolds, each hour brings a different habitat with different Pokémon to catch. Many can be the rare shiny variant. Here's what you will find in each, along with the shiny opportunities:
City:
Plains
Rain Forest
Tundra
Omanyte (shiny)
Swinub (shiny)
Wingull (shiny)
Meditite (shiny)
Wailmer (shiny)
Spheal (shiny)
Galarian Mr. Mime (MUST USE INCENSE, complete research task)
Piplup (shiny)
Vanillite
Cubchoo (shiny)
Bermite
Popplio
Costumed Pikachu (shiny, hard to find)
Galarian Darumaka (shiny)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.
Arriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.

        <updated>2022-06-03T22:27:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.
The humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.
In a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. "The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players." 
On Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed "super secret project." We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.]]></summary>

I scoured the internet for dinosaur titles that are in the works and found five that look promising. The last one on this list is something you can download right now. Here's what we can look forward to soon:


Jurassic Architect
. Jurassic Architect is currently in development for PC and looks incredibly ambitious, almost like a sci-fi and prehistoric Sim City. Sadly, no release date has been given.


Deathground


The Lost Wild


Paleo Pines


Dinosaur Fossil Hunter
If you are looking for something you can play on PC right now, Dinosaur Fossil Hunter was released last month, and offers a deep simulation where you are tasked to drive across open worlds to find fossil sites, and then use various gadgets to locate and dig for dinosaur bones. The collections you unearth can then be displayed in your own museum. You get to design all of the displays and arrange how the dinosaurs look.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil fans have had a lot to celebrate over the years. Biohazard and Village have brought the series back to its horror roots in unique ways. The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.


Alex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.
The boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.
Are you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

        <updated>2022-06-03T18:34:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. 
As we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. 
What do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

During yesterday’s State of Play showcase, Sony revealed Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered would be coming to PC on August 12. It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. 
Oddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  
The original story continues below...
Original story, 6/2/22:
Have you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. 
The remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.
That’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.
Want more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like clockwork, MLB The Show's arrival each spring always brings a familiar face. Ramone Russell has been there front and center to tell us what is new in each edition of this annualized series. Ramone is Sony Interactive Entertainment's product development communications and brand strategist, but I've always jokingly called him "the face of The Show."
In the years I've interviewed Ramone about The Show, I've learned he has an inspiring story to tell. People always ask me "How do I get into the video game industry?" and there's no easy answer to that. Everyone's journey will be different, but it always requires patience and a drive to make it. That drive is the backbone of Ramone's story. He knew he wanted to get into video games and sacrificed everything numerous times to get there. I rec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

Okay, I’ve never said that, but dangit, I wish I did because it looks like that’s precisely what Final Fantasy XVI is delivering. 
Yesterday, Square Enix released a new trailer during PlayStation’s State of Play showcase, and it was our biggest and longest look at FF XVI yet. This nearly three-minute trailer featured fresh details on this entry’s story, extended looks at combat and gameplay, and more. It also introduced us to several new characters that appear to be central to the narrative of FF XVI who can seemingly transform into, or at least embody, primals...or summons or gods or whatever you wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed its next miniature console, the Mega Drive Mini 2. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that it will include 50 games from both the Mega Drive and Mega Drive CD, including ports of arcade games and games Sega calls “mysterious new work.” Sega revealed this mini console during a special livestream in Japan today. It included news that the company will release the Mega Drive Mini 2 on Oct. 27 (in Japan) with a roughly $75 price tag. Sega has not confirmed a release outside of Japan, according to VGC. 

VGC reports that these are the confirmed games so far:
Bonanza Bros (Mega Drive)
Fantasy Zone (because Fantasy Zone never hit the Mega Drive, this version is a port based on Super Fantasy Zone)
Magical Taruruto (Mega Drive)
Shining in the Darkness (Mega Drive)
Thunder Force IV (Mega Drive)
Virtua Racing (Mega Drive)
Mansion of Hidden Souls (Mega CD)
Popful Mail (Mega CD)
Shining Force CD (Mega CD)
Silpheed (Mega CD)
Sonic CD (Mega CD)
The Mega Drive Mini 2 follows 2019’s Mega Drive Mini, first announced in 2018. You can read our thoughts on it in the Game Informer Sega Mega Drive Mini review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have Final Fantasy XVI on the brain if you’re anything like me. This game, which Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III studio is developing, has admittedly been on my mind since Square Enix revealed it in 2020. However, it’s especially front and center today after the FF XVI trailer that aired during yesterday’s State of Play. 
That trailer featured new looks at gameplay, more information about the warring kingdoms, including the Empire, surrounding the story, and the key figures at the heart of it all. Yesterday’s trailer highlighted these characters because they seem to have the ability to transform into completely, or at least embody, the primals or summons seen throughout the Final Fantasy franchise – primals and summons such as Ifrit, Bahamut, Odin, Shiva, and more. Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: 

As you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting. These screenshots shed new light on the setting, though, including multiple locales we’ll likely be visiting when the game is released next summer. 
For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

It also gave us extended looks at gameplay and a summer 2023 release window, which might come as a surprise considering producer Naoki Yoshida said in April that FF XVI was near the end of development. The trailer, which dove deep into the story of FF XVI, focuses on the war that will soon be waged between warring kingdoms, with the Empire seemingly leading the charge. At the heart of this war are multiple key figures who appear to have the ability to transform into (or at least embody) primals, which have traditionally been summons in Final Fantasy games.
Check them out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Here are the primals/summons seen in the trailer: 
Phoenix
Titan
Garuda
Bamuh
Shiva
Odin
Bahamut
Ifrit
Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at the game's combat, which seems to contain some unique boss fights that will feature health bars on the top of the screen. The combat throughout the gameplay looks quite flashy, too, with plenty of spin attacks, fire, and more. At the bottom right is a weapon wheel of sorts that seems to be something players can customize, complete with items, a jump action, an attack action, and a slew of magic attacks to utilize. Hopefully we learn more about all of this soon!
Final Fantasy XVI is being developed by Square Enix's Creative Business Unit III's studio, and it will be released in the summer of 2023. For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.


Season won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when "the season" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.
As the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:
The title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's State of Play debuted a quirky dating-action game called Eternights. In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  
The game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.
Studio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. 
So get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.]]></summary>

Not only did the next installment of the legendary fighting game franchise make an appearance, but there was plenty of in-game footage shown, along with a second trailer showing a revolutionary new feature. 
First, the footage shown in the State of Play introduced a new single-player mode for SF6 called World Tour, which has players roaming the streets in an open world picking fights with other world warriors. The other is Battle Hub which is where players can throw down in matches online. Capcom states the mode will "further expand the scope of player communication and engagement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought football (both types) would continue being popular in the year 2030, you are apparently wrong. A new bloodsport called rollerdrome will apparently become all the rage in that year. Rollerdrome is in development at Roll7, the studio behind the OlliOlli series, and will be published by Private Division on August 16 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.
Anyone can compete in this deadly game, but the deck is stacked against them, as they take on house players (much like the American Gladiators show). The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.
“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Stray, the adorable cat game first revealed in 2020, was released during today's PlayStation State of Play and it featured new looks at gameplay and the exciting news that we can play it next month. 
That's because Stray will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 19. As for the trailer, it showcased more of the behind-the-cat, third-person (err, third-feline?) gameplay central to the game. As previously seen, this stray cat inhabits a very cyberpunk-esque world, filled with robots and more. As for the titular stray cat's place in all this, it seems they're on a mission to help inhabitants of this world and ultimately, find a way home. 
You can watch the trailer for yourself below: 


Here's what publisher Annapurna Interactive has to say about Stray: "In Stray, players take the role of a stray cat who must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out."

        <updated>2022-06-02T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play is bringing an array of exciting projects that are on deck for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and the upcoming PlayStation VR 2, but few are as anticipated as Callisto Protocol, the upcoming horror game from Striking Distance Studios. The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.
For those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.
In the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  
Jacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don't always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.
The Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.
In the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol's release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic is finally making its way to Sony's machines. Announced Thursday during the most recent State of Play livestream, the indie darling will be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 27 of this year. 
When it was released on Xbox consoles and PC back in March, Tunic received near-unanimous acclaim from critics, who most often cited its Zelda-like exploration and Souls-like combat. It didn't hurt that the game, which stars a little fox on a big adventure, was painfully adorable. As we said in our review, "Tunic is a stunning achievement that manages to embody the best of nostalgia while being completely refreshing. It’s absolutely a must-play gem."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony opened Thursday's State of Play livestream by announcing the long-rumored, often-leaked Resident Evil 4 Remake. While the brief trailer didn't show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.
Most strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game's story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. 
The trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. 
See the trailer in full below.


This is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you're being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you're being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of. Last year, Capcom partnered with developer Armature Studios on the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Horizon Forbidden West update was surprise announced during today's PlayStation State of Play stream and it's out now. 
It brings many new highly requested features to the game, including New Game+, transmog, and more. More specifically, this update, which can be downloaded now, will allow players to begin a brand new game with all of their endgame gear. If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. 


Elsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That's going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. 
Guerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today's update includes "improved visual fidelity." There's no word on exactly what that addresses but it's probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update. Finally, the last thing in today's update is the inclusion of new weapons to find and new trophies to obtain. 


Horizon Forbidden West is out now exclusively on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and today's surprise update can be downloaded right now. While waiting for it to download, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out this adorable Aloy nendoroid figure.

Find out why the machines are attacking." Today's Sony State of Play brought fans another look at Guerrilla Games' VR adventure, Horizon Call of the Mountain, though the trailer didn't specify a release window. However, it did reveal some of the game's big narrative plot points. The trailer, which you can watch below, was also filled with lush environments and showed off several impressive, first-person shots of the world's monstrous machines.


You'll be playing as Ryas, an entirely new character, who was once a Shadow Carja. He finds himself mysteriously released from prison by Blameless Marad, the Sun King's right-hand man, to combat a deadly threat. Skilled at climbing and archery, Ryas ends up washed ashore after a Snapmaw attacks his two captors. The wild rapids look like they'll be an experience in the PSVR2 game's campaign, but players can check out even more rushing waters in the Call of the Mountain River Ride. This bonus feature offers to show you Horizon's world in a totally new way. 
A post on PlayStation's blog offered more insight for players who are ready to jump into the Ryas' story, saying:

A few of these reveals are games designed exclusively for the forthcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. We still haven't gotten our hands on this highly anticipated device, and today Sony made the wait for this moment all the more difficult with the announcement that Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution, and No Man's Sky are all in development for it.
The footage for Resident Evil Village doesn't make the experience look much different, as it was already first person, but if it's anything like the other Resident Evil experiences, the headset will up the terror and immersion.


The Walking Dead gave us glimpses of using a chainsaw against zombie hordes, as well as other sharp instruments and firearms. Skydance Interactive and Skybound Entertainment say the game is slated to release in late 2022 for PSVR2.


No Man's Sky looks absolutely stunning, but we'll have to wait to get our hands on it to see if it's any different than the PC version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World opened in Universal Studios Japan last year, and word of mouth (and various YouTube videos featuring walkthroughs and more) says it’s a great theme park addition. Universal is clearly a fan of it because Super Nintendo World expansions have received the greelight at both Universal Studios Hollywood and at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida. 
Now, we know the first Super Nintendo World in the U.S. will open in early 2023 in Hollywood. This news comes by way of the official Universal Studios Hollywood Twitter account, which revealed the early 2023 timeframe today alongside a picture that reveals Mario is no longer the short king he’s always been. Instead, he has extra long legs that – I’m going to be honest – ain’t right. Luigi is the tall one, Universal! Not Mario!!
Get ready, #SuperNintendoWorld is coming to Universal Studios Hollywood in early 2023. pic.twitter.com/pCYaeHgWsq
June 2, 2022
This Twitter account also posted a quick teaser of the Mario Kart ride that will be at Super Nintendo World when it opens next year, and it looks amazing. It features not just traditional animatronics and in-ride sculptures but digital elements, too, in the form of screens and some kind of special glasses. Universal says we’ll be able to “ride through iconic courses, throw shells, and collect coins to beat Team Bowser” in the ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The season of game announcements is finally here, and it's Sony kicking off the fun as one of the biggest publishers in the world is taking the digital stage to show off what's coming to PlayStation platforms. Join Game Informer as we react live to everything shown during this State of Play presentation live on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Your host for today's exciting show is the one and only Alex Stadnik. The big man will kick off the proceedings live starting at 4:45 p.m. CT for a little preshow where he'll give you some predictions and bring the hype. But what can people expect from today's State of Play? According to the official PlayStation Blog, fans can look forward to: "exciting reveals from our third-party partners, plus a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation VR2." We know one of those games is Horizon Call of the Mountain, developer Guerrilla Games' and Firesprite's collaboration featuring one of Sony's biggest franchises.
We know PSVR2 will be featured, but what else can fans look forward to? With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance? Did I just jinx us, and now we're not getting anything listed in this article? Only time will tell, but that's why you have to tune in later today.
Thank you so much for watching. If you enjoy our watch-along streams, be sure to subscribe to our Twitch pages to get notified the second we go live and to get access to our tremendous exclusive Discord.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-02T17:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No longer shall it be called Dragon Age 4, as developer BioWare has revealed a new name for the upcoming RPG that will henceforth be known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
A blog post announcing the title also goes into one possible meaning behind it. It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being "an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games."
Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.]]></summary>

Starting tomorrow, a new patch will be applied to the fighting game that will add balance changes to the roster, but more importantly, also add new mechanics to the game.
Patch 2.80 for Granblue Fantasy Versus is ushering in three new mechanics that will undoubtedly change the game in massive ways. First is Rush, a tactical move that dashes the character forward to quickly close the distance on the opponent and strike when they least expect it. Similarly, Backshift is a dash backward that allows for a quick escape from pressure or a dodge to use in dicey situations, like back-dashing on wakeup to foil the opposition's advanc…]]></summary>

Games should stay in games.

As such, we have our first look at the PS Plus launch lineup of games ranging from PlayStation 5 to the first PlayStation, and even PlayStation Portable too, courtesy of Gematsu.
Of course, it’s important to note that since this is the lineup of games available today in Japan, there’s the possibility this lineup could be just for Japan. The U.S. lineup, which launches on June 13, for example, could be completely different. Only time will tell. However, the Japan lineup could, at the very least, be a great indication of what’s to come. 
Here’s the launch lineup of Plus games in Japan, broken up by platform:

With this year paying tribute to the late John Madden through three special covers, EA Sports wants to deliver a product worthy of putting his face back on the main cover for the first time in more than 20 years. I spent a day in EA Orlando's offices to learn how this year's game pushes the series forward and applies lessons learned from previous years to deliver several key improvements in this year's product.

I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That's how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring's major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.

Then, I was happy to announce that this rapid 1TB PCIe 4.0 drive had made it to £100 - a price it's gotten near a few times before but not stayed at with any regularity. You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I discovered that Crucial are now selling the same drive at their site for £80.69 - a genuine bargain and the lowest price we've ever seen by some margin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s officially summer, although you wouldn’t think it based on the amount of rain we’ve had up here in Newcastle this week. Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen motherboards are getting cheaper, which is handy if you're planning a new build around one of Intel's excellent 12100, 12400F or 12600F CPUs for gaming. One of the best deals we've spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You're missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

Now developers SCS Software say that they've decided not to release the expansion, "so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

It's a bold play releasing a Soulslike in any year, let alone the year of Elden Ring. You could snap open any twelve month span like a bulrush and watch many thousands of little Soulslikes disperse into the atmosphere, with only a select few really making an impact.
Steelrising is one of these Soulslike seeds hoping to sink into our screens, sprout, and take root not only in the innards of our Panasonics, but our minds too. From what I've seen, it stands a chance of survival in a saturated land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word that comes to mind is "slick". In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

In a moment of high folly, perhaps hubris, Unexplored 2 has arrived to these lands to preach the benefits of novelty and moreish dungeon delving. This is a chonker of a roguelike RPG, in which long-held assumptions about how the genre ought to be designed are thrown away, while others are strictly obeyed. The designers of this colourful 'splorer have rubbed their chins and decided to see what our beloved randomly generated death tales would look like without two sacred cows: money and meters. Folks, it looks kinda good.

Ne'er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it's our favourite video games that made big swings but didn't quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling "jurassic" properly first time; I've never been able too. 
Diversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is "about as big as an Alsatian" and "basically a bin-bag full of girders". So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.

Sounds like my freshman year!" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, "You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
