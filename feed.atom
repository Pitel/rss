Released during a special San Diego Comic Con panel about the game, this trailer features plenty of Peter Parker, Miles Morales, MJ, Kraven, a dose of the Lizard, lots of symbiotic action, and of course, Venom. While the last showing of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 focused on gameplay, today’s is all about the narrative, and it seems to be teasing who our Venom might be. 
Check it out for yourself below in the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 story trailer: 


As you can see, this trailer gives us our first look at Harry Osborn (outside of the floating green liquid we presumably last saw him in), another look at Hunter and the Lizard, and a heaping of Venom, and all of it looks like a great time. The …]]></summary>

Developers DECK13 have released a new trailer for their upcoming fantasy action RPG Atlas Fallen that primarily highlights its combat. And, I have to admit, it looks very impressive! The battles looks fast-paced and reminds me a lot of the combat in Monster Hunter. I'd say maybe even with a mix of God of War thrown in.
You can target specific body parts on larger enemies like their legs and feet in an effort to incapacitate them and cause them to fall to the ground. Also similar to Monster Hunter, breaking certain body parts can result in unique resources unlocking special crafting options. Here's the combat trailer for Atlas Fallen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQfhGubWns
In Atlas Fallen, you can have two main weapons equipped at the same time and switch between them to unleash a variety of combos. Throughout the video, we see several weapons with varying styles including a cleaver, whip, and even fist weapons. You evade attacks by rolling and dashing and can even jump high into the air to keep the pressure on bigger enemies.
You also build momentum with each successful attack. Momentum grants you the ability to use special attacks and also empowers your weapon. However, the more momentum you have, the more damage you will take the next time you are hit. I'm excited to see how this risk vs. reward system actually feels in combat.
The trailer also confirmed that Atlas Fallen will be fully playable via online two-player co-op. The entire campaign can be completed with a friend, which will definitely be fun with this style of combat. I always enjoyed teaming up with friends to take down a particularly pesky beast in Monster Hunter.
Atlas Fallen releases on August 10 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks pretty boss
Lilycore Games has dropped their lesbian boss rush game, Bossgame: The Final Boss Is My Heart today on Steam and itch.io. Previously, it was only available on mobile.
Yes, its aesthetics have some clear Undertale vibes with its minimalistic high-contrast colors. However, it’s pretty unique in its story about broke lesbian partners fighting devils in the streets. Meanwhile, you get to flirt between battles and confront your employer. Sounds real feel-good.
https://youtu.be/EMkf1gLQzLM
Bossgame: The Final Boss Is My Heart is a rhythmic boss rush where the two lovers work together to take down baddies. Between them, you can build up combos, and if one goes down, the other can revive her. The narrative is provided through today’s most fashionable way of socializing: text.
While it doesn’t look like the most extensive or high-concept game, Bossgame: The Final Boss Is My Heart looks like a fun time. As a violent pansexual, I’m always down for indulging my lesbian side, especially in the realm of gaming. It doesn’t come up all that frequently, for some reason. It’s almost like video game relationships, straight or queer, often only exist so someone can die and drive the survivor to a path of revenge. Our action-focused media sure has a strange approach to human romance.
Bossgame: The Final Boss Is My Heart is available today on PC, and can also be found on mobile platforms.

Some of today's video games far surpass the most successful movie blockbusters in terms of writing. That hasn't always been the case, however. You probably know that, as movie fans who don't care for games have never missed a chance to slam the medium's once rather generalized shortcomings in terms of writing prowess. Still, that didn't prevent video games from coming up with some — sometimes accidental — short literary masterpieces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's with umbrellas this year?
ININ has announced that they’re bringing Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3 to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch consoles this year.
Parasol Stars was the follow-up to Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2. While those two games were released in arcade and ported to consoles, Parasol Stars skipped the first step and went straight to consoles. In North America, we only got the Turbografx-16 version, but in other parts of the world, it also landed on the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, and Atari ST platforms. So, it’s a bit of an obscure title.
https://youtu.be/Fhc73Q7Dkb0
Parasol Stars once again stars brothers Bub and Bob in their rotund human forms. This time, they’re equipped with magical umbrellas and travel from planet to planet, saving them from evil. It’s a pretty odd plot, but it’s not like the series ongoing narrative was ever really that sane.
It’s a bit unclear about what is going to be included beyond a port of the Turbografx/PC-Engine version. That’s exciting in its own right, as it’s a game that has been out of print for decades now. There’s no word on if the NES and Game Boy ports will be included. However, both the press release and trailer coyly suggest another announcement with “More parasols coming.” A full remaster? I don’t know, maybe. You now have all the information I do.
Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3 is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch near the end of 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us Part 1 is a brutal game that features a lot of murder and gore. But because the game is played from a third-person perspective, there is a bit of distance between players and its intense action. But that distance disappears when the game is modded into an action-packed first-person shooter.

Krillbite Studio, the people behind Among the Sleep and Mosaic, have announced their next game. It’s Fruitbus, and it’s here to fill the massive, truck-sized hole in my heart.
I really need this after the colossal disappointment that was Food Truck Simulator. I’m still not over that. Fruitbus is generally a similar concept, except all your food is vegan, and you serve it to animals. You get to explore an open world in the eponymous food service vehicle and gather ingredients to feed to all the folks.
https://youtu.be/YOK-vXFoDOs
The trailer shows off a wide variety of activities, customization, and faces to stuff with food. Listen, this is going to sound really weird, but seeing that you have to pull the parking brake is really exciting to me. It’s the small touches that connect you to a game’s world, and you should never count out the mundane tactile tasks as an effective way to draw you in.
That’s about all the information we have here. I mean, really, they had me at parking brake. I don’t want to get my hopes up too much about Fruitbus. However, it looks like it ticks a lot of my extremely specific boxes. I was really excited for Food Truck Simulator, but it failed to deliver. Hopefully, what it really needed was some smoothies and the hungry faces of crowds of furries.
Unfortunately, I’ll be waiting until 2024 to play Fruitbus. It’s coming to PC and “consoles.”

        <updated>2023-07-20T19:00:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been making tracks
Konami has announced that their 2020 game, Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban, has passed 4 million units sold. What’s important about that? Well, a few things.
Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban has never been released outside of Japan. That’s not entirely surprising, as Momotaro Dentetsu is a long-running series that started back on the Famicom back in 1988. Back then, it was produced by Hudson Soft, but after Hudson went bust, all its assets were bought out by Konami in 2012. However, in all that time, Momotaro Dentetsu has never been localized. Not one game. It has always stayed in Japan.
[caption id="attachment_392615" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Konami[/caption]
Furthermore, 4 million sales in Japan is a crazy number. To put this into perspective, Famitsu reported last month that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has a lifetime sales number of 2,208,705. It’s not quite the numbers of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (5,211,237) or Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (5,328,989) and not even close to touching Animal Crossing New Horizons (7,477,507). Still, for a non-first-party Switch exclusive, it’s a rather insane number.
So, does this mean we’ll see it over here? Failing that, will the West get the upcoming Momotaro Dentetsu World: Chikyuu wa Kibou de Mawatteru!? It’s not impossible, but I wouldn’t exactly count on it. The Momotaro Dentetsu games are steeped in Japanese culture. They’re in the style of board games, and are largely about traveling Japan’s legendary rail system to buy up as much of it as possible. It’s sort of like Monopoly but for public transportation.
The point is, I found this very fascinating, and if you’re reading this paragraph, chances are you’ve fallen victim to my eclectic enthusiasm. You’re welcome or I’m sorry. Take your pick.

It's unfortunate that the gaming industry is rife with abuse and harassment. Whether it's workplace discrimination or hate speech online, there's no shortage of stories when it comes to toxicity. Sadly, indie developers are not immune to this either, as the project lead for the upcoming fan project Skyblivion says they've recently been receiving death threats.
In a post on Twitter, @Rebelzize says that working on the unofficial Oblivion remake has meant "dealing with stalking, death threads [sic], harassment," as well as hacking. An additional tweet goes on to say that the team has "already sacrificed so much" and that the project lead is working a full-time job while having to deal with this. At the time of writing, it's unclear why they've been the target of online abuse.
https://twitter.com/Rebelzize/status/1680929214944378880
As well as harassment and stalking, some "bits and bobs" were lost when the developer's Discord server was hacked. Fortunately, the server and "all other accounts" are now back, and it seems as though the upcoming project is still on target for a 2025 release.
What is Skyblivion?
For those who don't know, Skyblivion is an unofficial remake of the fourth Elder Scrolls game that's being rebuilt in Skyrim's engine. It's been in the pipeline for several years now, but recent updates from the team show that progress is coming along nicely, and it's looking pretty fabulous so far. The remake is said to be free, but you'll need legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (duh), as well as the expansion packs.
It's frustrating to see that people are still being subjected to online abuse, whether it's the players themselves or studios. There's no clear reason why @Rebelzize would be receiving death threats, but there are plenty of others who are cheering the project on, with the "good [outweighing] the bad 1,000 to 1."

Namco Bandai has dropped a story trailer for From Software’s upcoming Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. Let’s watch, shall we?
https://youtu.be/Vs2piSWfofQ
Was that really super quiet to you? I had to crank all my volume levers to actually make out what the grim, passionless voice was saying.
In any case, I suppose robots fighting a big tank is a type of story. I’m not sure what it tells me about the overarching narrative of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. I suppose it conveys all the important information: big robots, skate jets, lots of guns. Then there was a person under a tarp, with a big robot creepily watching them.
While I got my start with Armored Core on PS1, I fell off the series with Armored Core 4 on PS3. I played that game a long time ago, but I vividly remember getting screamed at constantly for leaving the combat area. It’s not like there were laser walls or some kind of marker to inform me where the combat area was. I’d just strafe off to the side, and suddenly someone was threatening to cut all my systems.
Still, I'm interested in playing Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon to make up for the fact that I haven’t played the series since. Hopefully, no one shouts at me in this one. Or, at the very least, I hope someone puts up a sign to tell me where the combat area ends.
Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is out on August 25, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Nintendo has today published the final part of its Ask the Developer interview series focused on Pikmin 4, and this one saw the development team open up about their personal thoughts on the franchise as a whole.
It should come as no surprise that Shigeru Miyamoto had some thoughts to share on his relationship to the Pikmin series — the games have long been considered something of a "favourite child" for the legendary designer, after all — and his answers did not disappoint. Speaking about what Pikmin means to him, Miyamoto confessed that he considers the adorable plant species to be "Nintendo's most global characters" and he wants players to have a real sense that the creatures could exist in the everyday world:

It may have been a huge, bug-ridden let-down when The Last of Us Part 1 released on PC, but a series of patches is aiming to fix the biggest problems. And it's not just Naughty Dog that's tinkering with the remake, either. One modder has been looking to implement a first-person mode for the game, and a recent video shows off this work-in-progress.
Visual artist and YouTuber Bryan Ortiz (aka Voyagers Revenge) has uploaded some footage from their first-person modification of The Last of Us Part I on PC. Specifically, the video shows the "brutal combat and new aggressive gameplay." Over the course of nearly nine minutes, you'll get to see the crumbled world of Part I from the perspective of Joel, as he fights off both the infected and attacking gangs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhTdX-3Hvc
When will we get to play it?
Unfortunately, this mod is not currently available, and is still being worked on by Ortiz. In response to a comment that asked whether this first-person mode will become available, Voyagers Revenge says it's currently unstable. It's also been built for an early version of the game, and is "crashing the game multiple times." However, they did say they'll "pull some strings soon," so it's possible they may look to releasing the mod at some point.
When it came out earlier this year, the PC version of the Last of Us remake was panned due to a laundry list of technical issues. It was a shame, really, as for many PC users, it was the first time they'd had a chance to check out Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed game. However, the updates must be doing the trick, as recent scores on Steam show that Part I is now sitting at "Very Positive," though still "Mixed" overall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The charm set is 500 Platinum, the towel is 600
Pikmin 4 is hitting the Switch, and Nintendo is celebrating in all sorts of ways. They've marketed this one more than any other entry before it, and they're not done yet! Hot off of the My Nintendo shop is a new product: shoe charms. This is in addition to the prior sticker reward.
Nintendo usually provides some stats or info for My Nintendo drops, but not this time! The shoe charms are pretty much as advertised: it's a trio of charms that you can put on footwear to stand out, and the set comes in a baggie with three characters (Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin). The charms themselves are rubber and have a small latch on the back. They're a bit like Croc's Jibbitz charms. It'll cost you 500 Platinum Points for the privilege, plus shipping. I got them for my daughter!
The other reward is a kitchen towel set for 600 Platinum Points. This one has some info: "Add a touch of Pikmin decor to your home with this microfiber kitchen towel! Decorated with a pattern of Red Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, and Ice Pikmin along with touches of greenery, this absorbent towel makes for an easy and fun way to carry off minor spills." It's 24" x 18" and is made of microfiber.

Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

        <updated>2023-07-20T16:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. 
Despite the "VI" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or "Raven" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. 


Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC. You can learn more by checking out our recent cover story.]]></summary>

Have you ever watched a heist movie and wished you were the one fleecing the wealthy casino owner? Or maybe you sat there facepalming, muttering that they wouldn’t have got away with it if you were in charge. Asym Altered Axis, available to demo as part of Steam Next Fest, will let you take on either role.

Asym Altered Axis is an asymmetric multiplayer game, billed as a blend of stealth CTF action and top-down tower defense. A team of up to five Infiltrators attempts to plunder the player’s base while the Protector floats above, reigning fire (and other attacks) on any interlopers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin will no longer come to Steam. Back in March, it was announced that the long-running emulator would get a surprise release on the storefront, but that was soon “indefinitely postponed” due to legal troubles with Nintendo and Valve. Now the team have cleared up the situation and are “abandoning” their efforts completely.


“First things first - Nintendo did not send Valve or Dolphin a [DMCA Takedown] notice against our Steam page,” the team clarified in a recent blog post, before adding that “Nintendo has not taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve.” 


What actually happened was a legal back and forth. Valve’s legal department had contacted Nintendo regarding the emulator’s Steam release. A lawyer representing Nintendo asked Valve to prevent it. And then Valve forwarded that statement to the Dolphin team, “and told us that we had to come to an agreement with Nintendo in order to release it on Steam.”

        <updated>2023-07-20T15:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.
The five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.


The video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. 
Atlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, let Capcom know your thoughts on the game
Whether we like it or love it, the video game industry is in something of a remake enlightenment of some kind. There are, of course, some fantastic remakes and remasters out there, one of which is Resident Evil 4. Not only a great game in its own right but a fantastic reimagining of what many consider to be one of the best horror titles in existence.
Since the remake was released in March of this year, Capcom's modern take on RE4 has been a rousing success. In fact, according to the developer, the game has now surpassed five million in sales. The press release on the company website says the Resident Evil 4 remake "provides both fans of the series and newcomers alike with a fresh gameplay experience."
https://youtu.be/Id2EaldBaWw
This latest milestone comes just shortly after it was announced that the game had sold four million units. To date, the Resident Evil series has sold around 142 million copies worldwide, going back to its first entry in 1996.
What's next?
Resident Evil 4 may be the latest in a list of remakes Capcom is doing, but is it the last? In June, the studio asked what RE fans wanted to see next, and whether anyone was interested in even more remakes. On top of that, a recent shareholder meeting suggested the developer was not necessarily saying no to remaking spin-off Resident Evil games. Then again, they weren't saying yes either, so it's still up in the air.
Of course, we can't say for certain what's in store. We're pretty confident in saying that RE9 is probably imminent (though we don't have full confirmation on that yet), and it's possible that Capcom may want to do more reimaginings in the future. A lot of fans would probably like to see an official remake of Code Veronica, for example.
In the meantime, you can let the developer know what you thought of Resident Evil 4 by taking this questionnaire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought Exoprimal somehow managed to make dinosaurs versus mechs, aka the coolest concept ever, boring in my review-in-progress. I held out hope it would improve, though, as lots of commenters assured me it's fun side would finally surface. "Just play several more hours and things really open up! Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.
But the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.

Meanwhile with Ampere Altra Max and AmpereOne there is no SMT and it's likely Intel's upcoming Sierra Forest will also lack SMT (Hyper Threading) given it's an E-core-only design. But that led to my curiosity over the SMT impact for Bergamo on power and performance when leveraging SMT for the 128-core flagship EPYC 9754. Today's Bergamo benchmarking is looking at SMT on and off for both 1P and 2P server configurations.]]></summary>

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and this week sees The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom once again manage to cling onto the top spot despite some fresh competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gundam Evolution, the competitive multiplayer title set within the popular Gundam universe, is shutting down.
Despite launching less than a year ago in September 2022, executive producer Kazuya Maruyama shared in a blog post that support for the game will be winding down, though he doesn't provide any specifics as to why.  
“We wanted to create a title that brought FPS fans and Gundam fans together," Maruyama writes. "We challenged ourselves to create an authentic Gundam FPS game that could be played globally. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is no longer possible for us to provide a service that satisfies our players.”
A livestream detailing the sunsetting roadmap will air tomorrow, July 21 at 11 p.m. PT. Gundam Evolution’s services officially end on November 29. Until then, Maruyama states that it will still receive updates. Season 6 arrives on August 23, and the final season hits on October 25. Both seasons will introduce a new unit and maps. 
Today, the following services will be suspended:
Ending sales of EVO Coins
Ending sales of EC Pod Limited
Ending updates to EC Pods, CAP Pods, and Ticket Pods
Gundam Evolution was announced at a PlayStation State of Play in March 2022. The FPS title lets players suit up as their favorite mobile suits to battle in 6v6 matches across various game modes. Unfortunately, it now joins the growing list of multiplayer titles that closed their doors this year, which includes Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Babylon's Fall, Rumbleverse, Apex Legends Mobile, and Knockout City.]]></summary>

The souls-like genre has become extremely prevalent in recent years. Despite the increased popularity, few games have been able to pull off the formula and stand toe-to-toe with Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne. Remnant: From the Ashes had a rather modest launch back in 2019, but in the years following acquired somewhat of a cult following. I loved the original, but definitely felt it had room for improvement. Thankfully, Remnant 2 improves on what made Remnant so much fun, while also fixing some of the more glaring flaws.
Oh yeah, and also like the original, Remnant 2 is hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a kinda magic.
The Might and Magic series is about as ‘old-school RPG’ as it gets—it’s been around since the distant, ancient days of the 1980s. As the series has changed hands a couple of times over the decades, plenty of spin-offs have been generated, with Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes being the one Nintendo fans are likely most aware of. As part of the then-new Ubisoft continuity, this DS project aimed to broaden the fanbase by going with an action puzzler gameplay design that would be generally more approachable and fit comfortably on the humble hardware. Now, a decade on, it has been revived as Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes – Definitive Edition by none other than developer and publisher Dotemu, of Streets of Rage 4 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge fame. Though not much has changed here since its introduction, this Definitive Edition nonetheless shows that this was always a solid and enjoyable puzzler that stands as a welcome addition to the Switch library.
Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is set in the magical world of Ashan, taking place in the Ubisoft timeline a few decades before Heroes of Might and Magic V. The story kicks off with you playing as Anwen, a young elf girl who is quickly orphaned when a sudden demon attack plunges her camp into chaos. The demons are after a mythical artifact called the Blade of Binding (no, not that one) which could open a portal to the demon realm and kick off a full-scale war in Ashan if the demons got their hands on it. Thirsty for revenge and desperate to avert the impending conflict, Anwen sets out on a fraught race against time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes was one of those Nintendo DS games that I never played at the time but had always heard was very good. Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love. Because it really is very hard, and I still can't quite decide if I'm having fun or not.

Then again, given the mild horror themes in many of the levels and the general terror the excellent enemy design invokes, you probably shouldn’t be playing it around kids in the first place. As a fan of this sequel’s predecessor, Remnant: From The Ashes, I had my hopes set unreasonably high, and not only has Remnant II completely met my expectations, but it also kept messing around with what I thought I should be expecting. It left me in a constant state of awe. This is a furiously ambitious follow-up and has everything I could have ever wanted.

From Software knows what they're doing at this point when it comes to flashy character designs. They've seen the memes, the fanart, and the fanfare from all sorts of creations; with the trend arguably popping off with Solaire of Astora, aka the "Praise the Sun Guy." Well, Elden Ring added a ton of characters to the pile, including the Turtle Pope.
Yep, toy and statue purveyor Youtooz has an officially licensed plushy on the way of a fan-favorite NPC. Youtooz notes that this particular release is 9 inches tall, and is modeled after Miriel, Pastor of Vows, also known as "the Turtle Pope" from Elden Ring. It's priced at $29.99, and it'll ship sometime within a window of September 9 through October 9 (for the US and Canada only).
Here's the full product description:
"Miriel, Pastor of Vows arrives at Youtooz to give us all their blessings! At 9 inches tall his large green and brown shell protects the soft, yet incredibly sturdy, scaled brown body that emerges from its safety! His legs and head extend outward with a gentle smile as a white mitre sits atop their head, its gold embellishments shining as brightly as the Erdtee’s light! This plush is packed to the seams with 100% PP cotton and is made of normal minky, sublimated minky and shiny materials, absolutely perfect for cuddling or teaching you the wildest sorceries and incantations!"

While I'm holding off on getting a Turtle Pope of my own, if my daughter was old enough to play Elden Ring and liked it, I couldn't resist. This is a really clever pull!

To the delight of many Nintendo has been pulling back hard requirements for amiibo unlocks, so there is another way: to acquire them in-game, you'll need to head to the Llyn Nyddwr Camp in the Fornis region and speak to the Nopon Miibomii.
The new amiibo additions are the main event, but there are also a few bug fixes for the recent Future Redeemed DLC. You can check out the full patch notes below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 will make a big appearance at San Diego Comic Con this year.
Mortal Kombat creator and director of MK1, Ed Boon, tweeted yesterday what fans can expect at the SDCC panel, “Resetting Mortal Kombat: A New Beginning With Mortal Kombat 1,” tomorrow, and it’s going to be perhaps the most significant drop of new information we’ve received for the game yet. Boon says MK1 voice actors will be there alongside NetherRealm Studios developers to tell the “making of” story of the game. Plus, there will be three new MK1 trailers during the panel, including gameplay and a “surprise.” 
Mortal Kombat fans at San Diego Comic-Con. Wanna see a TON of new #MortalKombat1 stuffs?

July 20, 2023
As for when, the “Resetting Mortal Kombat” SDCC panel begins tomorrow, July  21, at 3:15 p.m. PT and lasts one full hour, ending at 4:15 p.m. PT. If you’re ready for new Mortal Kombat 1 footage, be sure to tune in!
MK1 was announced two months ago with a teaser trailer indicating the wider Mortal Kombat universe has been completely reset (hence the “1” in the title). The following month, in June, NetherRealm released our first look at MK1 gameplay with a trailer that featured new looks at the roster, story details, the reveal of Kameo fighters, and more. 
During Summer Game Fest, we went hands-on with it that same month and had a blast with the Kameo fighters and gory and fun fighting action. You can check out some of that action in our MK1 New Gameplay Today here. 
The latest news NetherRealm released about MK1 was a trailer earlier this month revealing Smoke and Rain in the game’s fighter roster. And tomorrow, we’ll receive more information, including three trailers. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.
Are you tuning in tomorrow to learn more about Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Reading through the reviews for Pikmin 4 yesterday, one thing became abundantly clear: this game is big. You could play through the original Pikmin in a swift couple of hours, and even Pikmin 3 didn't pack the longest playtime out there, but we specifically mentioned the "hefty 30+ hour running time" in our review, and we were not alone.
This makes it all the more impressive that in Nintendo's recent Ask the Developer interview series, Pikmin 4's director, Yuji Kando, confessed to having played through the main story mode "around 20 times" in order to iron out any bugs.

In our own review here on Nintendo Life, we awarded the latest chapter in the series nine out of ten stars and praised it as a "sumptuous strategy adventure". Pikmin 4 also seems to have been just as well-received by other games outlets - with a number of sites awarding it top marks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My battle against autocorrect begins
Oxeliz has announced that their space colony builder, Quriocity, will be leaving Early Access on July 25. This completes its growth into a full version that began back in October, 2022.
Quriocity places you in the role of a leader of a space colony. Humans have developed faster-than-light travel, and it’s time to put roots down on new planets. More than just advancing and building up your space empire, you need to ensure that your colonists are comfortable this far out from humanity’s cradle. Beyond that, new settlers will be arriving on your space paradise, and you’ll need to be ready to accommodate them.
https://youtu.be/ZKFXhdivf64
The update that is coming with Quriocity’s release is a hefty one. It includes 5 new maps, seasonal and dynamic weather, and 48 unique campaigns. Considering the complaint that I often see leveled at Quriocity’s current state is a lack of content, this will probably be enough to satisfy that hunger. The developers state that this patch is the result of community feedback.
I’ve bounced off a fair few space city builders over the years. I’m not sure I have the time to jump into Quriocity right away, but I’ll have it earmarked to check in the future. I always find that games of this very particular sub-genre have a certain sterility to them. I’m sort of seeing that same problem here, but with the addition of foliage and dynamic weather, it might break the mold.
Quriocity is currently available via Steam Early Access, with the full version dropping on July 25, 2023.

This news arrives the same day Activision Blizzard released its Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 results, which highlights a murky future for the company’s esports efforts despite an otherwise financially successful quarter for the Overwatch 2 maker. Activision Blizzard’s results show that net bookings grew 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, from $1.64 billion to $2.46 billion, due to a lucrative Diablo IV launch, an increase in revenue from various franchises, mobile growth, and more. But, despite that growth, the company laid off around 50 employees in Blizzard’s esports department, Activision Blizzard esports senior director of global communication Brad Crawford confirmed to Game Informer.

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. 
Enjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: 


Ubisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. 
In our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. 
For more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. 
The Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.

Blizzard is bridging the gap and bringing some of its PC games over to Steam. The publisher announced that select games will appear on Valve's launcher, starting with Overwatch 2 hitting Steam on August 10.
The free-to-play team shooter will launch with a few Steam tie-ins. Namely, there will be some Steam Achievements and the ability to invite Steam friends into matches. Players on Steam can also match and play against Battle.net users too, in case you were worried about that. You will, however, still need a Battle.net account to play Overwatch 2.
Overwatch 2's Steam launch also coincides with the release of Invasion, the seasonal update that will add Blizzard's pared-down and reduced PvE plans.

A little over two years later, the Max Payne-styled vampire-slaying slo-mo-shooter continues to look incredibly stylish as it drops its release date alongside an AMV for one of its hip-hop OST’s original tracks.

Check your watches, it’s summer! And now it’s time for the PlayStation Summer Sale. It’s your chance to pick up those games that you kind of wanted, but definitely not at full price. The sale ends on August 16th.
Or maybe you just overlooked a title that wound up being a sleeper hit. Now’s a good time to circle back to it and check it out. Like, maybe you’d like to try Destructoid’s 2021 Game of the Year, Chicory: A Colorful Tale. It’s the game that Destructoid’s own Zoey “FIO!” Handley said is “going to make you breakfast and leave you to clean up the mess.” Whatever that means.
Or perhaps you somehow missed out on Destructoid’s 2022 Game of the Year, Elden Ring. This is the game that Destructoid’s own Chris “MARCO!” Carter said was “possibly my favorite From Software game yet.” High praise from our Player 1. I think the sale price is worth it just to check out the hunky Blaidd the Half Wolf.
I’ve got bad news for you, though. None of the Metal Slug games are on sale. Not one. As a way of drying your tears, here’s a handful of games I found while skimming through the sales.
Tactics Ogre: Reborn $29.99
Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition $15.99
LEGO CITY Undercover $5.99
Like a Dragon: Ishin! $38.99
Guilty Gear Strive $29.99
Overcooked! All You Can Eat $17.99
Mafia: Definitive Edition $13.99
Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart $29.39
Resident Evil Village $19.99
Red Dead Redemption 2 $19.79
Chicory: A Colorful Tale $13.99
Wanted: Dead $29.99
FATAL FRAME: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse $37.49
Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection $14.99
Elden Ring $41.99
Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium Bundle $19.99
Hopefully, that will keep you from going outside. There are people out there. If that’s not enough, you can check out the full list over here on the PlayStation Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We'll never let go.
Whenever Nintendo brings a franchise back from the brink of extinction, it's always cause for significant celebration. Take Pikmin, for example: yes, it's hardly the most obvious example since we received Hey! Pikmin in 2017, but it's been over a decade since Pikmin 3 launched on the Wii U. Despite the ongoing rumours and hints regarding what would eventually become Pikmin 4, many of us had simply accepted that maybe, just maybe, the mainline franchise would remain indefinitely dormant
Thankfully, this wasn't the case, and Pikmin 4 is just about ready for its grand debut on the Switch. It's not alone either. For a good while, it was feared that even Metroid would become lost to the Nintendo archives, but with the successful launch of both Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered on the Switch, you could argue that the franchise has never been healthier.

This is the lowest price we've spotted for AMD's fastest GPU since it launched last year and a great deal for a card that originally retailed for north of £999. 
This particular model is the Asus Tuf Gaming OC design, which has been well-rated for its thermal efficiency and performance. However, this is a big card, so it's worth checking its dimensions (352.9 x 158.2 x 72.6mm) versus your case to ensure that it will fit, especially in smaller Micro ATX or Mini ATX enclosures.

The Crew, Ubisoft’s racing franchise akin to Microsoft’s Forza series and EA’s Need For Speed, has been around for nearly a decade. And since its inception, it has struggled to make a cultural dent in the racing genre, despite sales greenlighting a sequel and, now, a threequel in The Crew Motorfest. I went into a four-hour, hands-on remote preview of Motorfest, hoping to feel something different about this series. But, like The Crew 2 and The Crew before it, Motorfest feels uninspired, even if still a competent racer.

Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are pushing back a notable deadline in the ongoing merger talks. Originally set for July 18, the merger agreement deadline for the companies has now been pushed out to October 18.
This extension is to allow for "additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns," according to a statement from Microsoft president Brad Smith.
"We will honor all commitments agreed upon with the EC and other regulators and continue to work with the CMA on the issues raised in the UK," said Smith. "We are confident about our prospects for getting this deal across the finish line."

PlayStation Plus giveth, and taketh away. Like any other running "subscription" service, every game cannot stay up indefinitely. While Sega won't be taking tax-writeoffs and erasing Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 from existence; that trio is leaving PlayStation Plus on August 15.
The news comes straight out of the PS5's UI, which notes that a selection of games (listed below, in the order they appear on the storefront) are in their "last chance to play" phase. That gives you less than a month to either play through them or eventually pony up and buy them outright.
The full list of games leaving PlayStation Plus on August 15
Borderlands 3
Nidhogg 
DCL (Drone Champions League): The Game
Yakuza 0
Yakuza Kiwami
Yakuza Kiwami 2 
Grip
Crew 2
8-Bit Armies
Carmageddon: Max Damage
Beyond the Yakuza games and Borderlands 3, this looks like a pretty standard list of games to remove from the service.  Losing three Yakuza games feels like a punch in the face, but something like DCL - Drone Champions League is fated to cycle around different services at will.
As for recommendations, Borderlands 3 is a great game to run through for free, especially if you're the type of person who likes to just see things through until the end of the story and stop there. Nidhogg is still a great party game/weekend bit of fun, and of course, nearly every Yakuza release is worth playing in some capacity.
Plan accordingly!

        <updated>2023-07-19T14:14:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will it ever happen?
Older gamers will recall legendary developer John Romero's immortal words when he was promoting his new game (new for 2000, at least) Daikatana. Sadly (or perhaps not), no one was made to feel like the Doom co-creators "bitch," and his first release after leaving id Software proved to be a flop.
Was it the worst game launch in history? It's probably up there, but it's largely been clouded by much more contemporary titles like No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/15303b5/john_romero_ama_featuring_doom_guy_life_in_first/
However, according to a recent Reddit AMA, Romero would quite happily see Daikatana make a return at some point. In response to a question about the aged FPS, he said he would "support a remake." Replying to a similar question further down, Romero adds that, if it were to be remade, Daikatana "could be an exciting game, [more so] than the original."
A Daikatana remake is just a pipe dream, so far
This doesn't mean a remake or reboot is on the horizon, as far as we know. Plus, Romero did specify that he wouldn't be involved in such a project, though he would possibly be onboard as a consultant of some kind. We already know that he's working on a new FPS with a major publisher, which he restates in the Reddit thread. Pretty much nothing is known about this project, and the man himself even says he can't say anything about it.
John Romero is something of an icon in the video game industry. While he's been making games since the early 80s, it was 1993's Doom that helped set the scene for the early days of the first-person shooter. These days, he is still active in the gaming world, even making some new maps for Doom. As such, it'll be interesting to see what he's currently working on, and whether Daikatana will ever get a second chance.

This new update, 1.1.0a, brings new items and aspects to Diablo IV alongside bug fixes, buffs and nerfs, and more. Let’s start with perhaps the most exciting addition in this update for players preparing their builds for Season of the Malignant: six new Unique items and seven new Legendary aspects. 


Unique Items
Unique Items are the highest tier of loot you can obtain in Diablo IV – I beat the campaign last night after 28 hours and only just received my first piece of Unique gear. They feature excellent stat boosts and unique bonus effects and are tailor-made for specific builds. There…]]></summary>

Just in time for our Pikmin 4 review, Nintendo has released an official interview with key Pikmin team members, which helps shed a bit of light on this previously niche (but now fairly ubiquitous) series. In it, we hear from a few familiar faces like Shigeru Miyamoto, as well as Nintendo director Shigefumi Hino, manager Masamichi Abe, programmer Yuji Kando, and art director Junji Morii.

Even in a controlled environment like a Nintendo-published interview, these sorts of glances behind the curtain are fascinating.

Prior to the release of the Pikmin 4 demo, we were of the mindset that Pikmin 3 (and its Deluxe Switch port) was the most polished that the series had ever been. The environments were gorgeous, the multiplayer was heaps of fun and the new Pikmin types added even more ways to play. In short, we loved it.
It has now been ten years since the game first launched on Wii U and it turns out that for all this time, there was a scrapped section of the game that we never knew about. Ever noticed how Pikmin 3 seems to end very suddenly? This might just explain why.

Nintendo’s Pikmin franchise, as favourably as it’s always been received by the gaming media, and as much as it has a very passionate fanbase, has never quite managed to establish a proper foothold in what could be considered the mainstream gaming space.
The original Pikmin adventure arrived perfectly formed on GameCube, serving up a unique real-time strategy experience that utterly bewitched us back in 2001. Its 2004 sequel, Pikmin 2, removed the somewhat divisive time mechanic from its predecessor and added a bunch of dungeons, improving the core experience and giving players a meatier, if somewhat more relaxed experience to dig into. Then 2013’s Pikmin 3, as fine as it was, added a few too many moving parts to the mix, removed the dungeons and, overall, ended up feeling like the best-looking but least focused experience of the bunch.

Pikmin has always held a strange spot in Nintendo’s library of games and franchises. Its creation is credited to Mario and Zelda’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, which means Nintendo holds it in high esteem, but it has never quite reached the cultural ubiquity of his other works. And maybe it’s unfair to compare the adorable strategy game about dragging the corpses of defeated foes into your spaceship to the iconic plumber and the Hero of Time, but Pikmin 4 might be the one that moves the series closer to those legacies. It represents a high point for Pikmin, thanks in large part to Oatchi, the helpful dog th…]]></summary>

Following certain problems with July's Community Day Classic event in Pokémon GO, Niantic has announced a special global 'makeup event' on 23rd July so that everyone who previously missed out has another chance to get involved.
The Squirtle-starring Community Day Classic event took place a few weeks back on 9th July, however, it seems that many of those playing the game with a Pokémon Trainer Club account experienced log-in issues and missed out on the festivities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lisa: The Painful has been described to me as Undertale before Undertale. Or Earthbound after Earthbound (so, uh, Mother 3?). In other words, Lisa was a bit of a cult classic thanks to its freaky world, absurd humour, and brutal consequences. And when I say brutal consequences, I mean your party members can permanently lose limbs or turn into mounds of saggy flesh. How’s that for a debuff? Its Definitive Edition is out now, though, so maybe its "cult" status will finally blossom into mainstream appeal. Lisa: Definitive Edition bundles in the original game and its expansion, Lisa The Joyful, as well as new enemies, bosses, stories and endings, and an easier “Painless” mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looked like the upcoming PC version of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart had already exhausted its supply of glossy, Windows-exclusive features to show off; we already knew it’s coming with DLSS, DLSS 3, FSR 2 and ray traced lighting and shadows. Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.
DirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released the opening animation for Sonic Superstars ahead of the game's release later this fall. 
Sonic Superstars is a modernized 2D adventure with four-player co-op, which you’ll need to utilize to play as Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. 
Now, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. 
The trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. 
Sega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
While waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back. 
Are you picking up Sonic Superstars on day one? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-revolution-review</id>
        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-revolution-review"/>
        <updated>2023-07-18T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. 
You see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unpacking is, for the most part, a laid-back puzzle game. I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.
A big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst. Spoilers ahead for those who have not played Unpacking.

It's unlikely the x86 32-bit support will be removed right now, which is "just museum pieces", but as an alternative would be making it SMP-only to at least remove the uni-processor code paths...]]></summary>

Well, developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone is daring me to start yet another one as he recently teased some of the new additions coming in the game's 1.6 update. Barone tweeted today that a new festival, new items, more dialogue, more secrets, and an even more nebulous “???” are coming with Stardew Valley’s next major update. Yep, that’ll do it - my new farm is already watered and I'm ready to fight/fish/romance whatever "???" is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think back on most of the cinematic platformers I've played recently, it's not the latter part of their genre title I remember most, but the former. The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. 
Full Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ryzen 5 7600X processor might be one of AMD's cheapest options in their Zen 4 lineup, but this chip is still hugely powerful compared to prior Ryzen generations. It takes advantage of its 5nm process and the AM5 socket to hit higher clock speeds, has architectural improvements that raise its single-core prowess, and of course has access to DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 add-in cards too. That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance.

The new Xbox Game Pass Core tier will cost £7/$10 for a monthly subscription and £50/$60 for an annual one. Microsoft haven’t announced plans to bring Game Pass Core to PC players, although the new tier costs almost the same amount as the (frankly much better value) PC Game Pass variant - for now, at least.


Starting on September 14th, Xbox Live Gold subscribers will be automatically converted to Game Pass Core, which allows access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a compact collection of games. Xbox’s monthly freebie program Games With Gold is also getting axed, although you can still play previously redeemed games as long as you’re subscribed to either the Core or Ultimate tiers.

Xbox Live changed the industry more than two decades ago with its multiplayer network features, but the program’s premier Xbox Live Gold has waned in popularity for the past few years, likely due to a lack of compelling free games to download. Now, Xbox is ending Xbox Live Gold on September 14 and replacing it with Xbox Game Pass Core. This new subscription tier of Xbox Game Pass will cost $9.99 per month, or $59.99 a year, and serves as an evolution of Xbox Live Gold, according to the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 7/17/23:
The U.S. Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit has denied the Federal Trade Commission's appeal of a recent ruling in the regulator's case against Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
Last week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring the Call of Duty maker. The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order the tech giant to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal and it did so on July 12. Judge Corley quickly denied this appeal, as expected, and now, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also denied it, in a massiv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Viewfinder, you solve puzzles by figuring out the right way of looking at things, and you do that here by both physically moving around its abstract 3D spaces, and by mentally wrapping your brain around its mind-bending rule set. Perspective is key because here's the thing: this is a world where you can bring photos to life, the 2D image becoming a 3D reality when you place it within the puzzle world.
It's an incredible hook and one which I've never seen in a puzzle game before. There are echoes of The Witness, Gorogoa, and Superliminal here, but Viewfinder's dizzyingly mind-melting puzzles are still very much its own. It impresses from the get-go and continues to pull tricks out of its silky tophat right until the end of its four hour run time. It's compact, brilliant, and one of the best puzzle games of 2023.

Viewfinder is all about playing with your perception and giving you the tools to do so yourself. It belongs to the difficult-to-define sub-genre of video games popularized by Portal, where you have access to a mind-blowing ability in order to solve puzzles. The danger with giving the player these kinds of god tools to get them to their destination is sometimes the well of creativity can run dry by the end, or it all just gets so complicated that the fun disappears. Viewfinder thankfully falls into neither of these traps, presenting a series of engaging puzzles that frequentl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

The suggestions included feeding employees' text chats and video call transcripts into a system to detect certain words which could indicate burnout and "time vampires."

After receiving criticism online, Niciporchik tweeted to say that parts of his presentation had been taken out of context and that the examples were "hypothetical."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell make some cracking monitors, from titanic OLED ultrawides to more pedestrian models suitable for office work and slower-paced gaming. We normally focus on the upper end of the spectrum, but today we're featuring an entry-level 27-inch 1440p model that's able to deliver excellent image quality, wide viewing angles, a higher-than-normal 75Hz refresh rate and  superior ergonomics thanks to a nice stand. All that for £175 - not bad, right? 
To get this price, you'll need to sign up for Dell's newsletter to get a 5% off code, then use it with another code - TELEGRAPH5MON - at the checkout. That brings this £259 monitor down to £175, complete with a three-year warranty and free delivery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fun as it is to pose as an expert on everything, I am not the best judge when it comes to the old psychojalimical horror. Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.
There's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common "what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for".
Protagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.

In this case, the Emmys, where it’s up for no less than two dozen awards.

But hey, when it's Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector we're talking about, I think it's okay to give it a pass. I am so, so pumped to head back into the world of the Helion System developer Jump Over The Age has created here, even if it's going to be a good long while before we get to do that yet. Indeed, when I spoke to them ahead of the game's reveal at this year's PC Gaming Show, creator Gareth Damian Martin said it probably wouldn't be until at least next year before we start seeing it in action.   
The good news is, while we wait for Starward Vector to come into orbit, Damian Martin is putting out a free monthly newsletter to help fill that Citizen Sleeper-shaped hole in our lives. Entitled The Helion Dispatches, the second episode just came out this week, and I've been enjoying it immensely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Team Fortress 2’s much-anticipated Summer Update this week has boosted the nearly 16-year-old multiplayer game to a new all-time record for concurrent players. Over a quarter of a million people were playing TF2 at the same time yesterday, almost doubling its previous record - and even that was only set last year, signalling that there’s plenty of life left in the enormously popular shooter yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seventies arcade hit Lunar Lander is touching back down from the abyss of forgotten classic video games with a modern reimagining. The still-kicking corpse of Atari is behind the incoming addition to the influential series, with Cris Tales studio Dreams Uncorporated leading development on a new game that will apparently add what Lunar Lander - a game about landing a lunar module on a bumpy moon - has been missing all these decades: a rich story.

The Blood Knights are a group of spear-wielding warriors who survived vampire bites and were saved just before the curse fully took over. Sounds badass but the new class is only available in Diablo Immortal, meaning demon-slayers will need to give Diablo 4 a break to play with the fresh bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 10:00 a.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical has been delayed by one week. 
Initially due out on August 3, the musical RPG will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10. As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. 


Here’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: 
For the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. 
These songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023.

The even newer edition features the original game's two campaigns alongside a new one designed by studio co-founders Simon Bradbury and Eric Ouellette. The fresh campaign takes us across the "devastated English hinterland," while presumably doing what you'd expect from the series: gathering resources, managing your economy, building stuff, and waging war.

In April, the CMA blocked this acquisition over cloud gaming concerns, making Microsoft’s fight for the green light in this acquisition more challenging. But it shifted its sights on the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. afterward, with plans to appeal the CMA’s ruling in the meantime. 


Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it paused its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA. The deadl…]]></summary>

I threw some toddlers in too, basking in bonanzas of candy whenever I found a pinata for them to bash open, along with a smorgasbord of chests, fruits, urns and eggs. Then I slowly swapped all of that out for gems, and my board became a pristine, soulless, basically fully optimised money printer. 
Luck Be A Landlord is about meeting ever escalating rent demands by playing a slot machine. Each month gives you a limited number of spins to come up with the money, and the chance to add one of three random symbols after each spin. Those symbols bounce off each other in zany but logical ways: bees pollinate flowers, comedians amplify monkeys. Dogs befriend humans. Billionaires get guillotined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turbo Overkill is an over-the-top first-person shooter about dual-wielding weapons, pulping monsters, and having a chainsaw for a leg. It was due to leave early access with the release of its final chapter on July 18th, but its lead developer has chosen to delay it instead. He has a pretty good reason: his development time had "been slowly sucked away as I've been coming to grips with fatherhood."

The trailer was release at the end of longer livestream where EA did at least share a few more details about their newly-named football sim.

The move away from the FIFA license was announced last year, and today, we got our first look at this year's EA Sports soccer title.
The big pitch this year from EA Sports is around its advanced technology. EA's proprietary Frostbite engine returns, but with enhancements, including the new Sapien character model skeletons first introduced through our Madden NFL 24 coverage last month. The skeleton ensures that players look more true to life when standing still but also in motion, making for more realistic movement that affects both the game's visuals and gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.
For any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).
The actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. 


Wayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. 
Clock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.]]></summary>

The survival genre is one that’s never entirely worked for me. Life is already stressful enough, and playing a game built on the idea of stress, resource management, and, well, survival has never appealed to me in my off-hours. But Keen Games, the studio behind Portal Knights, let me watch roughly an hour of gameplay of its new survival game Enshrouded behind closed doors, and I came away excited about everything it’s doing to alleviate the stresses of the genre. 
Keen Games describes Enshrouded as an open-world survival action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world drowned by a mysterious fog. You play as a unique person brought back to life by a powerful force called The Flame. From there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Ra Ra Boom, an upcoming beat 'em up headed to PC in early 2024. Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. 
Enjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


In 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a "rising tides raise all ships" scenario. 
After playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. 
Ra Ra Boom hits PC early next year.

Editor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming action RPG from Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Vampyr, which was first revealed at The Game Awards last December. The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. 
The game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  


Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.]]></summary>

As with its ancestors, you're invading a fictional country with a team of dysfunctional freelance mercenaries, managing their equipment and clashing personalities through a guerrilla war on an open world map whose every sector can host turn-based battles.
It challenges the all-smothering XCOM standard of "two actions per turn" by restoring the ancient way of the Action Point. Everyone has a dozen or so action points per turn to split between movement, shooting, or miscellaneous contextual actions. Chance to hit is never listed, but accuracy can be bumped by spending extra action points. It innovates too by giving everyone a small pool of free movement, keeping battles moving, and broadening the tactical possibilities. It borrows as much from modern designs and is mostly better for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoro.to, previously the world's largest pirate site, suddenly disappeared last week. With over 205 million visits per month, that was hugely significant, as was its rapid reappearance under a new name. Site staff initially claimed a new team had taken over, then rumors of "DMCA" problems emerged. A few hours ago, Zoro.to's domain records began pointing to name servers used by the MPA to service seized domains. Copyright issues are also confirmed.

Like a beautiful and unusual fish that has suddenly risen to the surface, Dave the Diver is an unexpected surprise. Juggling two core systems that work in tandem, it’s a game that excels as both an exploration experience and as a management sim and does so in ways that are intuitive and easy to pick up. However, the real triumph is a focus on novelty at every turn, with a near-constant supply of sudden twists, activities, and ways to engage with the game, resulting in a joyful and approachable adventure that is hard to put down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, an upcoming sequel in the classic beat 'em up series. Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.
Enjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


Developer Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. 
Secret Base says the beat 'em up features "seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves." Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Historically, its high price has been the sole sore spot, but at least it’s joining in Amazon Prime Day with big savings on both the full size and more compact tenkeyless versions.

Like Alice0 wrote when The Banished Vault was first announced seven months ago, the idea of exploring space in "an interstellar gothic monastery" is obviously an instant yes, but I'm also drawn to its neat, grid-like maps of its procedurally generated solar systems, as well as the haunting monochrome portraits of your band of exiled survivors. It looks stunning, and happily the wait for it is almost over, as Tringali and publishers Bithell Games have announced it will be coming to PC on July 25th.

The studio described the development process as an Icarus situation where the team “flew too close to the sun,” and “were unable to accomplish all the goals” that were laid out in the initial Kickstarter plans, leading to these refunds.


Bulkhead announced plans to refund players last year after cancelling the console ports, although all backers are eligible for a refund regardless of pledge tier, platform, or time played. No questions asked. Backers can find information on how to claim refunds via an email from the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Souls, the upcoming third-person horror game from first-time developer Jukai Studio, will hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this fall. 
Jukai Studio and publisher Versus Evil announced this release window in a new trailer that also revealed Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka will guest compose on the game’s score. And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” 
Check out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. 
Stray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals delivers what I have wanted out of a sequel seven years after the first game's release. Although its overarching A-to-C narrative feels like it is missing a “B” in the journey, I’m impressed with most of what Oxenfree II accomplishes. It brings back the original's simple but charming radio mechanics, adds a walkie-talkie that expands the world around protagonist Riley, and, most importantly, features incredibly well-written and believable characters. While Oxenfree II’s paranormal events are spooky an…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-11T16:38:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received.

        <updated>2023-07-11T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.
EA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.
EA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.
We'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.
The upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”
Cliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. 
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.
Black Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the second. In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-07T13:05:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emile Morel, the creative director of Ubisoft's in-development Beyond Good and Evil 2, died yesterday at 40, it's been confirmed. 
IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Stolar's family.]]></summary>
