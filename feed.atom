With the dawn of new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge DLC, there must come a new physical release. Tribute Games' bodacious beat 'em up has seen a couple of boxed releases now, but we've got to admit, Limited Run Games' latest is totally tubular.
The all-new 'Ultimate Edition' (which includes both the Dimension Shellshock and Radical Reptiles DLC) can be purchased by itself, with the fresh physical retailing for $34.99 from the Limited Run Games website.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes (July 15 - July 22):




Alpha: 
668 35 244




Bravo: 
062 06 397




Charlie: 
171 89 221




Nuke Codes reset every Sunday at 5pm PT / 8pm ET / Monday 12am UTC

A key aspect of the upcoming title is to play together, and there is plenty of PvE and PvP content to invest your time.

The armor chase has been more or less stagnant since Destiny 2 added Artifice armor alongside the 30th Anniversary Pack in 2021. Artifice armor offers an extra slot on the piece, adding a free +3 to a desired stat. It's flat-out better than any other option, and the only reason you wouldn't take an Artifice armor piece in every slot is so you can equip an Exotic in one. It sounds like that's all …]]></summary>

Having played the first two levels of the game myself, I'm fine saying that fans of Dead Cells should take note. Windblown is a 3D rogue-lite that's heavy on action and speed, allowing you to zip through beautiful levels with up to two friends in online co-op. 


If you're curious, Steam will host the game's demo during Next Fest, which runs from October 14 to October 21. The demo only contains the first biome, but it should be enough to pique your interest.

However, the trophy probably isn't something that Geoff Keighley would approve for his show, The Game Awards. It will be a claw that has bloody embellishments on it instead of a traditional statue. It's quite fitting.

Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.

Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.

It now has a release date: November 26th.

According to the statement, the pair's comments — which focused on frustrations over changes that add more modest clothing to Akira Toriyama's original character designs for the upcoming Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake — were both mistranslated and sensationalised by overseas media outlets (thanks, Automaton).

        <updated>2024-10-03T18:06:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular World War II grand strategy title Hearts of Iron IV is getting its sixth expansion pack. Paradox Interactive revealed Götterdämmerung, the upcoming expansion that will revise the German focus tree to allow the most played faction to have even more choices of direction including taking Germany down a monarchist, a restored democratic, or even an alternate fascist path.




It certainly makes sense for Paradox to revamp Germany's Focus Tree in HOI4, as other countries have gotten bigger tree revisits in recent expansions, and Germany is the most-played country. Austria has also received a revised Focus Tree, allowing players to vie for freedom from German control as well as rebuilding the Habsburg Empire with surrounding countries.


Two countries are also receiving new Focus Trees for the first time, essentially making them new options to play as. The first one is Hungary, where players will have to use technology to overcome the manpower shortages in the country. Players who succeed can eventually reform the Austro-Hungarian Empire and create a powerful unified faction in doing so. The second country getting a focus tree is Belgium. As Belgium, players can resist or welcome German supremacy and then draw on the wealth of the Congo.


Aside from the new and revised Focus Trees, HOI4 is also getting some love with various systems. Special Projects will allow players to build scientific facilities and pursue advanced research by assigning scientists to them. A new Raid function allows you to attack specific targets with carefully planned strikes such as ports, industrial structures, research facilities, and more, hitting them with targeted bombing strikes, commando raids, and paratroop attacks.


The Hearts of Iron IV: Götterdämmerung expansion is set to release on November 14, 2024 for $24.99 on PC. This expansion is also part of the HOI4 Expansion Pass 1 as well.

Over the last year or so, we've been reporting on a new OLED screen mod for the Nintendo Switch Lite from modder Taki Udon. After months of arduous work, Udon's company Retro Remake is finally at a point where it can offer up OLED kits to customers who wish to upgrade their own Lite consoles for a better screen experience.
With his latest video, however, Udon goes not one, but two steps further. In addition to installing the SUPER5 OLED screen to the new Zelda Switch Lite console, he has also replaced the standard analogue sticks with hall effect joysticks alongside an upgraded 5,000 mAh battery. The result is essentially the 'ultimate' Switch Lite for use at home and on the go, and it's absolutely stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ben Godfrey RTTK SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can unlock the special card by completing the challenge.


Godfrey becomes the final entrant to Team 1, which has seen the release of some amazing cards. While some of these cards can be only found in packs (or the market), there are no such worries with this player. Just complete the SBC, and the new promo card is yours. Let's take a look at how to unlock the latest RTTK card. 


EA FC Ben Godfrey RTTK SBC tasks


The Ben Godfrey RTTK SBC is relatively easy to complete as there's just one task to complete. The conditions of the solo task look pretty basic as well. 


Task 1 - Ben Godfrey



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Ben Godrey RTTK SBC solutions


With just one task, the latest RTTK SBC shouldn't be an expensive one to complete. Here's a template solution you can use to complete the challenge. 


Task 1 - Ben Godfrey



Bruno Guimaraes 85


Leah Williamson 85


Lorenzo Pellegrini 83


Arnel Majri 84


Svenja Huth 85


Hendrich 85


Sauerbrunn 85


Sabitzer 84


Mahrez 85


Koulibaly 84


Xhaka 86



Potential Costs: 25,000 coins


Here are the key stats of the Godfrey RTTK item.

Overall
85


Pace

Passing

Defense

I like the look of this defensive item. While he's not outstanding in terms of stats, the SBC is pretty cheap. By using fodder from your team, the completion cost will drop a lot. Additionally, he can also receive upgrades in the future, and Atalanta should do well enough in real life for him to get higher overall ratings and a new role++.

Is Lingsha worth pulling in Honkai: Star Rail?


Lingsha is in an interesting place. She's a Break/Follow-up-centric Fire Abundance character that focuses on offense to do her healing. Thanks to her plethora of buffs for both Break and Follow-up archetypes, she fits like a glove in those teams. Moreover, she is universally strong on every possible team in Honkai: Star Rail thanks to her constant cleansing and emergency healing, and if you factor in Eidolons (specifically her E1), I'd argue she is the strongest Abundance character ou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windblown is an action-heavy rogue-lite coming from the makers of the indie darling Dead Cells. For many fans of the genre, that line alone should be enough to garner high interest. But for those who need a bit more of a nudge, don't worry: Windblown is pretty dang fun.


The game comes to us from Motion Twin, which, until recently, has been supporting the 2018 breakout hit Dead Cells. Fans of rogue-lites should know the 2D action game well, as it's been propped up as one of the very best in the genre. And it is. Windblown has one hell of an act to follow.

Completing challenges at the Slumber Dojo is done while Zelda is sleeping, so any damage you take during challenges doesn’t affect Zelda outside of the challenge itself. You can use it to train and hone your Echo-choosing skills or otherwise just get rewards.

Completing “One Soldier Too Many” and another side quest called “Impa’s Gift” will allow you to pick up a third side quest, “From the Heart”. This third side quest unlocks the Customary Attire outfit, so it’s worth working towards.

New Zelda weeeeeek!
Yes, a new Zelda game is out and, rather predictably, Echoes of Wisdom has topped the Japanese charts with a total of 200,121 units sold. It's a comfortable win for Nintendo and we suspect the game will retain its position for another few weeks at least with those kind of launch stats.

        <updated>2024-10-03T15:00:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A release date has been set for Henry Hoare’s and Black-eye Priest’s latest horror game, Sniper Killer. It releases on October 17, 2024 for PC.


Sniper Killer has you alternate between two opposing roles. The first is the eponymous murderer who is tasked with taking out their targets from long range. The second is a detective who is investigating the murders and trying to stop the killer. It would really be too obvious if it turned out the detective and the killer are the same person, right? We’ll see.


Actually, from what I remember from the demo, it’s a journalism student investigating, but the new trailer says detective. It’s been over a year since the demo, so almost everything could have changed.




Sniper Killer comes from the horror development duo behind Bloodwash and Night at the Gates of Hell and Puppet Combo’s Torture Star Video publishing label. It follows the same seedy lo-fi look and feel, so there’ll be plenty of gore (and maybe a few tits), but it’ll all be charmingly low-poly and smudgy. A demo is still available, so you can try it out, but, as I mentioned, I don’t know how much has changed since then. I’ve been seeing development footage for quite a while now, and it seems like a lot of work has been done.


I’m excited. While I felt that Night at the Gates of Hell’s gratuitousness paled in comparison to the more grounded(ish) Bloodwash, both are pretty unique indie horror experiences. So, even if I’m not sure Sniper Killer will have the same thrills as Bloodwash, it’s at least going to be inventive. The fact that it seems like less of an action or slasher plot gets me curious enough.


Sniper Killer releases on PC on October 17, 2024.

Now that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is out in the wild, we suspect many of you have become fairly well-acquainted with the game over the last handful of days.
We've already asked what review score you'd give it, and it's currently sitting at #22 on our reader-ranked Best Zelda Games list. (Hey, 22 is pretty great when you consider the strength of the competition!) However, here we'd like to look at one particular sore point for a lot of critics upon release: frame rate.

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Many in the CS2 community were disappointed to see Valve allow the game's first anniversary to go uncelebrated, but it appears the developer had something big cooking that wasn't quite ready in time.


Counter-Strike 2 gets a battle pass (sort of)


The Armory Pass is arguably the most significant addition in this update. Coming in at $15.99, this allows you to earn credits for each match you play, which can be spent on all the new cosmetics (which we'll get onto soon enough). It's essentially a battle pass, where you have a little more choice over your rewards.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

Secondly, it's not the Olympics — at least, not those ones. This is the WorldSkills competition, known as "the skills Olympics," to those who take part, and it's a pretty big deal.

If you've been following the history of the FIFA series on Switch, you'll know there was a massive plot twist last year. After delivering exactly the same FIFA game for six years in a row and getting progressively more frustrated Nintendo Life reviews in the process, EA finally stepped up its game with EA Sports FC 24 and delivered, for the first time on Nintendo's console, full feature parity with all other versions of the game.
Now that this new honeymoon period for the series is over, does EA Sports FC 25 continue this bold new strategy of treating Switch owners as well as everyone else, or has EA gone back to its old ways and just delivered last year's game with updated rosters?

Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening.

As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism.

It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the fighting game, according to an interview with TheGamer. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."
Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.

Developed by Yustas and published by Wall World and Beholder outfit Alawar, it casts you as an AI mayor, Iris, who is trying to create the perfect city in a world of social and economic calamity. A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

This evening's Minecraft Live stream detailed the Bravery And Bundles update, coming next, but also another update to follow in the next few months. A creepy update.

It doesn't have a name yet, but it'll add The Pale Garden, a new biome of eerie, grey trees and hanging moss that's quiet during the day, but which at night is inhabited by a new mob, the Creaking.

There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know why we haven't written about Mechabellum before now, but we haven't. Let's correct that. It's an autobattler in which you plonk down squads of stompy robots then watch them win or lose against your opponent's army based on the formations and upgrades you've chosen. After more than a year in Early Access, it's just released version 1.0.

I spend most of my time in both those games tweaking the network of roads and junctions that form the veins of my cities, after all, and attempting to solve traffic jams via public transport and simulation-expanding mods.

Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights. It's aiming for a 2025 release and you'll find its trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an absolute carkfest of a headline to be written here involving the words "head" "not" "enough" and "giving", but I am a journalist of grace and discretion, and will resist. Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 in the aftermath of August's beta. Specifically, they're tweaking the damage from bullets to the cranium, while trying to ensure that bullets to the cranium don't "significantly affect the consistency of time to kill".

President Javier Tebas has just informed the Europa Forum that LaLiga will file criminal complaints against Google in Spain, France, Brazil, and Ecuador. Tebas accused Google of collaborating with pirates when it could immediately "reduce piracy by 80%" instead. So what does LaLiga actually want?

If you aren't, let me explain: Zachtronics are or were a US-based video game developer founded in 2000 by Zach Barth, who put the studio on ice in 2022 and now works at Coincidence Games, a "flexible business framework" involving many former Zachtronics devs. Zachtronics have thrown together all kinds of things - Infiniminer, a block-builder from 2009, is probably the single greatest individual influence on Minecraft, while Eliza is a tremendous visual novel about AI chatbots and labour politics. But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games.

I reviewed it way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person adventure where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.

Open world samurai action game Ghost Of Tsushima is getting a follow-up called Ghost Of Yotei, developers Sucker Punch have announced (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. 
The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.

Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This one’s a very simple build at the moment, but neat enough that I wanted to shout it out. Near Mint is a roguelike deckbuilder where you advance through a tower fighting slightly stronger iterations of the exact same skeleton. Ok, nothing too captivating so far. The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below. Gist is a good word. Satisfying to say. Gist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.
