        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been wandering the mystical lands in Fortnite as part of Chapter 6 content, you might have come across the mysterious Sprites.


These creatures can be found all across the map, but you can increase your chances of finding one if you know where to look. Once found, you'll want to return them to get some nice rewards in exchange.


How to get Sprites in Fortnite Chapter 6


There's no specific location where you can find the Sprites, so you'll have to largely depend on your luck. That said, they've reportedly been found more away from the different points of interest, so it will make sense for you to look further and deeper.


Once you find one, it's very hard to miss these creatures. After you pick one, you can find a new throwable item from them.



White Sprites - creates an upward air-based vortex. 


Brown Sprites - Gives you a reward


Blue Sprites - generates a fountain that heals you.





Additionally, make sure to be on the lookout for a Sprite Shrine. These shrines will help you to locate the ones that you are yet to find, and you can also return any that you have for more rewards.


How to return Sprites in Fortnite Chapter 6


Sprite Shrines are not marked on the mini-map, but it's easy to spot them. Once you come close, the place will have a light glow. If you pick up a Sprite, they will also indicate the location of a nearby shrine. Once you reach the spot, you can submit the Sprite that you picked up to get a Boon in return.


The Boons will depend on the type of Sprite you submit, but all three of them are pretty useful. You'll also get other items like weapons and consumables that can potentially help you to outlast your opponents on the battlefield.


You can find these shrines across every major location on the map, so make sure to be on the lookout for them whenever you've picked up a Sprite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The King of Kaijus, Godzilla, is now present in the colorful realms of Fortnite, and you can unlock it to cause waves of radioactive destruction on your enemies.


The Kaiju is one of many recent additions that have been made to the game, and like previous collaborations, it's part of the battle pass. The latest launch just adds to the long list of special collaborations that Epic Games has made with their battle royale. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this special skin and if it involves any kind of microtransactions.


How to get the Godzilla skin in Fortnite


Godzilla is part of the new pass, and to be more specific, it can be unlocked from Season 6, Chapter 1. This season, the pass has been completely revamped, and the format of the rewards has been altered. However, you'll first need to own the Battle Pass, which costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock.


Having the pass won't be enough, as you'll need to wait for the correct date in order to unlock the skin. On January 17, you will be able to unlock the King of Monsters, and more rewards that are part of the pass. Additionally, you'll also need to complete the quests in order to play with the skin.




The quests, as of writing, are unknown. These quests will become available only on January 17, so you'll have to wait for the time being. It will be mandatory for you to complete all these missions if you want to get the Godzilla skin to use in Fortnite.


For the time being, it appears that this skin will be exclusive to the Season Pass. However, Epic has made older skins available in the in-game store that were once exclusive to Season Passes. If that happens in the future, it will be great for those who might not be able to afford the pass at the moment.

This, however, is also admittedly quite frustrating for gamers all around the world because companies tend to announce new projects years in advance and then go on complete radio silence for extensive periods of time, without releasing any new information, images or trailers. 


Making video games takes time, and we always prefer companies not to rush or overwork developers, but they also should stop announcing video games so eagerly, sometimes before they even have any gameplay to show.

Entropy: Zero 2


Remember how the original Half-Life had expansions where you got to play with someone other than Gordon Freeman, and it still rocked? We got none of that with Half-Life 2, by the official means, that is. If you want to step into the shoes of a completely different character in that world, then consider giving Entropy: Zero 2 a shot. This time you play not as a the hero, but as an especially nasty member of the Combine.

I wish we could automate the process somehow - perhaps we just need to exploit the planet’s resources and turn it into a giant chocolate-making factory spanning the entire solar system. Yes, that should work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen Phantom Parade is now available to a global audience, making it the latest entry into the world of anime-based gachas.


It goes without saying that a game based on Jujutsu Kaisen is bound to be popular. The global servers include almost every popular character at launch. Just like the Japanese servers, a clear tier list already emerged in the first week. Certain characters are simply better and far more effective compared to the remaining names present in the game.

The global servers might have different characters available on the roster, but it's less than the Japanese version. That said, you can still have a healthy set of choices while making the pick. To classify the characters, I have used four tiers.

Like every gacha, you'll be relying mostly on the banners to get your share of characters to aid your team construction. While I found most of the characters pretty well-balanced, certain ones are better than others. Investing in them will make it the best possible use of your resources, and you will be one step closer to reaching the endgame quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GSC Game World's Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl has just received an extra patch that you can now download.


The game came out on November 20 and, even though most have been raving about it, it's hard to acknowledge the release version's rougher and likely radioactive edges. GSC Game World was quick not just to address the issues, but to come up with a patch. And what a patch that was, one single piece of software that dared to fix over 650 serious stability issues.


Though the original patch seems to have solved what it had set out to, there were some more issues left unaddressed, which GSC Game World is now attempting to fix with this new patch. The smaller but non-negligible list of fixes includes:



Fixed an issue when the second wave  would not spawn during the “On the Edge” mission, blocking further progression.


Fixed the issue when  could be found dead during the “A Minor Incident” mission, blocking further progression.


The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the  first during the “Just Like the Good Old Days” mission, blocking further progression.


The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the “All That is Left” mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.


Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.


Fixed an issue when  could be missing during the “Visions of Truth” mission.


A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.



GSC Game World has been doing a great job of dealing with these issues, and a large part of that is thanks to great cooperation with players, whom the team thanks and asks to keep on reporting any future issues here.


You can now enjoy a much more stable version of Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

Where to find the Barber in Towers of Aghasba


Despite not being a particularly important mechanic in Towers of Aghasba, you can change your hairstyle by speaking with the Barber in Midhaven. However, you won't have access to him until a few hours into the game since he is in Midhaven itself.


To unlock the Barber, you first need to gain access to Midhaven by repairing the Lutoro Bridge. This is actually the main story, so if you just follow that quest line, you'll reach this point without any problem.

When you've reached Midhaven, you'll notice that it is all in ruin and that there is no Barber present. To actually unlock him, you need to upgrade Midhaven to Tier 1 so that there is actually room for him to set up shop. You'll need mostly commonly found materials to do so, but one of the materials Gold Dust, isn't as obvious to find. Gold Dust can be found by harvesting the debris around Midhaven.


Once you've upgraded Midhaven to Tier 1, you can find the Barber at his stall to the right of the Midhaven Village Board. Changing your hairstyle is free of charge, so it can be done as often as you like.

One Piece, in particular, has some of the worst parents. It ranges from the usual deadbeat father to the outright heinous crime against humanity.


You can argue that should be expected, as the series is literally about crimes and piracy. But surprisingly, being on the side of justice doesn't equate to being a good parent. In fact, some of the best parents are pirates. Meanwhile, here are the ten worst parents in One Piece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Light of Motiram's promotional crusade is in full steam, with Tencent releasing a massive new gameplay showcase of the upcoming title.


A tsunami of controversy hit the Chinese giant as its recently announced title, Light of Motiram, seemed to look a lot like Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West — unfortunately, two of the most unique-looking PlayStation exclusives. 




Likely in an attempt to either clear its name or just make Motiram feel appealing to the point of causing amnesia in originality-starved players, Tencent released a 16-minute gameplay showcase. There's a plot twist, however, and that's about how Motiram looks like it's taking too much influence from other games as well.


Though the presentation isn't in English, it features various gameplay elements that appear to be straight out of other games. For one, it's impossible to ignore the robot hovering over us, which is highly reminiscent of our robot companion, Ghost, from the Destiny series.

Perhaps most interestingly, though, is how the game looks a lot like Horizon, but actually seems to play like Valheim. Everything, from the hunting, gathering, and building - even down to the funny droplets that rain down from the character's body when he's over-encumbered in Valheim — makes an appearance in Motiram.


Still, it's undeniable that if you manage to look past everything, Motiram looks functional. Most cobbled-together games tend to break at the seams, but Motiram looks like it plays without any issues, so that's something.

        <updated>2024-11-30T15:00:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent BBC investigation has concluded that the most popular mobile games in the UK ignore rules pertaining to the disclosure of loot box usage in video games.


Out of the 45 most popular loot box-containing video games currently being sold in the UK, only two advertise the presence of loot box shenanigans as they should under the current regulations.


The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.


Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes — 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.


However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.


Monopoly GO, the most successful game on Google's Play store — with over 50 million downloads and over 3 billion dollars in transactions — does not correctly advertise its usage of loot boxes.


Loot boxes have been a huge problem in the world of non-mobile games for a while, but gamers grew so tired of them that even big companies have been rethinking the practice. Spending real money or even just playing incessantly to open a box that may or may not contain an extra item players want is an extra-awful game of carrot-on-a-stick, one that has proven harmful both to the gaming industry and the livelihood of players.


In the mobile scene, however, things are different, and games following highly addictive and costly loot box mechanics have been thriving for a while. The less immersive and more quick reward-oriented nature of mobile games proves fertile ground for this highly addictive and dangerous practice to fester, and festered it sure has.


The BBC has asked Hasbro to comment on the issue, but has yet to receive a reply.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale.

Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we're talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those comparison pages for stars and planets - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game's armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. "Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

By calling on the Solicitor General to weigh in on the "repeat infringer" dispute between Cox Communications and several record labels, it has become more likely that the Supreme Court will eventually share its opinion on the "billion dollar" piracy controversy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"
And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?

If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24.

Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are among the weirdly publisher-specific victims of Windows 11 version 24H2, which by Microsoft’s admission (well spotted, Bleeping Computer) is causing crashes and crap performance in the affected games. Even after, in Outlaws’ case, Ubisoft responded to the complaints with their own patch.

The announcement post is mostly image-based, in keeping with the classic saying that "a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as the words in question are mostly synonyms for 'hut', 'mud', 'tree' and 'mountain'". Fortunately, Styczeń threw in a few captions to light the way.

These services do not discriminate, so whether 'customers' are pirates or just regular people hoping to buy content, everyone is a potential victim.

The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That there are more than 100 entire PC games is a revelation as shocking as it is disturbing, but despite recently spending days translating Horace’s sonorous yawps into the list that eventually became our RPS 100, a chill silence recently befell the treehouse when we realised that some of our personal favourites had somehow been excluded. Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

In Avowed, you are the god-touched envoy of a distant emperor, sent to an island realm known as the Living Lands to investigate a mysterious blight. "God-touched", in this case, means "fungal and a bit mermaidy". It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: "I hope this hurts."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workers at Reflector Entertainment, the Montreal studio that recently released third-person action adventure Unknown 9: Awakening, have been hit by layoffs, according to a number of employees who made the cuts public on social media. The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the coming weeks, the 15,000th piracy-linked resource will likely find itself blocked by Brazilian ISPs in response to yet another court order. Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet's core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let's take a closer look at how things play out.

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A "nevíme jak" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevím, co je "legálně" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat "dokumentem", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.
