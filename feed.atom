Yo Destructoid, it’s ya boy Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau, filling in for Chris Carter with an important PSA. I know y'all can’t sleep until we report whether the newest 7-Star Raid Pokemon can breed or not, and I’m here to deliver you the good news. Decidueye can, in fact, lay eggs. Here’s what you need to do.
[caption id="attachment_369210" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Bring Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic
Just like with Greninja and Cinderace, you can get a Rowlet egg by bringing Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic. For best results, remove all other Pokemon from your party to ensure Rowlet will appear as an egg. This effectively circumvents the “only one Decidueye can be caught per save file” rule of the 7-Star raid, though baby Rowlet won’t have the Mightiest Mark title. Use this trick to hook your friends up with Decidueye if they miss the event!
For more information, check out our guide to find Ditto here. We also have a detailed guide on egg hatching here. If you plan to hatch a lot of eggs, consider getting a Pokemon with the Flame Body ability as well. I've maybe written too much about this video game.
[caption id="attachment_369211" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
In Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Rowlet still evolves into Dartrix at level 17, and Decidueye at level 34
As always, all you need to evolve your Rowlet is good old level grinding. For best results, use your EXP candies on Rowlet to level it up fast. If you’ve run the 7-Star Decidueye Raid, there’s a good chance you have more than a few EXP items to spare.
This has been your Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau PSA of the day. Rest easy with this valuable knowledge in your noggin.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet took a little raid detour these past few weeks. First, we had the unorthodox Pikachu event to celebrate Pokemon day. Then we had the 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves events run for two weeks straight (which will return in the near future). Now we’re back to business as usual, with a fierce 7-Star encounter against the final evolution of a previous game’s starter.
Let’s go over how to unlock and subsequently find Decidueye.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Decidueye events start
March 17 - March 19, 2023
March 24 - March 26, 2023
Decidueye will only appear during these two weekends.

The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at "PC and Consoles" to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That planet is cracked
Dying Light studio Techland has published a teaser for its next project. Though still unnamed, the new fantasy title got a slice of concept art today.
On Twitter, Techland shared the art of its newest game. It's set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic, with an "exotic open world" to explore.
"We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for," reads the post.
https://twitter.com/TechlandGames/status/1636378215550976001
What can we see? Well, we've got a man holding onto a tree, observing a far-off city. There's some wildlife about, and some waterfalls, and off in the distance is a big, cracked planet. Not too much to go on for now other than vibes, though vibes seem squarely set in the sci-fi fantasy realm. And given Techland's proclivity for movement in the Dying Light series, probably some free-running at some point.
Sweet, sweet fantasy
It's interesting to see Techland turn to fantasy, after doing so much work in the zombie genre. But I do like the idea of some of that parkour-centric development bleeding over into a more out-there world. It reminds me of the new project from IO Interactive, where the team over there is also working on its own fantasy title.
Techland had teased an open-world fantasy game with RPG elements back in 2016, though it clarified that it has RPG elements, but is not an RPG game. Whatever the case may be, I'm definitely interested in seeing what Techland has been cooking up for its fantasy project.

Bayonetta Origins is stealing the show this week, given that it's published by Nintendo and features a pretty well known IP. Of course, you're probably wondering whether or not it's worth the full $60 price point. Well, we have a review for that! Some of you may want to wait for a price drop, but others will have a pretty good time diving into this storybook adventure.
Have a Nice Death is also worth a look, and has been in Early Access on PC for a bit. It deals with a business-oriented put-upon cartoon version of Death, who needs to "restore order" with the help of Death Inc and his associates. Both of these are in addition to...well...a ton of other games coming to the eShop this week (vaguely gestures to the bottom of this article).

Once upon a time, FMV games got a bad rap. Though once seen as cheesy and outdated, modern releases such as Her Story, Telling Lies, Death Come True, and Immortality have offered refreshing takes on the genre. This is also the case we've seen in our hands-on preview of Murderous Muses. The developer D'Avekki Studios has you exploring a haunted art museum, and you're investigating who killed the artist behind the beautiful paintings inside. While the journey can be cryptic at times, Murderous Muses so far pulls off a striking FMV experience for those who love the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take a picture with Cuno
ZA/UM has added a new way of looking at its 2019 RPG Disco Elysium. Collage Mode arrives for PC in a new update today, allowing players to place, pose, and snap pics of their favorite Disco Elysium characters.
The new Collage Mode is out now on PC, with console platforms expected to receive the update in the coming days. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and the Switch version.
Through Collage, players can make a scene anywhere around Martinaise. Full access to characters, environments, and effects will be unlocked, creating plenty of potential for what-if meetings or situations.

There are framings for special looks too, like the Visual Calculus effect. Custom dialogue will also let you essentially create the Disco Elysium fic you've wanted. On top of that, there are "bonus secrets" to discover. Apparently, this includes some new work from the Disco Elysium narrator.
The Collage Mode update will be free for all players too, so no need to pick up an extra pack of DLC.
A new cut
When Disco Elysium first launched in 2019, it made a massive impact. As the years have gone on, it's felt like the type of indie hit that sparks wave of discussion and fervor, similar to Hades or Celeste. Its psychologically driven role-playing and openness to failure have stood the test of time, as its Final Cut has made its way to more and more platforms.
Still, there has also been internal, and eventually external, strife at ZA/UM. The lawsuits finally resolved this week, but it has left a sour footnote.
For those who still want to recapture some of that Martinaise magic, Disco Elysium Collage Mode is rolling out on PC now, and will arrive on consoles in the coming days.

Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a "AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting." Today's new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
"We never stop improving," Techland's tweet reads. "Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for."

As you can see in the concept art above, this still-untitled game continues to look intriguing. Here's hoping we learn more soon!

Fledgling Canadian studio Yellow Brick Games has announced the establishment of a second studio in its native country — The new office is located in that hive of game dev activity, Montreal, and will work alongside the main offices, which are located in Quebec City.
"With the growth of recent months, we began to reach a critical mass of employees in the Montreal area, which justified offering them a space where they could have the opportunity to choose to work from home or not, to gather and to experience the Yellow Brick Games culture in another way," said Yellow Brick co-founder Thomas Giroux in a press statement.
Established in 2020, Yellow Brick Games was founded by several industry veterans, including former  Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw and Assassin's Creed: Syndicate producer Jeff Skalski. The new studio remains busy with its first project, an epic fantasy RPG sporting an original IP. A year ago today, the studio announced that it was partnering with Private Division, which is expected to publish the untitled game once its ready to roll.
"The market for independently produced games is growing rapidly and the technology is keeping pace,” said Laidlaw at the time of the studio's founding. “Small, diverse teams can now create high-quality experiences. For veterans of big-studio productions like myself and much of our team, this is the perfect time to get back to a small, agile, and highly motivated group. We want our games here at Yellow Brick to take potentially millions of players on wonderous journeys, and we want every member of our team to have a direct impact on the new worlds we’re creating.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin will launch on Steam next month, and it's now available at a "new, affordable price", according to Square Enix. Not more affordable, just "affordable", which kind of implies that the old price for the Team Ninja action game was unaffordable. 

As of today, Stranger Of Paradise therefore costs £35/$40 from the Epic Games Store, down from £50/$60. Nobody tell them that a bunch of their other games still cost $70.

        <updated>2023-03-16T17:36:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre," La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. "The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement." 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all in the family
Sumo Digital's asymmetrical multiplayer take on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is locking in dates for both a technical test and full release. The gory multiplayer will test the waters on May 25, with a full release scheduled for August 18, 2023.
Based on the 1974 horror film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre looks to pit hapless travelers against the Slaughter family that loves to prey on them. It seems to be following in the same asymmetrical steps of many other multiplayer horror games these days. The victims run and hide, using stealth and wits to survive as the Slaughter Family players hunt them down. And you really don't want to get caught, as you can see in today's release date trailer, via IGN:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlab3PEYzKE
Just real gnarly stuff. This does not seem like a multiplayer game for the faint of heart.
Deep in the heart of Texas
If that seems like your type of jam, though, there will be a technical test to kick the tires of this new horror game in May. Gun and Sumo Digital advise those who want to know more about the test to follow The Texas Chain Saw Massacre social channels, or you could keep an eye on the Steam page.
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game interests me, though not solely because of my Texan roots. Many asymmetrical horror games have come and gone, and it feels like the extremely specific adaptations sometimes have trouble sticking around. Going up against established, multi-property juggernauts like Dead By Daylight has to be tough, so I'm curious to see what Sumo Digital brings to the table to make the Slaughter Family's horror experience stand out. You know, aside from the chainsaws.
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre hits on August 18 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. It'll also be a Game Pass day one game, for both Xbox and PC.

In October last year, we reported that SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was getting a special 'BFF Edition' packed with a host of goodies (as well as the game itself, of course). The catch? It costs a staggering $249.99.
THQ Nordic was nice enough to send us one to open up, so we can at least show you what you're getting for all that cash. The headline news for many will be the inclusion of an inflatable 50cm Patrick Star, but there's a lot more inside this box than just that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.
What’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are "looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary." You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.
All three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Triangles
Dry Cactus has announced that the next installment of the physics-filled bridge builder series, Poly Bridge 3, will be arriving on PC on May 30.
The Poly Bridge series represents a surprisingly large and extensive genre of physics games in which you design a bridge. Poly Bridge takes the concept in a more lighthearted direction. Instead of simply experimenting to figure out how a suspension bridge is supposed to function, you complete various tasks that often involve creating whacked-out draw bridges. The series differentiates itself by making things accessible and fun rather than simply challenging.
[embed]https://youtu.be/bzZBURLA0iE[/embed]
With that said, I don’t know how we’ve wound up on a third title. The first Poly Bridge has over 100 campaign missions, and already my bridge-making imagination is stretched beyond its limit. I’m not saying that there is no room for more bridges, I’m just saying I can’t fathom it. Now, Dry Cactus is touting another “over 100” missions in Poly Bridge 3. Just how many gaps need to be bridged?
The trailer that has dropped alongside the announcement shows off some of its concepts, including a drawbridge that works via a front-end loader. Some of these various bridges appear to function entirely on magic, and the fact that there is some sort of tangible physics behind them makes me furious. I haven’t even attempted anything, and already, I’m feeling extremely inadequate.
I guess I can find out if my bridge-building abilities carry any sort of way when Poly Bridge 3 comes to PC, MacOS, and Linux on May 30, 2023. If you’re new to the series, Dry Cactus is also providing a discount on the first two games on Steam.

Player First Games has released a new update for its fun and chaotic crossover fighter MultiVersus, but fans hoping for new stages, characters, or balance updates will have to keep waiting, as this update seems purely focused on bug fixes and hit/hurtbox tweaks.
The new update, available now on all platforms, includes a handful of fixes for various characters, including hitbox improvements on Iron Giant, bug fixes on Garnet, stat tracker fixes on LeBron, and down special fixes for Morty. Unfortunately, there's little more in the way of gameplay tweaks, character balancing, or additional characters, stages, or fixes. This has seen players getting more than a little shouty on social media. Something which never, ever happens in gaming communities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we'll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what's going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we'll be facing off against, many of the locales we'll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer. 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There definitely are no other Persona games
Atlus has announced that they’re offering a discount on every one of the mainline Persona games on every new platform they’re available on. Except for Switch.
In a celebration of the entire series’ success, Atlus has released an accolades trailer to highlight the newest ports of Persona 3: Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal. Hm. They seem to have overlooked including a quote from our esteemed publication. Hold on; I’ll find one. Here we go:
“We exist in the darkest timeline where good things don’t happen.” - Destructoid
https://youtu.be/ZNTl9FhykBw
As for the sale, here are the details provided:
PlayStation Essential Picks Sale - March 15 to March 29

Persona 3 Portable - 20% off
Persona 4 Golden - 20% off
Persona 5 Royal - 30% off
Xbox Publisher Spotlight Series - March 14 to March 27

Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden bundle - 25% off
Persona 5 Royal - 30% off
Steam Spring Sale - March 16 to March 23

Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden bundle - 5% off
Persona 3 Portable - 20% off
Persona 4 Golden - 20% off
Persona 5 Royal - 35% off
Heaping heaps of sarcasm aside, the Persona series is terrific. If you haven’t tried one yet, now’s a decent time to give them a try. If you’re wondering where to start, Persona 4 Golden is my top pick. Should you decide you want all three, just a word of warning: they are massive time commitments. 80+ hours for each game at the minimum. They’re worth it, though, especially if you like your dating sims mashed together with RPG dungeon crawling.
Persona 3: Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal are available on PC, Switch, PS4, and Xbox One.

What are some of the bad launches we remember? What part do we play in this ecosystem? Are we just doomed to get bad PC ports for the next few years, or is this going to happen forever now.
Plus, a terrifying Tower Of Jocularity that challenges us to know when games came out (we do quite well, I think), the games we've been playing right now, and a trio of movie recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kirby finally starts to slow down.
The latest Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu, and while a number of Nintendo heavyweights continue to hold onto the top spots, this week sees an impressive Switch opening for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse (thanks, Gematsu). Debuting this week, the remaster of the 2008 Japanese exclusive sold a respectable 10,712 copies, beating the PS4 release which shifted a comparative 9,031.
This was not enough to challenge any of the highest-selling games this week, however, all of which are the usual suspects from Nintendo. Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe takes the top spot for the third week in a row, selling 32,132 copies (around half of last week's total), while Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Splatoon 3 continue to show their longevity as the titles sold 20,889 and 15,861 copies respectively.

Since then, the studio have been tight-lipped about their current projects, an “online fantasy RPG” and their mysterious James Bond game - until now. Speaking with Eurogamer, IO co-owners Christian Elverdam and Hakan Abrak shed some light on the Bond project, letting us know that it’s an origin story and that it’ll follow a brand-new 007.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Fortnite creation tool is on the way
Epic is launching its Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and its arriving very soon. The creation application will let users design and publish content directly into Fortnite starting March 22, 2023.
This creative tool has been talked about before by Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, as a way for people to build in-game content and release it in Fortnite. Thanks to the new store page for the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), we've got details on what exactly that entails.
The UEFN will allow users to import meshes, textures, animations, and audio. Animation, gameplay design, custom content, and more are all in store. Plus, it will have a Live Edit tool for real-time collaboration and revision control, as well.
Epic plans to share more details next week, during its State of Unreal talk at GDC 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teTroOAGZjM
Tap into the unreal
A few FAQs on the Unreal Editor for Fortnite page clear up a bit about how this differs from other creation tools, as Fortnite already has Creative mode. UEFN is a PC-only editor with a range of tools. Rather than Creative, where you're controlling a character to build and edit islands, UEFN has more similarities with the tools and workflows used to develop Fortnite Battle Royale itself. It's planned to be built out and evolve through its Beta launch.
The result could be a fair bit of user-generated content, a la Roblox. Which, given how massive Roblox is, makes sense. I'm curious to see just what people can do with these tools, but also very curious about what plans look like for publishing and potentially monetizing this new wave of Fortnite content. Hopefully we'll learn a bit more during next week's State of Unreal chat.

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.
It all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UFO of the River Noch*
Nintendo has announced the topic of debate that will be leading Octolings and Squid Kids into the March 2023 splatfest — And this time around it's a question of myths and legends, as hosts Shiver, Frye, and Big Man want to know whether you believe in Nessie, Aliens, or Bigfoot.
Believing in more than one is, apparently, not an option. So get off the fence and commit.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1636351619188023299?s=20
On the weekend of March 31, players will be tasked with picking their monster of choice, before rallying forth into battle against their fellow Splatoon fans. For the purposes of this particular tourney, Shiver will be repping Nessie, Frye will be Team Aliens, while Big Man, as his name would denote, is all about Bigfoot. As per usual, a public vote will be held in Inkopolis, while match points will be tallied from Pro, Open, Tricolor, and Sneak Peek, with the ultimate winner revealed on Sunday, April 2.
So, who have you got? I know aliens exist because I've seen Marvin the Martian, and I know Bigfoot exists because he lived with The Hendersons. Additionally, I know that not just one Nessie, but an entire family of Nessies exist. I'm not sure who to roll with, so I guess I'll stick with my main girl Frye, and thus I'm fighting for the Xenomorphs, for E.T. for Xtro, and for the Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
The March 2023 Splatoon 3 splatfest kicks off on Friday, March 31 and will run until Sunday, April 2.

Fireshine Games has announced Toads of the Bayou, the premiere title of French studio La Grange. So far, we know that it’s coming to Steam, and it has a release window of just 2024.
Going through the features feels like I’m going down an indie-game checklist. Stay with me here; it’s a grid-based isometric(check), roguelite (check), deck-building (check), strategy game (check), with settlement building (check). Also, it has pixel-art graphics (check).
[embed]https://youtu.be/UwhnYyFfimo[/embed]
I may sound dismissive, but I’m actually reporting this news because I think it looks pretty cool. There isn’t a lot of info here or in the trailer, but the toads; they dress real spiffy. Toads of the Bayou has you protecting your settlement from Baron Samedi, who I can never not associate directly with the henchman in Live and Let Die. You do this by building up your deck and strengthening your colony.
“The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment, and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement,” said Alexandre Clement, Game Designer at La Grange. That’s strangely motivational.
We’ve got a long wait ahead of us before we can step into the slimy wingtips of the titular toads, so I’m looking forward to seeing how Toads of the Bayou shapes up.
Toads of the Bayou is currently announced for PC and is coming out in 2024.

Square Enix has announced that its dark action-RPG, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, will finally be making its debut on the Steam platform on April 6, a little over a year on from its initial release on PlayStation, Xbox, and Epic Games Store in March 2022.
https://youtu.be/HYr9uqtCz3c
Developed by hack 'n' slash lovers Team Ninja, Stranger of Paradise is a new interpretation of the original Final Fantasy lore, and sees grumpy protagonist Jack on an all-consuming mission to eradicate the embodiment of Chaos. This single-minded principle that lead to much merriment and mirth-making among the meme community, and would even see Square Enix getting a little salty at all of the comedy.
The action-heavy adventure received a mostly positive response from critics and players, though its story, tone, and general direction proved somewhat divisive within the Final Fantasy community. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin launches April 6 on Steam at a "permanently discounted" price. It is also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via Epic Games Store.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/16/atari-acquires-berzerk-frenzy-and-10-more-classic-arcade-properties"/>
        <updated>2023-03-16T13:06:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a "dozen retro arcade games" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy," the press release reads. "Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations."
Atari says Berzerk is "a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980." It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console," Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. "Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP."
Who knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

Nintendo Switch Online has updated its library of old-school releases, offering up hours of '80s/'90s entertainment for its subscribers — The March release, which is live right now, includes titles from the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries, and includes an appearance from your favorite pink pal, Kirby!
NES
From the 8-bit console's enormous back catalog of releases, we are offered the NES port of Atari's iconic 1982 shmup Xevious. Titled Xevious The Avenger, this vertically scrolling shmup was initially released on the Japanese Famicom in 1984, and was, at the time, one of the very first third-party titles in Nintendo history. It was incredibly successful on release, which lead to a stock shortage within its launch week!

More specifically, subscribers can play Kirby's Dream Land 2 (Game Boy), BurgerTime Deluxe (Game Boy), Side Pocket (SNES), and Xevious (NES).

"Plus, run the table in Side Pocket on the Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online Library and scroll your roll in Xevious on the NES – Nintendo Switch Online library. All four of these titles are available for Nintendo Switch Online members to play today." 
These four titles join a list of dozens more in the full NSO library. You can check out every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available via Nintendo Switch Online in our running list here.

The new expansion adds a lot to Sim’s life stages, but the real show stealer here is a pesky bug that elongates babies. Yes, you read that correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Radioactive Ugly
Surreal, there's almost no other word for it — Studio Retroware has announced that it is producing a side-scrolling beat-'em-up based on short-lived '90s cartoon Toxic Crusaders. The Tromatastic release is expected to ooze on PC and consoles in late-2023, and is already price-tagged at $24.99.
Still one of the most baffling children's adaptations of all time, Toxic Crusaders is an animated spin-off of the extremely violent and thoroughly bad-taste Toxic Avenger movies — a series launched by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz' notorious New York studio, Troma Productions. "Toxie" is a superhero born after bullied nerd Melvin Junko falls into a barrel of toxic waste, emerging as a physically deformed, eye-gouging, arm-ripping vigilante. The films are notable for their avalanche of sex and violence, featuring scripts that are packed with outrageously offensive characters and jokes.
And thus, in 1991, TMNT producer Fred Wolf picked up the license for a children's TV show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-tOCfDFxhw
The Toxic Crusaders video game will see one-to-four players select from a meaty 'n' mutated roster of seven characters — including Toxie, girlfriend Yvonne, humanoid dog Junkyard, and surfing scientist Headbanger — before heading into the streets of Tromaville to clean out its pollution-lovin' villains. Toxic Crusaders will feature classic arcade brawler action, a newly recorded score, full voice acting, motion-comic cutscenes, and cameos from other denizens of the Troma universe, including Poultrygeist and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.
While I'm still kind of reeling from this bizarre news, I have to admit that if the aftermath of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge means we're to be inundated with beat-'em-up love letters to '90s shows, then I'm here for it.
Toxic Crusaders launches late-2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.


If you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.


You can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs.

When you think “music game”, you probably think “rhythm action”. Well, Stockholm-based indie team Ichigoichie is here to confound your expectations with Backbeat, a funkily fiendish puzzle game about the intricacies of playing in a band.
Ichigoichie’s first game was 2019’s Hexagroove, where they were already shaking music gaming up by mixing dance music creation, DJing, and Gitaroo Man-style track-following rhythm action. The studio’s heritage even goes back, via co-founder David Ventura, to the Nintendo DS classic Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! (progenitor of Elite Beat Agents in the West). And that game’s goofiness of story and characterful overworld map extend their tendrils through the decades all the way into 2023’s Backbeat, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean will flow into all consoles
Sabotage is bringing its upcoming RPG Sea of Stars to more platforms at launch. Today, the studio confirms that Sea of Stars will head to Xbox consoles on August 29, the same day as it arrives for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.
This updated launch platform coverage includes both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, so both generations will be able to play the new adventure. There's also a demo out, though it's currently only available on the Nintendo eShop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3NNRkR1fSw
Sea of Stars sees two protagonists, the Children of the Solstice. With one wielding sun powers and the other moon, they combine to create Eclipse Magic, the only thing capable of stopping The Fleshmancer. It looks quite nostalgic, helped by the fact that Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda is a specil guest composer on the soundtrack.
You're a sea full of stars
This RPG is also the latest project from Sabotage, the studio behind 2018's The Messenger. In that one, the team tackled a different kind of old-school genre in the action-platformer. Here, with Sea of Stars, they take on the classic turn-based RPG.
I played a little bit of the demo and found it intriguing, though I'm mostly holding off for the full game. I will say, I do really like the look that Sabotage has crafted for Sea of Stars so far. It's a colorful world with some great little details. Now, Xbox players will also be able to see it for themselves at launch alongside other platforms.
Sea of Stars arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch on August 29, 2023.

I feel bad for absolutely every multi-player focused game entering the current market. They survive entirely on maintaining a player base, and a lot of folks will just play whatever their friends are playing. So, in order to succeed, they not only need to bring in people, but also the people those people associate with. It doesn’t matter if a game is good or not. Many people still playing Destiny 2 hate it, but it’s what their friends are playing.
Capcom seems to think they’ve found the secret ingredient: butts. And dinosaurs. Right there, those are two of my favorite things. Exoprimal is a game about robots who never miss leg day fighting dinosaurs. And it is… a game. And now I've played the beta.

The sequel looks to be based on the game Silent Hill 2, with Jeremy Irvine (War Horse) cast as James. After being separated from his one true love played by Jigsaw's Hannah Emily Anderson, he'll head to Silent Hill in search of her. Of course, things don't really go as planned from there on out.

Resident Evil 4 might only exist in demo form right now, but that hasn't stopped the indelible mod community from already bringing its own host of nightmarish characters to the infected villages of Europe. Case in point: This new mod from IvenXIII, which sees the worst animated character of all time, Shrek, battle to the death with special agent Leon S. Kennedy.
The mod, which is available for the PC version of the demo via hubworld Nexus Mods, sees the green menace replace the chainsaw-wielding Dr. Salvador, who comes barreling into Leon's world as a seemingly unstoppable member of a homicidal clan of villagers. Shrek carrying a chainsaw, complete with DEAD EYES, may be one of the most unnerving images in Resident Evil history, to be sure.

Shrek is not the only mod available for the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo, as other mod makers have already come up with replacement skins for Leon himself, including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas star Carl "C.J." Johnson, (by SERGIS2547), Uma Musume character Mihono Bourbon, (by ClownGodCG), and even a femme version of Leon themselves, (by wheezer123). Currently, there is no sign of a certain Tank Engine, but the grinning fool is practically guaranteed to make an appearance once the full game is released. It's pretty much tradition at this point.
There are other gameplay mods available on the site, including one which never triggers the church bell, offering infinite time to take on the entire village. All the mods available from NexusMods will require the installation of Fluffy'sModManager. Obviously, read up and make sure that you know what you're doing before you start prodding around in your registry folders and such.
Resident Evil 4, with or without Shrek, launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Chainsaw Demo is available to download now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Boy
A dazzling Japanese "3D" billboard for Square Enix hit Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been declared the winner of a contest held by the Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Association (TOAA).
The Final Fantasy VII 3D billboard, which could be seen in Tokyo back in the winter of 2021, stars beloved party member RED XIII, who is chased down by a Shinra helicopter high up over the rooftops of Midgar. Fortunately, it all ends happily, as our boy falls into a toy warehouse, for some goofy fake moustache chicanery. It's a genuinely fascinating and gorgeous piece of animation, and one can only imagine how much joy it brought to onlookers during the holiday period.
You can check out the full animation in the video below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6OFS3DCmmA&ab_channel=%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9
The Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Contest, which is held every two years, recognizes advertising that it believes not only displays creativity and amazing visual design, but that also suitably fits in with the environment, offering a form of "art and spectacle" over the general crassness and tackiness of most advertising. Also brought into consideration are the advert's impact on the surrounding area, and whether or not it disrupts the aesthetic of the local area.
While 3D billboards are nothing new, they are still incredibly sparse in their use in mainstream society, generally located to major metropolis' such as Tokyo, New York, and countries such as China and South Korea. They use depth perception and optical illusion to make characters appear to be leaping out from the buildings themselves and, when partenered with imaginative brands and beautiful animation, make for visually stunning talking points for passerbys.
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is available now on PS5 and PC.

Speaking of which, we now know a little more about the next title in the Natsume-owned rival series, which has the catchy title, Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos.

I would watch pretty much anything Resident Evil 4 adjacent. That world was a whirlwind of action and silliness, and lends itself well to all sorts of mods, parodies, and projects. There's a reason people are still talking about it all these years later, and why it's basically Skyrim-tier in terms of its multiplatform port proliferation. That fan fervor likely led to this new delightful LEGO animation from creator Cara Aleatorio, who re-imagined the game's intro sequence.
Simply titled "Resident Evil 4 Animation," we're once again whisked away to the intro a lot of us have experienced 50 times or more since 2005: as Leon Kennedy arrives at the initial village in Spain. He quickly discovers the aggressive inhabitants, and the game never really stops from there on out. According to Cara Aleatorio, the project was made in Blender, with the Mecabrics add-on. It took "around 3000 images" to finish up the nearly four minute video, and "1-2 months" of work.
It's amazing how burned in my brain this intro is, and how big of a shock it was to see how things were changed (both subtly and not-so-subtly) in the remake. I can't wait to see all of the reactions from first-timers and long-time fans, but little things like the tower floor in the village square demo collapsing really got me.

Terminal Reality is actually the original developer of Terminal Velocity, having released it way back in 1995 for DOS. The three-episode game was released by Apogee under their 3D Realms label, who gave away the first episode for free as part of their shareware method of distribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return to the Eye
Wake up, Sleeper. There's one last piece of free DLC on the way. Citizen Sleeper gets its third free DLC episode on March 30, just one day ahead of its launch on PlayStation consoles.
Jump Over the Age's narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper was released last year, and has made its way to most other platforms alongside its DLC rollout. On March 31, both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 owners will get a chance to check it out as well.
For those who already own Citizen Sleeper, March 30 will mark the third free DLC episode's launch date. Dubbed "Episode 3: Purge," it's set to bring a conclusion to the refugee flotilla plot line introduced in this string of post-launch updates. These episodes are free updates for owners of the game, and will arrive packed in with the PlayStation versions.

Wake up Sleeper
If you haven't checked out Citizen Sleeper yet, or just need a good excuse for another run, this is a solid reason. I haven't dipped back in yet to see just how the new episodes are rolled into the full experience, but now that the plot line's concluded, I'm feeling a bit tempted.
Citizen Sleeper is a narrative RPG that draws hefty inspiration from tabletop games. As a Sleeper, an artificial body with a copied consciousness on the run from corporate overlords, you have to survive day-by-day on Erlin's Eye, a station on the fringes of settled space. Though it starts as a race against the clock, it swiftly becomes a story about community, history, and how people support each other.
It's a really incredible game, one I felt confident in naming as one of my favorites of 2022. Whether you're a new Sleeper on the Eye or returning for another run, there will be some new stories waiting for you later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like clockwork
As I've said in the past, Nintendo has been pretty good about getting physical My Nintendo rewards up on their end for pretty much every AAA game they've released. That also includes Metroid Prime Remastered, which just debuted its physical reward today.
Clocking in at 800 Platinum Points, the reward is a set of two pins, one of which is the game's logo, and the other: Samus, of course. These pins are on top of the downloadable Metroid Prime Remastered alternate box art cover. Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"A set of two rustless-iron lapel pins inspired by the Metroid Prime Remastered game are available to My Nintendo members. The game logo pin measures 3.5" x 1.77", and the Samus pin measures 3" x 2.9". Pin them to your hat, jacket, or other gear to show your fandom!"

You love to see more Metroid merch out in the wild, even something as small as pins. It's hard to find basically anything featuring this series, and it's always great to see Nintendo remember that it exists. But with Metroid Dread making them a ton of cash, they're well aware of that now!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Atlus has a lengthy and respectable pedigree, and it makes sense to trot that out every so often to remind people just how long they've been around, and what they've accomplished. Announced today, Shin Megami Tensei 30th Live: Band of Shadows Concert is going to do just that. Held at The Novo in Los Angeles on July 1, 2023, Atlus is calling this the "first ever live anniversary concern for Atlus in the west," and will provide an evening of "musical performances from the Shin Megami Tensei series."
It's a collaboration between Atlus, the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, soundtrec (a live concert production company), and Soho Live (a Tokyo-based music agency). Atlus notes that it is part of Anime Expo, and is "exclusive to those attending the convention."
Okay so the cat is out of the bag, but unfortunately some info is still TBA. Atlus says that ticket cost and the date when tickets will actually go on sale will be revealed later on. We'll be sure to keep an eye out and update you when this happens! You can also subscribe to the newsletter on the official site to get up to date info.
Seeing SMT get some love like this in the west is a bit shocking, especially when Atlus could have held yet another Persona concert. You love to see it.
Here is all the info you need on the US Shin Megami Tensei 30th Live: Band of Shadows Concert

        <updated>2023-03-15T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive "Fury and Zen" clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.

It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer, our Ed was lucky enough to see gameplay from Atlas Fallen, the upcoming action RPG from Deck13, the gang behind The Surge games. The game’s sandy dunes and over-the-top combat gave Ed chirpy AA vibes, whle the rest of us were relegated to the initial CG trailer and the hands-off preview. Until now. Publisher Focus Entertainment have now debuted a gameplay trailer for all of us, too - although it mostly consists of second-long combat snippets, sandwiched in between very grave and serious and important VO.

PlayStation and Citizen Sleeper developer, Jump Over The Age, who is actually just solo developer Gareth Damian Martin, announced this today in a new PlayStation Blog post. The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. 
I reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios’ long-awaited remake of System Shock finally has a release date, at least for PC. The reimagined classic arrives on May 30.
For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. 
System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed Tekken 8 last September and since then, the company has been slowly teasing more information about this upcoming fighter. We've seen gameplay, the reveal of Nina Williams' return, and just last week, we learned Paul Phoenix would be riding into Tekken 8 as well. 
Now, Bandai Namco has revealed that Marshall Law will be in the Tekken 8 roster in a new gameplay trailer. Marshall Law was introduced to the series in the very first Tekken game and he's been in quite a few since, including the most recent release in the franchise, Tekken 7. If you're familiar with this fighter, his heavy-hitting combos return in Tekken 8, if this new gameplay trailer is anything to go on. 
Check out the Marshall Law gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Tekken 8 does not yet have a release date but when it does launch, it will do so on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more information about the game, head to Game Informer's Tekken 8 hub.

Earlier in January, we learned that Breaker’s roguelike structure would include procedurally generated open worlds, and we’ve now seen them in action thanks to its first gameplay trailer. Breaker doesn’t look as effortlessly stylish as its predecessor, but its bullet-hell action and fast-paced traversal have me eager to learn more when it launches into early access this Fall.

Sure, it's not quite as bad as 'death by exploding sun' in Outer Wilds, say, but when each crash is also accompanied by heroine Junon reliving a harrowing memory from her past that she'll need to sort through and analyse before she's able to (quite literally) move on with her life, I reckon that one-two punch of sudden physical trauma and deep, emotional soul-bearing is probably just about on par with having skin and muscle seared off your own bones by a honking great supernova. You know, figuratively speaking.

Puzzle Quest 3 utilizes the match-three and role-playing mechanics from past games, complete with head-to-head battles where enemies can manipulate the puzzles of their opponents. This third entry also introduced a new adventure mode, a larger puzzle board, and seasonal storylines.
The match-three RPG garnered some fanfare thanks to its recognizable franchise name, but reactions to the Early Access version have been divisive. With nearly 400 user reviews on Steam, the reception currently sits at a "mixed…]]></summary>

Few games in recent memory etched a permanent smile on my face the way Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has. This prequel to the Bayonetta series rewrites its mature-rated stylish combat within the whimsical pages of a storybook, spinning an endearing yarn of a young witch fighting to prove herself while forming an unlikely friendship. The result is an eye-catching, unexpectedly dense adventure that has more charm than it knows what to do with. 
Despite arriving only a few months after Bayonetta 3, Cereza and the Lost Demon doesn’t feel like a throwaway sid…]]></summary>

That means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.
Check it out in the Xbox release date trailer below: 


If you're hopping into Valheim today, be sure to check out our list of the best Valheim mods and then check out this impressive magic mod that brings some Skyrim flavor to the game. After that, read about the aftermath of success as it relates to Valheim in this exclusive feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. 
That's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently "no plans" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
It's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!
March 13, 2023
As you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). 
In the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. 
While waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking around the deserted streets of Los Angeles - and you can take your leisure, in Dead Island 2, because most zombies are quite shambly - I encountered many a rich-person decor. Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape.

Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing.

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Blinking for the first time in Before Your Eyes is a genuinely magical moment. I don’t mean hitting a button to close your virtual eyes. Through the power of a webcam, Before Your Eyes tracks when you blink which allows you to progress through a wonderful narrative adventure title from GoodbyeWorld Games.

I'm always up for a wander in the woods. I am a bit of a genre purist so with a name like Sons Of The Forest, I was concerned it might be another of those so-called walking sims that are more concerned with making you listen to a Radio 4 dramatic monologue. Thankfully, no, this is simply a pretty walking simulator exploring an island bustling with wildlife. Here, enjoy this video with some sights from my peaceful strolls.

You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

Luckily, puzzle is a mainstay genre in video games, from classic point 'n' click adventures to weirdo physics puzzles and aliens in space. Puzzle games can also be RPGs or adventure games; they can have horror or hacking. There are so many, in fact, that curating a list of the best puzzle games is something of a puzzle in itself. But at RPS we like a challenge, so we've brought you a new and improved list of the 25 best puzzle games on PC that out there today, in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favorite fighter Paul Phoenix has punched his ticket (among other things) for Tekken 8, and he’s so excited that he’s let his hair down for the first time in years. 
A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse plunges players into the dreadful past of Rougetsu Island as three (Young women? Girls? I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal reared its scaly head during today’s Capcom Spotlight, revealing a new trailer delving into the game’s bonkers plot and a reveal of a July 14 release date.
A new trailer reveals the game centers on a time-loop, as a team of soldiers travel to the past and find themselves reliving the same day. Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. 


As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than a month to go until the theatrical release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members' attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.
The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy; The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power.

Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprise RPG remaster The Outer Worlds: Spacer’s Choice Edition has turned out to be even more of a PC wilter than its raised system requirements would suggest. I’ve only been bumbling around the starting planet of Terra-2 so far, and thus haven’t seen every single weather system upgrade and character model touch-up that the Spacer’s Choice Edition has to offer, but it’s made a worrying first impression in the performance department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a thrilling follow up to last week's episode, The Electronic Wireless Show podcast today discusses sequels and serieseseses, in light of some surprise announcements of sequels over the last week (Nate isn't here today, but maybe he'll return in the next entry? You'll have to listen to find out). In games we seem to accept that a series running for decades, over many, many sequels, is just kind of normal. What's the deal with that? Would games be better without sequels? Who knows? Us. We do. We talk about it today.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/09/resident-evil-4s-rain-will-be-adjusted-in-day-one-patch"/>
        <updated>2023-03-09T15:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild Hearts gets its first free content updates this month in the form of new Kemono (the game’s term for monsters), quests, and more. Players won’t have to wait long because the first DLC hits tomorrow, March 10. 
On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.]]></summary>

Here's hoping it will also be available on PC, and not just PlayStation this time.

An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

The news was announced via a two-minute video, where director Todd Howard also revealed Bethesda will be holding a special Starfield Direct in June, just ahead of E3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised last year, Halo Infinite’s season 3 update has arrived with a new ray tracing option for us PC folks. Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, Bethesda's mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a "deep dive" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.]]></summary>

Originally, Bilkins' Folly was due out on just PC but Webbysoft has added PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch to its list of platforms. A release date has not yet been revealed but the game is due in "late 2023." In Bilkins' Folly, you play as treasure hunter Percival "Percy" Bilkins who, with his canine best friend Drayton, embarks on a quest to find their missing family that myseriously vanished years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have a go of Sons Of The Forest," my compatriots at RPS told me. "It's a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!" And I was like, "wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?"
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary "photo mode" way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”

Developers Battlestate Games are stepping up their efforts not only to ban cheaters but to show other players that "justice has been served", by releasing the usernames of thousands of players banned for allegedly cheating.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-07T18:56:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order," a press release reads. "Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice." 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable "economic context" as the reason it's shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016's Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021's Aragami 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's "Best Shooter" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens' lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that's why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.

This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems.

The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity's hiatus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seth Rogen announced in 2020 that he was producing a new animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and today, Paramount Pictures released the first trailer for it...and it looks great!
What's especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It's reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it's also very much its own thing.
Check it out for yourself below in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem trailer below: 
From permanent teenager @SethRogen, a new generation of heroes will rise...from the sewers.

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
