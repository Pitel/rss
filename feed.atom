Nintendo tweeted the surprise announcement today that you can download the app from the Switch eShop. Now you can watch your streamer of choice play Animal Crossing: New Horizons or complain about the Nintendo 64 emulation on the online Expansion Pack. Given the lack of many popular streaming services on the eShop, such as Netflix, the fact that Twitch made the cut is a small miracle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bullet hellish experience.
Heaven's Machine is the first of Super Rare Games’ ‘Super Rare Shorts’ series; brand new indie games only released on the Switch in physical form and only available to buy during a short open preorder window. It's certainly an unusual idea but, unfortunately, this is probably not the start they were hoping for.
Heaven's Machine is a twin stick controlled action roguelite filled with guns set onboard a heavenly train — so far, so promising. However, it will kill you off very quickly if you try to play it like a twin stick controlled action roguelite filled with guns set onboard a heavenly train. Rush in guns blazing and you’ll soon discover that, due to the spread of bullets onscreen and often tight areas, your short dash is just as likely to get you into trouble as it is out of it. Getting hit seems to offer no grace period whatsoever: if four bullets are overlapping when they hit you, you get hit four times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you preordered a Playdate handheld gaming device that was set to ship this year, you’re going to have to wait a little bit longer. 
Panic Inc. announced today that its first batch of Playdates originally set to ship in 2021 have been delayed to early 2022, citing a “critical battery issue” that was caught late in the process. As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.
“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” 
Panic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. 
For more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn't the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve's Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch.

Editor's note: This article discusses an audio-based character moment near the end of Metroid Dread. If you're sensitive to spoilers, you may want to finish the game and come back to this article later...

For 15 years, Metroid Dread was just a rumor. Now, it’s real, it’s been out for over a month, and it’s fantastic. Samus Aran’s latest adventure is packed with just about everything a Metroid fan could ask for, from wild boss fights to a massive labyrinthine map.

“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” 
Extraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms. Gematsu reports that two Buddy Pass tokens will come with each copy of Extraction. These tokens allow you to invite two friend to play it with you for 14 days for free. If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. 
Ubisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. 
Today’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January. While waiting for it to be released, read about how its old name was Rainbow Six Quarantine (you can probably guess why it was changed) and then check out Game Informer’s Rainbow Six Siege review after that.

IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.
For those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival.

Spider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.

Halo Infinite's upcoming release marks an exciting time for Xbox fans the world over. The return of Master Chief is shaping up to be an exciting affair and we're giving you a quick 4K look at the opening mission from 343's latest adventure!
In this clip, we find John-117 fighting off the Banished, a familiar yet new group of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites that have found their way to the Zeta Halo and are wanting to use its power for their gain.

Halo Infinite is a few mere weeks away, but you don't have to wait that long to get a new look at campaign gameplay! Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief's next adventure!
There's a ton to unpack here, but we're showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today's video. Throughout Halo Infinite's campaign, you'll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that's saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game's most treacherous bosses. There's no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you'll see in the footage above). 
While you're giving the Banished hell, don't forget to look around. In today's gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game's upgrade currency that will enhance Chief's equipment, such as the Grappleshot. 
We also get to show off one of the game's newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It's a Banished weapon that feels like it's in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.
This is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343's latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more! Thanks for watching, and we hope you enjoy the coverage!]]></summary>

As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.
However, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before. After an i…]]></summary>

With gorgeous translucent designs by Mel Kishida, as well as a story that depicts the youth of lifelike girls, based on a theme of human identity and bonding, a new title in the BLUE REFLECTION series is here! Story Under a piercing blue sky, surrounded by crystal clear water, the sun scorched Ao Hoshizaki's skin. Gazing at the summer scenery, it seemed as if the girl was left behind in a world that she had wandered into. At a school adrift in the distance, there lived three girls who had lost their memories. The only thing they could remember was their names. Ao, shrouded in confusion, begins to lead a strange communal life with the girls as they seek clues about a way to return to their original world. One day, in this world where the school was surrounded by nothing but water, a path that led to new scenery suddenly appeared. At the end of the path was a mysterious location, where familiar things existed inexplicably. - Read our BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light review

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Switch port of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced during the Nintendo Direct that aired back in September, and finally, after a little over a month of waiting, it’s available for purchase. 
KOTOR was first released on the original Xbox and PC in 2003, and it was later ported to Mac, iOS, and Android devices by Aspyr Media, the studio now heading the PlayStation 5 and PC remake of the classic RPG. Due to Xbox’s overall backward compatibility support, the original version of KOTOR has been playable on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles. As of today, it’s playable on Switch.

We know a little about Bethesda's upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what's in store. During a Q&A on Reddit, he talked about the game's character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One goal is to "protect creators from harassment".
It's fair to say that the incredible growth of the internet and in particular social media has changed its feel a great deal over the years. So of us are old enough to remember when the web was a rather quirky and surprisingly friendly place, but its all-encompassing presence in modern life now leaves websites and social media networks grappling with a variety of factors. How do you support 'free speech' but protect people from harassment and bigotry? How do you encourage honest feedback but shutdown the viral trend of review bombing and sustained downvoting campaigns?
In the video above YouTube confirms that, rolling out gradually from today, it'll address part of the challenge by hiding the dislike 'count' on videos. The button will still be there, and disliking content will still influence your recommendations (and likely have some impact on the site's algorithm, but that's a bit of speculation on our part), but the count won't be shown to the public. Creators will still be able to see it in their analytics, though, should they want that data feedback. If you're feeling cynical, too, hiding it from public view may also allow YouTube to sell the data to external marketing agencies in the future.

To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I'm very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don't talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by 'Bath's Nic Cage', and discuss the time he turned on Bath's Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you're all proud of us. We're showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect a handful of cheats to be missing from Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. 
The GTA franchise is known for a lot of things, including cheats. These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. 
However, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. 
“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” 
USA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.
While waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.

Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain is just weeks away from launching on Switch, and Nintendo's busy convincing us to pick it up with a brand new commercial starring Neil Patrick Harris.
The How I Met Your Mother actor, who's also starring in a Nintendo-themed holiday film this year called 8-Bit Christmas, is seen enjoying a game or two with his family. As we imagine plenty of parents will relate to, he's forced to sneak in some practice to take on his kids – how are kids so good at these games, anyway?

It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an interactive cheesy sci-fi action movie, for better or worse. It boasts incredible – and wonderfully improbable – action sequences propelled by a story that barely qualifies as narrative. Infinite even has a run time that is comparable to some films. Unfortunately, Bright Memory: Infinite burns out before it fades away, peaking early and showing great promise before concluding sooner than expected.

However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Mayhem.
Party games feel right at home on the Switch, don’t they? With the recent launch of games like Mario Party Superstars and Fisti-Fluffs, it feels like there’s always something new to play within the multiplayer genre. Tossing its hat into the ring, My Singing Monsters Playground shares much of the same DNA as Nintendo’s own Mario Party series, with a plethora of minigames to enjoy with friends and family. It does, however, feel like a bit of a bare-bones experience, lacking an overarching campaign or structure to bind the minigames together.
Based on a hugely successful mobile franchise, My Singing Monsters Playground features a cast of, well… monsters. Not the kind of monsters that haunt your dreams or hide under the bed, but rather more cute and cuddly monsters that look like they’re on their way to a shindig with Mike Wazowski. Each time you boot up the game, you’re presented with options to select how many players are competing (up to four), before giving a choice of seven different monster designs. Our personal favourite is Furcorn, who looks like a furry bean with legs and a twig sticking out of its head.

Recent releases, and the reactions to those releases, point to The Pokémon Company facing an interesting challenge at it celebrates its 25th Anniversary. On the one hand the franchise is continually trying to grow and attract new fans of various ages; on the other there are Pokémon players that are long-term fans and have expectations around the evolution and progression of the IP.
Some of the criticisms in recent years have been fair, we'd suggest, especially with accusations that the games haven't shown enough improvement in terms of presentation and mechanics - especially considering the size of the IP and resources at the company's disposal. Yet arguably some areas of criticism are tough to resolve, as the franchise tries to balance its approach to old and new fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re someone looking for a PlayStation 5 in time for the gift-giving season, or even before the end of March, it’s now going to be even harder. 
Buying a PS5 already feels like an arduous task. Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million.

Bloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. 
The PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. 
While waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues.

There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

Nintendo has shared a quick overview of the major releases headed to Switch over the next couple of months and into 2022. We don't know about you, but we're starting to think that 2022 could be one of the system's best years yet.
As you can see in the handy image below, there's an awful lot to look forward to for fans of Nintendo's biggest franchises. We've got a brand new Zelda with the sequel to Breath of the Wild, a new Mario + Rabbids, a new Splatoon, a new Kirby, and three new Pokémon games, and that's before you take the likes of Bayonetta 3, the Advance Wars remakes, and more into account too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

It's well known that Tencent has been acquiring shares in a broad range of game publishers and developers, increasing its investments and influence in the industry. While a lot of those moves have been public, Bloomberg is reporting that Tencent quietly acquired 90% of Japanese company Wake Up Interactive group in September, paying around 5 billion yen ($44 million).
The name may not be too familiar, but the group owns Soleil Ltd, which has developed some very decent games in recent years - including on Switch. It's worked with the Naruto franchise on other systems, while on Switch it's brought us Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time and Ninjala. It has two projects in the works right now - Wanted: Dead and Vengeance is Mine - but they're both on PC and new/next-gen hardware (PS5 and Xbox Series X|S).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re excited to see if you gel with The Gunk, you won’t have to wait much longer now as Image & Form Games have revealed its release date: December 16. 
The team behind the SteamWorld franchise first announced its upcoming exploration game, The Gunk, during the Xbox Games Showcase back in 2020. Image & Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December.

Now, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. 
“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” 
As noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image & Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  
While waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image & Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thunderful held a showcase today featuring upcoming games from the publisher including The Gunk (which holds a newly announced December release date) and the Stadia timed-exclusive aquatic adventure Wavetale, which releases today. Capping off the presentation was a brief look at the next chapter in the SteamWorld franchise, SteamWorld Headhunter.
The teaser (which you can watch below) features two robotic cowboys featuring spectacular 'staches facing off in a familiar pistol dueling position. You know, desert town, high noon, and all of that. One automaton looks to have lost the shootout, and in the process, lost his head. When the victor checks on the deceased's condition, only to find its head is detached and flying at him with deadly intent.

Thunderful isn't saying much about Headhunter other than it's a direct follow-up to "the (literally) earth-shattering events of SteamWorld Dig 2" and will be a full 3D, co-op action adventure experience. In honor of the announcement of Headhunter, SteamWorld Dig 2 is currently free to download on Steam and GOG starting today and lasting until tomorrow, November 11 at 11 a.m. Eastern. 
What do you think of the teaser for SteamWorld Headhunter? Are you interested in seeing more of the surface world, or would you prefer to dig into the depths of the planet some more? Shovel your thoughts into the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.
The delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here's Valve's announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:
It looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you've pre-ordered one already.
While it's disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn't a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. 
The Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.
As you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. 
Spidey joins the fray via the free "With Great Power" hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it's tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. 
For non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix's disappointment in Avengers' performance here. 
What do you think of Crystal Dynamics’ take on Spider-Man? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-11-10T18:31:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Industry figure Geoff Keighley has revealed that his annual gaming awards show, aptly titled The Game Awards 2021, will feature somewhere between 40 to 50 games. 
This news comes by way of a news post by Epic Games about the awards show and in it, Keighley revealed that he learned from last year’s event that “games and the trailers” are what drive the show. He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. 
“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” 
Keighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. 
The Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. 
This year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. 
While waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.

As previously revealed, the controls have been revamped to match Grand Theft Auto V’s. Shooting and targeting have been improved, including better drive-by controls for San Andreas specifically. You can also now immediately restart failed missions instead of being kicked…]]></summary>

It saw new titles like Far Cry 6, Back 4 Blood, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and more hit the market. It’s no surprise that many of these debuts lead PlayStation’s top downloads for the month of October, either. 
PlayStation released the top October downloads for its multiple platforms today and at the number one spot in the United States and Canada is Far Cry 6, followed by FIFA 22 in second, and Back 4 Blood in third. On the EU side of things, it’s a touch different: to nobody’s surprise, FIFA 22 was the top download with Far Cry 6 in second and Back 4 Blood in third.

I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

You defeat eight gym leaders, conquer the elite four (or whatever other monikers that a specific region might use), and then enter the annals of the Pokémon Hall of Fame. Beyond this, you might unlock a new area with challenge battles/scenarios, or, in the case of Gold and Silver, you travel to an entirely new region with its own trainers and points of interest. 
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will likely come with some impressive extra features after the credits roll. Moreover, a new trailer and press release revealed Ramanas Park, an endgame nature preserve of sorts where you can catch legendaries from across the entire franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5 was officially released yesterday, both as a game you can purchase and a title available on Xbox Game Pass. For those that purchased special editions of Horizon 5, it’s been playable since last Friday. 
After yesterday’s official launch, the new open-world arcade driving game from Playground Games hit over 4.5 million players, according to Xbox head Phil Spencer. This makes the launch of Forza Horizon 5 bigger than any Xbox Game Studios launch before it.

It doesn't have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there's one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

If you elected to get into the test, I hope you get in. First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way – this text contains lots of information and lots and lots of spoilers.

Anime and brawler fans alike came together to either relive their favorite battles/fantasy fights across myriad series or embark on a new, ambitious fighting experience touting a sizable roster at release. I might not have purchased Jump Force when it launched back in 2019, but I remember throwing together A Short Bio Of Every Jump Force Character as a Game Informer intern. I was impressed with the sheer amount of licensed anime shows that were slated to appear in the game (and exhausted by the end of writing all those dossiers). However, early next year Jump Force’s digital availability and online services are coming to an end in the Americas.

The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

TSMC toto pro své partnery umí už dlouho.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Happy Home Paradise DLC is out following a surprisingly packed Animal Crossing-centric presentation last month. This paid DLC, which Nintendo says will be the last for New Horizons, offers players a chance to take up a new profession as a vacation home designer. The experience costs $24.99 on its own, but if you pick up a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Happy Home Paradise comes bundled in for no extra cost. So, is the design life worth the Bells?
With several hours, multiple happy vacation home clients, and even a promotion under my belt, my biggest takeaway is that this expansion holds little for you if you don’t love designing spaces. If you are drawn to Animal Crossing to gather museum displays or strike it rich in the Stalk Market, Happy Home Paradise might not be for y…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' impending release next year means not only will Borderlands fans have a new game to dive into, but they'll also have plenty of new merch to pick up and collect. Those who are partial to the Dungeons and Dragons-inspired Borderlands 2 DLC, Assault on Dragon Keep, and the expanded vision of that aesthetic in Wonderlands will have plenty to look forward to, such as this lovely piece available for pre-order now.
Mighty Jaxx is now taking pre-orders for the Tiny Tina & Butt Stallion (523 Edition) collectible. This "suuuper beautiful" 8" figurine depicts Tiny Tina decked out in her witchy regalia, riding on the back of the infamous diamond pony herself, Butt Stallion. In true Borderlands fashion, there's also plenty of loot that comes along with the purchase of this resin statue.

For the asking price of $199.99, you'll also receive a handful of additional items, including an Epic Games Store code to download Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, five character cards, two 4" Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Mighty Jaxx mini-figures, and 3,000 Mighty coins (a currency used through the loyalty program on the collectible maker's website). These bonus items won't come in the box with your fanciful statue, however. You'll have to verify your Tiny Tina & Butt Stallion figurine via a QR code through the Mighty Jaxx app to receive the game code, order the extra figures, and collect your coins. 
Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is scheduled for a March 25, 2022 release. While the game key provided with this figuring will only benefit PC users, the game will also be available for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.]]></summary>

As if anything could be scarier than the bit in the Disney version where the kids get turned into donkeys. But come, watch the trailer.

However, Hidetaka Miyazaki’s Bloodborne often sticks out to me the most. The Victorian architecture, gothic time period, and nightmare-inducing monster design are fascinating but haunting. Even a character as bubbly as Pinocchio couldn’t change Bloodborne’s moody atmosphere, and this couldn’t be any more evident in Lies of P, a soulslike with some serious visual inspirations from Bloodborne that chronicles the journey of a vicious, sword-wielding Pinocchio. 
No, I’m not making this up! Just take a peek at the gameplay teaser below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft's Netflix-like video game subscription service and its library continues to grow with each passing month. This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn't always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. 
Every now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. 
Things are going to get a bit...orange this week
November 8, 2021
This immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation's game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it's playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it's not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today's tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. 
But what if it's not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it's the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it's the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. 
Another famous "orange" in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. 
That's enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it's The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

"You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game."
Don't worry; I'm not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the "difficulty in games" debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can't answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

Endwalker is the next large-scale addition. The pandemic affected the fourth expansion’s production, and now producer and director Naoki Yoshida has announced a short two-week delay alongside a new Endwalker launch trailer (seen below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fittingly for Fireworks Night, Call Of Duty: Vanguard launched in the wee hours, bringing a great many big explosions as the first-person shooter series returns to World War 2 once again. Along with yer usual story campaign and multiplayer modes, it has Treyarch's Zombies too. Though I do suspect the part of Vanguard many want isn't out yet, and they won't even pay for: the new Pacific island map coming to CoD: Warzone at a later point.

Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.

Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn't it?

It's dark, it's tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we're leaving the Ancestor's squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they're excited to be working in early access again.

Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XCOM studio Firaxis have announced a delay for Marvel's Midnight Suns, their turn-based tactics game in the BAM! BIF! POW! world of Marvel superheroes. Previously due in March 2022, it's now pushed back into the second half of 2022. I say "previously"; the game was only announced two months ago. Sounds like someone had a serious rethink about the state of the project. But if it needs the time, it's good that it's getting the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is good, very good. I mean, we've slapped a Bestest Best badge on it, like one of its in-game sigils. What effect does it have? Play the game and you'll quickly realise it does things games aren't supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I'm actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn't realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reader dear, I have to ask: do you try to get 100% collectables in games? Someone must, because games still have them. But I certainly don't, and I don't think I've spoken about the subject with anyone who does. So, seeing as Psychonauts 2 has now released a patch with new features to help players collect every little doodad and tick off achievements, I want to ask: do you do this? Will you? Please tell me about it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'd think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you're still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don't be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

Blizzard had never stated a release date for either game anyway, we only had a vague hint that they didn't expect to launch them in 2021. Now, maybe 2023 at earliest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jen Oneal is stepping down as co-lead of Blizzard Entertainment, just three months after she took the position. Since J. Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who'll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she's not leaving because she's "without hope for Blizzard", but wants to "do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Card games are all the rage these days, so much so that even Yoko Taro of Nier: Automata fame is getting in on the action. Alas, if you’re expecting a similarly galaxy brain take on tabletop RPGs here, you’re going to be disappointed. Despite the creative minds behind it (Automata’s producer Yosuke Saito and composer Keiichi Okabe are also on board), Voice Of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a decidedly simple role playing affair where its titular cards are nothing more than a fancy visual layer papering over a by-the-book tale of dungeons and, yes, a dragon. Inscryption this ain’t.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a segment in a 2003 episode of radio series This American Life from 2003, in which a man named Dan Fitzsimons talks about a cable television channel he tried to launch in the '90s. It was the "Puppy Channel". A 24/7 broadcast of nothing but puppies. 

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new "Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos" category to the livestreaming platform.
