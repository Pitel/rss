        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arriving this September.
When Ark: Survival Evolved made its debut on the Nintendo Switch back in 2018, it was released in a pretty rough state. There was a range of technical issues and there were also some substantial slowdown issues.
Fortunately, the team at Studio Wildcard are looking to turn the situation around with Ark: Ultimate Survivor Edition - a 'complete revamp' of the game from a new port specialist, supposedly rebuilding the game's code in Unreal Engine 4 and enhancing the functionality, graphics and optimisation.

Square Enix is pumping out new (and old) RPGs on a regular basis - with games like The DioField Chronicle and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII to look forward to later this year. If these games weren't already exciting enough, it seems yet another classic could be getting a remaster.
As spotted by the Twitter account @asiangameprints (via Nintendo Everything), a listing has recently appeared on Play-Asia for SaGa Frontier 2 - originally released by Squaresoft on the PlayStation in 1999/2000. This includes a listing for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, with the "official release date" scheduled for next month on 25th August.

We're now in July, and there's still no sign of the second Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC wave, so what's going on? Although Nintendo hasn't provided an update about when this next wave will be delivered, it seems fans have been able to work out some sort of time frame for this next DLC release.
As shown in a tweet by @PushDustIn, a recent 7-Eleven advert in Japan shows the Wave 1 courses and the DLC waves to come. Up in the top-right though, it's mentioned how this ad should no longer be displayed to the public by 17th July 2022. It's led to theories that an announcement could potentially be just around the corner.

I'm a firm believer that co-op makes just about any game better (or at least more...

Skyrim Together Reborn lets you play Skyrim Special Edition (1.6) online with friends on Steam. Think of the RP potential!
Following its Friday debut on NexusMods and a weekend's worth of word-of-mouth, Skyrim Together Reborn is nearing 100,000 downloads. The mod community has been down this co-op road before, but Reborn represents a fresh start, and people are into it.
"The code has been rewritten from the ground up, since the old codebase was too messy to work with," according to the mod's creators…]]></summary>

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Iron & Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft came to me as a request from the fabulous Akeashar. I had never heard of it, but my local game shop had a copy in stock. As I browsed the rack of PS1 games, I couldn’t remember the name. I just knew it was ridiculous, and sure enough, I found it based on that fact alone.
I don’t know. Initially, I thought it might not be that bad. There’s a cheesy ‘90s CGI cutscene that seems to go on forever and doesn’t make much sense unless you read the story in the instruction manual, but the presentation seems like whoever made the UI maybe sort of cared. One of the characters is a werewolf, so that’s always a plus for me.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

When you think of Mario's best quotes, there's not much to pick from. "It's-a-me" and "woohoo" are not the kind of things you get engraved on your gravestone. Same with Luigi, Toad, Peach, and the whole Mushroom Kingdom cohort — it's all "wa-hoo" and "oh yeah". Hardly Shakespearean stuff, but it gives the games character, and often their short lines are so iconic that they become memes in their own right, like Waluigi's WAAAAAA.
But every now and again, Charles Martinet is forced to work hard for his money, speaking in full sentences in the pseudo-Italian accents of Mario, Luigi and friends — and kind Twitter archivist @Destructo_Dan has compiled many of the most egregious examples for us to enjoy.

We love Game Boy (and Game Boy-shaped) hardware mods around here, and this new project — a Game Boy "like no other" — is worth a look. Creator Obirux imagined what an original Game Boy with the GBA form factor might look like, and then got to work.
https://youtu.be/p3Tl4aOVnvo
This video is a snappy overview of the "landscape" Game Boy prototype, which was created with two Game Boy shells, other original Nintendo parts, and a modified DMG IPS kit — so the overall design is spot-on, and the games themselves look sharp, too.
As iconic as the original Game Boy looks and feels — and even with lots of fond memories coloring my perspective to this day — I'm sure my hands would get along so much better with this GBA-style handheld. There's a passionate market for custom handhelds, and I'll be curious to see if anyone else follows suit (or if this creator decides to offer a mod kit).
Here's a side-by-side shot with the original Game Boy and Obirux's landscape design:
[caption id="attachment_334362" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Nintendo fans would pay a pretty penny for this handheld.[/caption]
The design is a winning combo, but Obirux isn't currently selling "landscape" kits. That said, the London-based modder does have a shop with lots of neat modified handhelds.

"The retro gaming community keeps me buzzing and I can’t thank them enough for pushing tech and design to new and exciting levels," Obirux said on their website.
Whether it's a slow or fast gaming news day, projects like this give me life.

Developed by veteran studio KT Racing, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown certainly sounds like an incredibly meaty undertaking, with a host of highly realistic licensed vehicles burning rubber through what has been touted as a meticulous "1:1" recreation of the entirety of Hong Kong Island. An emphasis on customization will allow players to not only fine-tune their cars' appearances to perfection but also customize the appearance of the driver themselves — a feature that takes center stage in the new Solar Crown trailer.
First announced in the summer of 2020, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was originally expected to hit the streets this September, but became one of a litany of cross-gen releases pushed back to 2023. It was also confirmed that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the title had been canceled. Now over two years into its development, with a release scheduled for sometime in the coming 18 months, fans are becoming a tad antsy at the persistent rolling out of cinematic trailers, and are starting to wonder when they will finally get to see the ambitious-sounding racer in action.
Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

It has been 20 years since everybody's favorite Half-Genie Hero sashayed her way onto the Game Boy Color and into our hearts. From Pirate's Curses, to Risky's Revenges and even Seven Sirens, there's no denying that the magical gal and her fellow Scuttle Island denizens rank among the most likable, cheerful, and enduring characters of modern gaming.
To celebrate her 20th anniversary, boutique outlet Limited Run Games has opened pre-orders on this delightful statue. The figurine stands around 10 inches tall, (including the base), and spotlights shapeshifting adventurer in her classic genie garb and posed coyly at the viewer. There is no pajama Shantae variant, but we can't have everything.

As a fun addition, anybody who has been collecting the ongoing range of acrylic character standees will find that, once they are inserted into the base, that the statue lights up Shantae in all of her glory. It should be clearly stated that the acrylic figures are previous sale items and are NOT automatically included with the statue. An additional set of acrylics — depicting five Shantae game covers — are available in a bundle.
If you fancy a Shantae statue of your very own — and who wouldn't? — then she is available to pre-order now over at the official Limited Run Games store. The statue is $134.99 USD or $159.99 with the acrylic bundle, (not including shipping or any potential customs charges). Pre-orders will close on August 28, with the statue expected to ship in 2023.

Granted, the Nintendo Switch is not known for its ability to take super-realistic 4K screenshots (because it can't), but a good screenshot is not defined by how many pixels it has — it's defined by the memories it holds.

What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.
For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it. 
Yesterday, Twitter user Nors3 shared a screen capture of Liberation HD’s now-defunct Steam page, displaying a notice that states, "At the request of the pub…]]></summary>

Their latest Nintendo mobile game, Pikmin Bloom, came out in late 2021, and invited players to catch, raise, and manage a horde of Pikmin in an AR setting on their mobile phones. As of 11th July, Pikmin Bloom is getting a host of new features as part of its latest update, which includes new weekly challenges, friend invites, and the promise of physical events (US only).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Otherwise known as the Titanfall universe)
Job listings at Respawn Entertainment point to a "new single-player adventure" in development at the studio, and if you're a Titanfall fan who is also big into Apex Legends, you might be in luck. The posts describe an "Apex Universe FPS Incubation" project.
"This new single-player title is a developer’s dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits," according to a job listing for a senior environment artist spotted by Dexerto.
"Our critically acclaimed, multi-platform games have traditionally established a 'fun comes first' sensibility created with the notion that great ideas can come from anyone, which allows creativity to shine and individuals to shape the game in meaningful ways."
"Titanfall 3" will probably always be one of those what-if scenarios, so I'm curious if this game will try to scratch that itch at all or take a different direction in this universe. Apex Legends may have the masses, but the Titanfall name still means a lot to fans.
It's easy to let wishful thinking get the better of us, but it is exciting to think about a single-player FPS from Respawn, with or without major ties to Titanfall. This studio knows how to build a compelling campaign, and with so much energy invested in multiplayer shooters these days, some of us could really go for another solo joint. The key word here, "incubation," means we're in for a wait — assuming this game comes to fruition.
Respawn is also hiring an art director to work on a "new IP," which is also in the incubation phase. Between Apex Legends, new games, and Star Wars, busy times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["No additional download required"
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 dual audio will be part of the base game, Nintendo has revealed via a new tweet leading up to launch.
Sometimes on Nintendo consoles (read: not always) "language packs" are often used as a way to supplement a game's vocal options: optional downloads that you need to pick up, which can get annoying if you just want to pop in your physical cart and go. Well you can do just that, Nintendo says, at least if you're looking for English or Japanese voices.
The publisher posted a full one-minute video alongside the confirmation, splicing in the English cast with the Japanese one. You can hear pretty much everyone from the "core six" in action, and it's not even a major spoiler, as the clip has already been posted before (during the Nintendo Direct presentation for the game); and it's mostly a little traveling interlude with no major story implications.
This sort of dual audio at launch thing has become the norm for a lot of JRPGs, and I really dig it. I know some people can't stand a lot of the English voice acting for this series (I'm cool with it!), so the ability to swap immediately with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 dual audio will enhance a lot of people's experience quite a bit.

While there's no denying that Xbox is a hugely popular, globally recognized brand, it is well documented that Microsoft's hardware line struggles to find footing on Japanese soil, often trounced by local hero Sony PlayStation. It seems that Gen 9, however, is looking set to shake that precedent up, as the Xbox Series X/S console line appears to be going from strength to strength in regards to sales in Japan.
In recent data summarized by Famitsu and analyst @Benjisales Xbox Series X/S has sold somewhere in the region of 260,500 consoles since its launch in the fall of 2020, that's already over double the lifetime sales of Gen 8 hardware Xbox One, which sold just under 115,000 units in Japan over the course of its production run. This new data comes h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long been on the "eh, seems okay" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It's a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it's a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

We all know how incredible the GameCube controller is, right? Heck, there's a reason so many people still prefer to use it for franchises such as Super Smash Bros.; it's awesome. If you've seen the prototype design of the controller, however, then you'll know that the early design was uhh... different? No, that's not the right word... Awful, there we go.
It's odd, because in terms of form factor, there's little that's actually changed from the prototype to the final retail product, but one glance will tell you that small changes can make a tonne of difference. Take the width, for example: you can see that the prototype controller is significantly wider than the retail model, with a more prominent gap between the d-pad and the c-stick. In addition, the handles either side are more pronounced, making the prototype look more like a boomerang than the controller we all know and love.

For nearly a full hour the duo hyped up the recent addition of Jane Foster, as they discussed the game as a whole. But during some downtime between mission launches, Techniq gave us a bit of extra info: seemingly going off-script to announce that She-Hulk would arrive at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

There are fan-favorite franchises that are far worse off, but we can count our victories while still screaming at the walls about what is left to be done.
Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series can be counted as a victory. It collects remastered versions of the Wii remake of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, and the PS2 sequel, Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil into one package.

Let’s get it out of the way. FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch on the Nintendo Switch is a frustrating game. Not in the sense that it’s difficult, but rather that it is so frustratingly close to being something great and doesn't quite make it. Like doing a pole vault and you crack your ankle on the pole. There’s a lot of good stuff in here, but a mixture of the game falling short of its potential and the Switch hardware struggling to keep up makes this one a bit harder to recommend.
Developed by Shanghai-based TiGames in conjunction with Sony’s ‘China Hero Project’ initiative, FIST launched on PlayStation consoles and PC in 2021 before now making its way to Switch almost a year later. It's a dieselpunk Metroidvania in which you assume the role of an anthropomorphic rabbit named Rayton; a former pilot who has to take up 'arm' to fight back against the legion and their elite squadron, the Iron Dogs, who have occupied his home of Torch City. The arm in question quite literally being a giant arm that straps to Ray’s back — the eponymous FIST.

That original game is already available on Switch, of course, and we called it "an incredible porting job" in our review — we're hoping Black Isle delivers something of similar quality this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You get the Rabbid one I guess
Rabbid Rosalina is in for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, but the "real" Rosalina likely isn't, according to a new developer interview.
Producer Xavier Manzanares spoke to Nintendo Everything about the game, and dropped at least one confirmation bomb on us: that Yoshi was 100% out for Sparks of Hope. Manzanares posits: "When we started to think about the team and the heroes, we didn’t want to go for, ‘Okay, we did it before, so we have to do the same thing again’ and trying to evolve what we had in Kingdom Battle. So it’s true as well for the heroes."
Instead, they "decided early" to adopt the framework of nine heroes. Since the game is "not a direct sequel," they had a bit of leeway here, and chose characters based on archetypes, so that they could balance the gameplay around them. "Edge," the game's big original character, was born out of this concept, as were Rabbid Rosalina and Bowser. Manzanares says the reaction to Rabbid Rosalina has made the team "super happy," and refrains from confirming a "real" version of her (but does reconfirm Rabbid Mario, Rabbid Luigi, and Rabbid Peach).
Of course, there's still a chance that Rosalina could appear as an unlockable character, and that Sparks of Hope has some tricks (or DLC) up its sleeve. But for now, I wouldn't count on it, as the current confirmed roster is looking pretty full.
Here's a confirmation of all the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope characters so far:
Mario
Rabbid Mario
Luigi
Rabbid Luigi
Peach
Rabbid Peach
Rabbid Rosalina
Bowser
Edge (newcomer/original character)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say hello to GameTraderZero's 'Clicky Mod'.
While we've seen plenty of pretenders to the throne, many Switch fans are of the opinion that the official Pro Controller is still the best pad to use when you're playing on the TV or in tabletop mode. It's comfortable, has a good D-Pad and offers the full range of features – motion control, HD Rumble and NFC support – some of which are often lacking in third-party alternatives.
However, GameTraderZero – a company whose efforts we've covered in the past – thinks it has achieved the impossible and actually improved the stock Pro Controller. The firm has taken the standard pad and hand-soldered tactile button switches beneath the ABXY / LR buttons and the digital pad, providing an experience which certainly sounds different during gameplay. Furthermore, GameTraderZero has given the pad's ZL and ZR shoulder buttons 'hair triggers', so they emit a pleasant clicking sound when pressed.

At the start of July, the publisher shared 15 getting-on-a-bit games they intended to shut down online services for, including access to bought DLC. Now, Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD, Space Junkies and Silent Hunter 5 have already been delisted from Steam at Ubisoft’s request, and won't be accessible from September 1st.

The latest charts are in and this week sees a couple of noteworthy changes. First off, KLONOA: Phantasy Reverie Series debuts at the half way point at number 5, with Switch making up more than half of its total sales. It's a reasonably strong start for the 2.5D platformer and although we've yet to publish our own thoughts on the remake, you can check out a bunch of other reviews right here.
Elsewhere, as expected, Mario Strikers: Battle League Football has fallen out of the top 10 to come in at number 11. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, meanwhile, has fallen even further this week to land at number 27. Yikes.

Rumours of a GoldenEye 007 port or remaster have been circulating around the industry for quite some time now. After users spotted achievements for the game on Xbox, it was understandably assumed that the launch would be close, with some optimistic fans half-expecting a shadow drop during June's Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase.
Alas, it wasn't to be. No mention of the game's release has been uttered by Rare, Nintendo, or Microsoft and it's now believed that the game may currently be in limbo due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As reported by our sister-site Pure Xbox, this comes via a recent tweet from reporter Jeff Grubb who unreservedly stated that the game is "in limbo because of the war".

At the Apex Legends Global Series 2022 competition - which offers up an incredible $2 million grand prize, by the way - professional gamer Philip "ImperialHal" Dosen shot to headlines for showing restraint during a match in which a competitor player crashed. When roaming about the map, Dosen spotted the lone player whose avatar remained static, signifying that whoever was controlling it must have crashed or disconnected during the match.
As reported by Eurogamer, instead of bagging the cheap kill, Dosen quickly realised that the player had crashed and chose to refrain from shooting, stating into the microphone to his teammates "Dont shoot him. Don't shoot him, bro! He's crashed, do not shoot him. He's 100% tapped out or crashed or something".

When Nintendo launched the novel yet ultimately ill-fated Labo sets for the Nintendo Switch, it opened our minds as to what other concepts might be invented for the little hybrid console that could.
Now, thanks to Sydney-based design company Alquemy, we've been given a unique glimpse into a concept that completely changes the Switch from a gaming console to a DJ platform. Essentially, by taking the design elements from the Akai Pro MPC line-up, Alquemy has designed detachable modules that would slide onto the Switch console - much like the Joy-Con controllers we know and love (??) - complete with everything you would need to control music playback. You've got loads of buttons, knobs, switches, a couple of speakers, and of course the touch screen provided by the Switch itself. Quality of life additions include backlit keys and a range of ports for connecting guitars, headphones, and more.

If you remember a little while back, we reported on a rather ambitious indie developer from Australia who's looking to bring seven new titles to the Wii U and 3DS, defying the upcoming eShop closure. One of those games is about to come to fruition, as Silver Falls: Ghoul Busters will be launching on the Nintendo 3DS on July 14th in the US, with release dates in Europe and Australia to follow soon. The game follows Silver Falls: 3 Down Stars, which launched back in January 2020 to middling reviews.
Although it sounds remarkably similar to a small 1984 movie starring up and comers Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver, Silver Falls: Ghoul Busters is an homage to classic 2D platformers and is said to boast tightly designed levels that will provide a solid challenge for all gamers.

Naming characters is a notoriously difficult part of writing fiction, but for my six-year-old son, it's apparently pretty easy, at least when it comes to Pokémon. We looked through a catalog of Pokémon Vivid Voltage cards a few days ago, and much to my surprise, he spontaneously renamed 150+ Pokémon. He actually didn't have much of a choice, because he's a little too young to read on his own. I suppose he could have forced me to read through the book for him, but that would have been pretty boring for both of us. Instead, he did it his own way, and I know I'm biased, but I think the results are pretty adorable, even when (or especially when?) they veer into bizarre potty humor territory.

Picasso once said that it took him a lifetime to learn to paint like a child.
Freeing your brain of self-criticism and the need to do things the "correct" way ain't easy, but it's the only way you're ever going to come up with new Pokémon names like Cocoon Butler and Jiggly Horror. Let's hope my kid stays young and wild long enough to get a few more of these videos out before the cold hand of teenage self-consciousness squeezes the innocence out of his heart like a sponge.

With this in mind, Respawn appears to be developing a new solo first-person shooter adventure set in the Apex Legends universe. It's again kind of big news considering the popularity of the battle royale game.

Like always, we're focusing on download-only games that we've reviewed, and that DLC and expansions — like Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak and Cuphead - The Delicious Last Course — aren't included. But even with those ground rules laid down, it was still a corker of a month on the eShop.

There are tons of mods that can help with quality-of-life stuff, or just help you straight-up cheat, like the Item Spawner or NPC Map Locations mods, but if you really want to make Stardew Valley feel brand new in look or feel, we've compiled a list of some of the best content and reskin mods for the game out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's Shmup, Doc?
It's c-c-c-cute-'em-up time in the Arcade Archives! This week's offering from the retro lovers over at Hamster Corporation is certainly something of shmup oddity: Bally Midway's Rabio Lepus, which is available to download right now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Launching in the coin-op market in 1987, Rabio Lepus (also known in international territories as Rabbit Punch) is an early entry in the cute-'em-up subgenre and is considered an early precursor to Midway's highly popular '90s franchise Sonic Wings. Rabio Lepus is a high-fantasy adventure that sees two robo-rabbit vessels, (the titular "Rabio & Lepus"), jet into battle on a brave mission to rescue the land's ruler, King Kitashirakawa, and his two bunny girl daughters, Komomo & Kotomi, from a nefarious alien force.
Check out the adorable rescue mission in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber ShiryuGL.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyFp3CwZqcg
Like most titles in the genre, Rabbit Punch features large, colorful sprites battlings on equally colorful sci-fi horizons, taking on wave after wave of non-sequitur enemies including golem warriors, metallic cats, demonic elements, and giant demon head with a worm for a tongue. As you might have noticed, this entry isn't quite as cartoonish as Konami's Parodius or NMK's Hacha Mecha Fighter, but it still holds its own in the field of odd design. The international edition of the game removes the bunny girl princesses entirely. Spoilsports.
Rabio Lepus would find its way onto the home market in the form of 1990 PC Engine revamp Rabio Lepus Special, which sports expanded gameplay, new modes, enemies, and weapons. When Bally Midway's Sonic Wings series finally took flight, our long-eared heroes, (and the princesses), were not forgotten, making several cameo appearances in tribute to the franchise's humble origins.
Rabio Lepus is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

One of the tricky optional goals in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is to "obtain great power," and it's tied to a mysterious Cursed Relic that puts a tough new spin on the boss-battling format. While I struggled a bunch with this challenge, in the end, it ended up being one of the highlights of the DLC, and really, the entire base game. It makes you work.
Before I go into too many specifics, it's worth taking a broader approach for anyone who's intrigued but will ultimately still want to figure things out on their own. I'll ease you in.

Final Fantasy VII Remake may stray from the original in some notable ways, but it also has a lot of love for its predecessor. One piece of evidence is the inclusion of Leviathan as one of the few summons that made it into Final Fantasy VII Remake.
Square Enix has been running a series of blog posts going over the remake's development, with the latest posted today. And in response to a question about Final Fantasy VII Remake's Summoning Materia, co-director Naoki Hamaguchi explains why Leviathan specifically made the cut.
"At an early stage of development, we looked over the line-up of summons in the original FFVII and decided to go with Ifrit, Chocobo and Moogle, Shiva, Fat Chocobo, Leviathan and Bahamut, for a roster of 6," said Hamaguchi. "The r…]]></summary>

If you follow any account tangentially related to Final Fantasy or the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, you may have seen some recent ruckus about a billboard. Maybe about role-players, nightclubs, or a wall of cat-girls.
It's been a heck of a few days in the world of Final Fantasy XIV. But for those who maybe don't play, or aren't so plugged into the community, we've put together an explainer of what is going on with that billboard.
Much ado about a billboard
As best we can track back, it starts with an event being held in-game by Rain Nightclub. Player housing in Final Fantasy XIV is very customizable, allowing players and Free Companies (XIV's guilds) to design all kinds of cool locales. These range from simple homes to full-on aquariums and yes, nightclubs, where …]]></summary>

As we inch closer to launch day on July 19, one of the most fun games to think about right now is Stray, an adventure game about being a cat in a futuristic world run by robots. The trophy list is now out in the wild (courtesy of sites like Exophase and Powerpyx), and some of the descriptions give us a better idea of what to expect from Stray's scope.
Most notably, there's a pacifist challenge, one for meowing 100 times, another for being sneaky enough to go undetected, and a speedrun trophy for finishing the game in under two hours. From everything we've seen of Stray so far, I'm not surprised that it can be completed so quickly — and to be honest, that actually sounds wonderful.

It’s hard not to look back at Konami’s Famicom days and not get a little misty-eyed about how it used to be a fun company before the soul was sold out from under it by the corporate powers. It’s even harder once you look at Wai Wai World 2. Playing the game is like finding a horse murderer’s photo album and discovering it’s full of colorful pictures of ponies. It’s all wide-eyed and cute until you realize, “These were their first victims.”
The original Wai Wai World was a blast, just not a very big blast. It did its job bringing together a bunch of awesome Konami characters but did so into a clunky game full of annoyances. If you can believe it Wai Wai World 2 does the same thing, but with only one real annoyance: Upa. But then, babies ruin absolutely everything.

Long-running developer/publisher Tate Multimedia has announced that it is expanding its operations to include third-party publishing. The Polish company has previously only published titles within its own catalog, but is now looking to branch out into carrying other studios' wares.
"We know the ups and downs and understand the challenges on both sides of the developer-publisher relationship," Tate Multimedia VP Paul Leskowicz in a press release. "This makes working with third parties the logical next step, and we are excited to share our expertise with studios in the months and years to come. We know how important both retaining ownership of an IP and cash flow is for an indie studio and we want to make sure our collaborative approach and financial commitment give clear visibility and comfort to our partners in that regard."

Founded in 2000, Tate Multimedia is perhaps best known for its 3D adventure series Kao the Kangaroo. Just last month, the studio released a long-in-development sequel, which sees the antipodean hero traveling the world on a quest to rescue his sister while honing his fighting skills. Despite its somewhat under-the-radar presence, our own Chris Carter found it to be a solid, charismatic, and entertaining entry to the ever-popular mascot platformer genre.
Kao the Kangaroo is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

For the time being that may not change; as Blizzard is giving us a heads-up that Heroes of the Storm will remain online in the future, but doesn't promise anything big.
Here's the full, far-too-brief statement:
Moving forward we will support Heroes in a manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It Takes Two to make a thing go right
It Takes Two was one of the best surprises of last year. I'm a strong believer that we just don't have enough couch co-op games out there, and gamers' outpouring of love for It Takes Two confirms that. There are plenty of good reasons why it took home Game of the Year at the 2021's Game Awards, and I think it's great to see such creative titles get the recognition it deserves. It Takes Two has continued to be successful after last year's award season, because this morning, developer Hazelight Studios announced that the game had surpassed 7 million copies sold.
https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1545422823899922437
The studio celebrated with a tweet that featured a picture of Cody's voice actor Joseph Balderrama and what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Cutie the elephant. Although Balderrama is lifting Cutie over his head, we're assured in the replies that nothing untoward is happening... sure, I'll believe that when I see it.
It Takes Two is one of the next games up in the long line of film and television adaptations, and we learned a few months ago that the upcoming movie based on the game will be produced by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Or, more specifically, it's being produced by Seven Bucks Productions, a studio founded by Johnson and Dany Garcia. Still no word on a cast or release date, but it at least gives us something to look forward to. Some fans are hoping for a sequel to the game as well, and I have to admit that "It Takes Two 2" is a pretty funny idea for a title.
Big congrats again to the team behind It Takes Two, because 7 million copies sold is no small feat. Here's hoping that the game continues to have success in the future, and that Hazelight channels this momentum into another great release in the coming years.

The games are Ancient Enemy and Killing Floor 2, and it's the latter that triggered the memory trip for me - because it was also free on Epic this week two years ago. But hey, if you missed it, the zombie shooter still one of the best co-op games, so grab it while you can.

Sony's 2000 cinematic adventure game Aconcagua is getting an English patch. Though it only ever released in Japan, an English fan translation is making the game available for new audiences on July 11.
Hilltop, which has worked on translations of other games like Squaresoft's Japan-only street racing RPG Racing Lagoon, is publishing the English patch for Aconcagua.
This Sony release is pretty obscure; I'll be honest, I hadn't heard of it until this translation announcement. It received a 29/40 from Famitsu at the time, which isn't exactly a rave review.
That said, it's more about the curiosity of it. As you can see in the trailer, Aconcagua is a narrative adventure, blending action scenes with exploration and cinematic moments. The …]]></summary>

Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, "fun" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.]]></summary>

Back in February I looked at the situation again and Linux started outrunning Windows 11 on the i9-12900K with the latest Linux kernel at the time.

First someone got FSR 2.0 working in Cyberpunk 2077, then someone modded the Cyberpunk mod to get FSR in Dying Light 2, and then someone discovered the mod of the mod could also mod Metro Exodus. Now, redditor Muddymind has figured out how to tweak the Metro mod so that it can act as an Nvidia DLAA clone, skipping the upscaling bit to solely provide better image quality and anti-aliasing.

Schim was one I failed to spot entirely, despite our Ed placing it among the best games he played at the event in LA. It's a bouncy puzzle adventure about a frog-like creature who lives in shadows, and there's a new trailer below.

So much so, I thought it was a homage to Bloodborne's best bits. And at today's Nacon Connect, developers Spiders unveiled a new trailer which shows ballerina-turned-bodyguard Aegis fight off some metallic monstrosities, mixed in with a bit of parkour. Seriously, I'm excited for this one.

Appeal Studios’ Gangs Of Sherwood is an upcoming third-person PvE co-op action game that puts you in the dainty shoes of the Merry Men. This time though, it’s set in a dystopian future instead of Ye Merry Olde England. Watch the announcement teaser below to see what you think of that.

He hops between some bushes, dodges a dragon, and chucks something at an orc - all the staples of a Hobbit who's gone goblin mode. I'm still a bit on the fence about it, though.

Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it'll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

Ubisoft's pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SK Hynix are one of the biggest memory and flash storage manufacturers in the world, and after many years of mostly supplying the 'raw materials' like NAND and controllers to other people, they're now starting to make their own SSDs under their own brand name. Consequently, their stuff is often very competitive on price, and today we have a new low water mark for their P41 SSD thanks to a 15% off coupon at Amazon US. 
The massive 2TB model is now going for $221, down from $260, which is the lowest price we can find on a ~7000MB/s NVMe SSD of this capacity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games has released a new story trailer for The Devil In Me, the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today's new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes. 
Check out the new story trailer for The Devil In Me below:

Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.” 

This set is notable for Lego, too, because it utilizes newly-created Lego elements to recreate the look of Bowser’s iconic back spikes. Plus, it featur…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-07T12:17:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

That might seem far from the Tour De France but grown-up cyclists are just as keen on customising their bikes for coolness, and even some Tour bikes are rocking garish decoration this year.

According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn't mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I've returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I've learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.

More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway.

Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I'm not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold's new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that's right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it's quite possibly the strangest game you'll play all year.

I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It's Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.]]></summary>

Honestly, look at it. For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …]]></summary>

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

Maybe some twigs banging off a discarded Tesco trolley, creating a beautiful tune. No, I'm convinced it was the dulcet tones of Kiryu singing "Dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo!", as a signal from the nether that Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 would be back on Game Pass having been removed last year.

It's a puzzle-o-rama firing up a mysterious old computer to download pirated software from a BBS, letting us play everything from logic puzzles of circuits and flesh to a model kit-building simulation. I've played a wee bit and am keen to explore more, even as someone who is the absolute worst at Zachlikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who's played one of Firaxis' XCOM games in the last ten years will have a story about missed shots. Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder," he says.

Not to mention it's set in the 80's with a synthwave backing track. I'm sold.

It's the sequel to the biggest hero shooter out there! This time, this time we'd feel the "2" part come alive beneath our fingertips as we insta-locked Torbjorn on attack.
Dear reader, Liam and I emerged from our Overwatch 2 session having had a marvellous chat. We caught up on life, talked about Monster Hunter Rise, and how nice it is that the RPS Treehouse is complete again. Everything except Overwatch 2 itself was discussed... Which says it all, really.

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje.

Netflix just posted the intro to the upcoming Cyberpunk anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and it's got a Franz Ferdinand track over the top - but hey, it's still pretty good.

Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…]]></summary>

It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

I cycled home from seeing pals last night in a downpour and that's one of my favourite feelings in this world. Still, better stay indoors and dry off, maybe play some video games.

Quentin Tarantino recently asked the court to dismiss the case because he still owns the rights to the screenplay.

        <id>118727</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/01/new-cult-of-the-lamb-trailer-highlights-best-practices-for-keeping-your-cult-happy"/>
        <updated>2022-07-01T18:59:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

Across three weeks, 176 cyclists will ride 3328 kilometres (2068 miles) winding through France, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland, including the Alps and Pyrenees. As a keen cyclist and avid Tour watcher myself, I'm excited. So in celebration, over the coming weeks I'll be gabbing about the Tour De France, cycling, and bikes in a wide variety of video games with my own Tour De Jeux, from big-budget open-world extravaganzas to cute wee indie adventures.

Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!

Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.]]></summary>

The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

I've nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a "punker granny" or a "famous streamer" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.]]></summary>

Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version. 
In a Halo Waypoint blog post, 343 lead software engineer Isaac Bender and lead world designer John Mulkey discussed the co-op mode’s feat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll soon have the chance to play EA's highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this "insider" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title "Still working on it." The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it's going to be a blast.]]></summary>

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…]]></summary>

There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

June 30, 2022
In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, "You will die here, and I will live forever." We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, "Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else."
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>
