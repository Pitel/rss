Ah, the 3D platformer.

And also, we definitely don't just want to join the pile-on of hate aimed at Game Freak right now, even though they're probably doing fine with a record-breaking 10 million copies of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold in a matter of days.
But even though we can't provide concrete reasons for the game being broken, or solutions to the problems, we do have a few ideas and hopes for the future of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet — so we've made a list of 30 changes, fixes, and additions that we'd be happy to see in an update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Snorlaxes were harmed in the creation of this post.
Sometimes, when a new Pokémon game nears, questions loom. Pokémon are mysterious creatures. Where do they come from? What are their natures? Why do professors send children out into the world on unpaid scientific internships and have them participate in illicit, unethical animal fights?
Well, instead of doing that last part, here at Destructoid we usually turn to Occams for answers about Pokémon instead, via the encyclopedic Occamsdex. It's better than getting arrested for unpaid child labor and/or creating a new Micheal Vick.
And thus, we asked the Destructoid community to submit Pokémon for his judgment once more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

This week is a very special one for the retro purveyors over at Hamster Corp, this week sees the publisher hit 300 consecutive weeks of console releases, having rolled out almost six years' worth of golden oldies to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range. And, befitting the importance of the occasion, the publisher is taking it right back to the 1970s, with a rerelease of Namco's first major smash hit, Galaxian.
Released to the burgeoning arcade market in 1979, Galaxian was Namco's effort to capitalize on the earth-shattering success of Taito's 1978 release, Space Invaders. Following a similar formula, Galaxian has the player control a space vessel at the foot of the screen, taking on patterns of enemies that form in concurrent lines across the top of the screen.

After last week's release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you might have thought that it would have been a slightly quieter one for Nintendo Life this time around - well think again!
To say that it has been a week of Pokémon would be an understatement. We have discussed the games' best new 'mon designs, noted 30 things that you might have missed, gave our thoughts on how the games' open world might be improved and published guides on just about everything that you could possibly want to know - all aboard the Pikachoochoo train!

The ninth-generation games Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have been out for a week now. They take the series in a bold new direction with open-world design but also suffer from serious performance issues and glitches.
It seems for some trainers, all of this (including Game Freak's silence) has become too much, with many now requesting refunds. According to a story on VGC, players are having "mixed results" requesting Switch eShop refunds, but there are seemingly some success stories.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…]]></summary>

One of the new features in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet is that there are certain Pokémon who will only level up once you've walked 1,000 steps with them. That doesn't sound too bad, does it? Unfortunately, it's worse than it seems, because it requires having that Pokémon out of its ball, and walking around with it... and our Pokémon have a tendency to either stop moving completely, or jumping back into their ball whenever they feel like it. It's a nightmare.
But smart Pokémon players are here to save the day, because it turns out that all you need to do is just hop on top of a Pokémon Center's roof, and your Pokémon will run around like headless Torchics trying to catch up to you.

Will Genshin Impact's upcoming Genius Invokation TCG buck that trend? 
Probably not, no, but we'll know for sure when the Version 3.3 update lands on December 7th. There's also a new quest that takes place after the game's main storyline, a couple new playable characters, and a Breakout mini-game. Ah. I do actually quite like Breakout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s getting to the time in winter when we reflect on the year, and pick our Bestest Best games that we’ve played over the past twelve months (okay eleven months, but December is always kinda quiet). We recently had this chat in the RPS hive-mind, and going through each month and making note of my favourite releases completely shocked me with how many fantastic mystery games have come out this year. It’s honestly awesome. 
I’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it.

Out today after two years of development, the ambitious mod promises 3-4 hours of barrel-chucking, window-breaking, train-dodging, combine-blasting fun.  
Perhaps the full package will pale in comparison to Valve's polish, but the bit in this trailer where the player scurries down a train while contorting around manhacks looks oh-so appetisingly transportative. I think it's time I dug out my lighthouses.

Every time, nada, at least in the UK. Only now, during Black Friday proper, has its price dropped – and damned far too, with Amazon chopping £70 off the RRP to bring our top wireless gaming mouse pick down to just £50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Nidhogg is like playing a dozen frantic games of rock-paper-scissors back to back. Like all the best couch co-op games, it's very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent's guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.
Oh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running. Fair enough, I suppose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that's a whopper.
One of the very best new features introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is undoubtedly the sandwich making mini-game. Accessed when you set up picnics in the region of Paldea, the game allows you to stack up your very own sandwich using a bevy of incredients including cheese, tofu, onion, bacon, and more. Creating sandwiches will offer up various buffs depending on which ingredients you choose, and as you progress through the game, more and more different ingredients will be made available to you.
What's even more impressive, however, is that fact that building up your sandwich is actually really good fun! If nothing else, it's a great little distraction from the multitude of bugs that have plagued the main game since its release. Some players have even taken things one step further by creating their own little game in which you stack a whole bunch of bacon into a "tower" before it all collaspes.

It's not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it'd be unfair and untrue to say it's because there aren't enough good ones. It's more that I don't have much room for new ones.

Lilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I'd call a vibes-based game.

Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my journey into the depths of TikTok's dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that's now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It's been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called "dabloons" cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It's as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

We've finally been given a date for the next Disney Dreamlight Valley update, and it's pretty soon — December 6th!
The game, which is still in early access, has a long way to go before it can be a full release, with all the content required to make it feel busy and lively, plus the promised free-to-play mechanics (whether you want them or not). And, of course, the developers at Gameloft are steadily fixing a lot of bugs, glitches, and other issues that players have been reporting over the past couple of months of early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...]]></summary>

The game's arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It's pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday's appropriately titled "The Tiny One" update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

The ever expanding multiverse that is the MCU has been no stranger to a Nintendo reference in the past. There was the Wii and GameCube nod in WandaVision, Kamala and her pals playing Smash Bros. in Ms. Marvel and even a little bit of Switch in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. But the latest addition to the franchise - Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special - takes it to a whole new level, showing the joy that some retro Nintendo goodness can bring at Christmas time (thanks, Time Extension).
We won't go too deep into the details here for fear of alerting the TVA to our timeline on charges of spoilers, but we will need to do some description of what happens in the scene. So if you really don't want to see anything about the Guardians' latest adventure, maybe skip the following until you have watched it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Black Friday means another opportunity for the Logitech G502 Hero - RPS readers' most favouritest gaming mouse - to get nice and cheap. This button-rich desk rodent is a particularly common sight during big PC hardware sales like Black Friday, but it's hard to tire of seeing when it's one of the best gaming mice ever made, and I actually prefer it to the recent G502 X refresh - especially when it's 56% off. That's precisely 56% off in both the UK and US, too.


Alright, technically it's the Logitech G502 Hero SE (Special Edition) that has the best available price in the UK; the standard model is £5 more for some reason. But the only difference between this and the all-black G502 Hero is the addition of some white highlights, so otherwise they share the same comfortable shape, highly customisable 11-button layout, and sharp 25,600dpi sensor.

Not only is that a big, meaty chunk of cash to carve off, it’s also an outstandingly low price for a gaming laptop with the RTX 3070 specifically. I’ve seen this high-end GPU in a few other laptops that are up for Black Friday sales, but they’re tending more towards the £1100 mark. In terms of getting the most graphical power for the least money, then, the Katana GF66 is unlikely be beaten today. Even by the RTX 3080 laptop for £1200 deal that's still going.

This time around, the collection contains Armarogue, Ceruledge, an adorable Pawmi and Smoliv as well as a selection of gym leaders. Check out the full range below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming December 2022.
While perhaps not quite as polished as it appeared on other platforms, Sifu's Switch debut really knew how to deal out the hits when it arrived on the console earlier this month. Fortunately, Sloclap isn't pulling any punches with keeping the game up to scratch as it has announced that the Fall Title Update will be coming in December.
Based on the team's announcement tweet (which doesn't specify any consoles at the moment, so we are assuming the Switch's inclusion), it seems that the biggest add-on coming to the game will be the addition of the replay editor. Sifu's combat is smooth - real smooth - and this new tool looks to help us with making those clips extra cinematic. Like Park Chan-wook himself on the set of Oldboy, you will be able to follow the hero along corridors with your camera, focusing on certain hits and pulling back on others - cinema!

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

However, that is slowly changing, with Black Friday Eve bringing a new low price on the high-end CPU: £475, down from a launch RRP of £600. That's a tidy £125 discount and a great price for one of the fastest consumer CPUs money can buy.

Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen.

That's pretty much it in terms of this week. Things will start picking up a little more as we head into the holiday season, and things quiet down in mid-December or so.

There’s loads more Morrowind in 2022 than I could’ve imagined as a teenager though, as the Tamriel Rebuilt mod project has been working for decades to add other areas of the Elder Scrolls’ provincial mainland into the game. Their latest release, 22.11, landed this week, adding a huge one-two punch of expansions. You can see some of one of those, Dominions Of Dust, in the trailer below.

SNK has offered up more information pertaining to the second season of its excellent team-scrapper The King of Fighters XV — From January 2023, new characters, modes, and under-the-hood tech tweaks will begin a steady rollout across all platforms, bringing further excitement to one of the long-running franchise's best-ever entries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCsTzOoWZZ0
Season 2 starts with the dawning of the new year, bringing with it a brand new character balance update and the first DLC fighter of season 2: Kyo Kusanagi fanboy and good-hearted goof Shingo Yabuki. As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.
In addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll have heard by now that Pentiment is bloody good. It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).
In the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.

Anywhoo, 'tis Thanksgiving, or Friendsgiving, or Turkey Day, or even Turkee Day (for my vegan pals).

The original platform's .com domain was retired many years ago after its operators felt Hollywood breathing down their necks. That doesn't mean their old domain is worthless though. The Putlocker brand remains popular and just recently the putlocker.com domain sold at auction for more than $100k.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult fighter to receive major upgrade
SNK's fab and precise fighting title Samurai Shodown is currently preparing to make a comeback, bolstered by the power of some slick new rollback netcode. The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title's new functionality.
The beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter's online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.
The arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho's devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here's hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.
Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

US newspaper Politico report that three anonymous sources with knowledge of the potential antitrust lawsuit have claimed it could happen in December, although any such lawsuit isn't guaranteed. The four FTC commissioners haven’t voted to decide on a complaint yet, and haven’t met with Microsoft or Activision Blizzard lawyers, two of the sources said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands.

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh look at what Dead Island 2 has been up to
Dead Island 2 is rising from the beyond to share more of what the team's been working on. A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.
The stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.
https://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1595462356230115329
What's the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of "action, gore, and zombies." Hopefully we get to see some details of what's in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.
Rising from the grave
It's at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it's been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.
“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”
More delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It's just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.
We'll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.

I've practised build orders, memorised specific civ counters, watched pro matches and agonised over key bindings. I have gone down into the nitty gritty of sheep micro, just to shear off microseconds from early villager gathering times, but I've never seen a good reason to build half of the landmarks in the game. It's a blessed relief, therefore, to see "landmark improvements" on the roadmap for Season 4, alongside a new mode and a funky purple-looking biome.

I’ll be upfront here; I like Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. They move the series forward in several important ways, and there are moments here that are the highest highs of the franchise’s history. Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are also ridiculously buggy. The performance issues are so rampant that they will impact your experience, regardless of your tolerance for low framerates. This is unacceptable for the largest multimedia franchise on the planet.
But you know what? I've had some hearty laughs encountering glitches in this game. There are so many weird, unpredictable oddities in Scarlet & Violet that I almost look forward to discovering them. In a perfect world, Game Freak would have intentionally made Pokemon do weird stuff in the background just for the player’s amusement. …]]></summary>

Ragnarok has come and gone for the God of War series. And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.
In a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he's asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.
"I don't know man, that game is big," said Williams. "I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn't count on it."
While there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn't too surprising. God of War (2018) didn't receive any extra DLC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJ4Km46A-0
Patience, boy
I haven't rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it's a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I'd be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.
Ragnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.
What could those projects be? Well, in the Kinda Funny spoilercast, Williams does mention he'd love to make a Castlevania game. It'd be a sight to see if that collaboration ever does work out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running with the pack
NetEase Games has made a "strategic investment" in the up-and-coming Polish studio Rebel Wolves. The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.
"We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. "Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development."
This "world-class AAA game" is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team's strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title's release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.
NetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.
Despite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.

Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn't the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company's right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.
"Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve," said Office Create at the time. "Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.
"Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create's approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create's approval."
Following this week's legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves. To date, the most recent official Cooking Mama release was Apple Arcade title Cooking Mama: Cuisine! which launched in July of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End of line for Onoma
Square Enix Montreal, which recently changed its name to Onoma, has announced that it is to shut down service for four of its mobile titles. The quartet of games will officially end service on January 4, 2023, ahead of the studio's announced closure.
Hitman Sniper: The Shadows; Deus EX GO; Arena Battle Champions; and Space Invaders: Hidden Heroes will be removed from the iOS App Store and the Android Store on December 1. Additionally, all in-game purchases have been suspended. On January 4, all four titles will be rendered unplayable. No refunds will be issued for the initial game purchase or any DLC downloads.
https://twitter.com/StudioOnoma/status/1595185541875748864?s=20&t=ewt1z8CoqL038UFXRPuhGw
Square Enix Montreal, founded back in 2011, was mostly focused on the creation of mobile and free-to-play titles, finding a small but dedicated audience with its GO strategy series, which utilized famous IPs such as Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex. The studio was picked up earlier this year as part of a transaction that saw holding company Embracer Group acquire much of Square Enix' western subsidiaries, including studios Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, along with their respective IPs.
Soon after, it was announced that Square Enix Montreal was rebranding as Onoma, which appeared to signal a new lease of life for the company. However, in a shocking turn of events, the studio's closure was announced mere weeks later.

Your aim is to survive for as long as possible as hordes of slime and bats close in around you, and it's an excellent time. So excellent, in fact, that it's already seen a few spin-offs.
And having sampled a couple of Vampire Survivor-likes, it's made me appreciative of the game's visual clarity. Yes, things can get messy, but at least you're able to make out what's happening on screen. I don't think it's something the subgenre has quite grasped yet.

        <updated>2022-11-23T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon "Emblems," characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.]]></summary>

While everybody, from developer to media to players, was expecting Sony Santa Monica's epic sequel God of War Ragnarok to light up the cash registers with the fury of Helios, perhaps nobody was quite expecting it to immediately become the fastest-selling launch in PlayStation's entire history, as decreed by the industry giant itself.
Over the course of its debut week, God of War Ragnarok shifted a staggering 5.1 million combined physical and digital copies, not only breaking launch records for the long-running mythological franchise, but also beating launch records for every single first-party game in PlayStation history, dating right back to the brand's debut in 1994. That's a meaty feat.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.  And it seems folks are into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had to check this particular Black Friday deal three times to make sure the specs were right, but yes, you can indeed get an RTX 3080-equipped version of the Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop for £1200. That’s hundreds upon hundreds of pounds less than the average RTX 3080 laptop, even during the current season of early Black Friday offers. 


Until Nvidia get around to making a mobile version of the RTX 4080, this is the second-most powerful RTX laptop GPU you can get, so it’s much more commonly found inside £2000-plus models. Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed. And it’s not like the other components are guff: the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is a perfectly adequate octa-core CPU, and the Nitro 5 ignores slow mechanical storage to equip itself with a 1TB SSD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 11 is coming on December 6
An an interesting move, Bethesda has revealed the theme for season 11 of Fallout 76: and it's going to fold over into the upcoming December 6 expansion. Yep, it's none other than Nuka-World, complete with a season map that depicts the theme park before the post-apocalyptic setting of the series.
Like past seasons (wow, has there really been 11 at this point?), Nuka-World will offer "cosmetics, CAMP items, atoms, caps, and more" as you progress through the track. There's a short trailer you can watch below that shows off the season offerings/rewards, as well as some of the expansion itself.
As a reminder, the ammo box is also coming, but only if you pay up for the game's subscription service: "Active Fallout 1st members can also unlock exclusive rewards and special S.C.O.R.E. boosts throughout the Season, but there’s more! This update also grants an all-new feature for Fallout 1st members at no additional charge: the Ammo Box! Keep unlimited numbers of your bullets, shells and such in safekeeping, like the existing Scrap Box currently available to Fallout 1st members. Note that the Ammo Box is for stackable ammo types only and won’t store Fusion Cores or Plasma Cores."
In addition to a few other "holiday games," I'm thinking I might hunker down and play through this expansion when things get slower in mid-December: the game is in a decent place to recruit friends into, especially with Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life's calling. My eyesight's terrible, for one, and I guarantee I'd be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don't think I'd even make it through the doors at NASA. They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.
There's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago I watched my Warzone Legacy, a two-minute-long compilation of my best stats from the first game, which included my K/D ratio and hours played and the like. It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.
My history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've got a friend in me (in a few weeks)
The next update to the mouse-powered isekai Disney Dreamlight Valley is arriving at the start of next month. The Toy Story realm joins Disney Dreamlight Valley on December 6, 2022.
The new update will arrive on all platforms on December 6, adding the new realm and Toy Story leads Woody and Buzz to the game. Plus, there are some Toy Story cosmetics in store for Disney Dreamlight Valley players to collect.
We got a good look at what's in store for the new area in a recent trailer. It highlights what's in store for intrepid Dreamlight Valley players who wander into Andy's Room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lStz8KPOHl8
Buzz Lightyear definitely looks like Buzz Lightyear, but Woody has some wild energy to him. The animations are really moving, in a way that makes me think this cowboy will definitely jump-scare at least one player on a stream.
That said, I've really enjoyed the way Disney Dreamlight Valley reimagines some popular Disney characters. Mickey's entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.
Venture into the valley
Disney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It's a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.
We'll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.

The tactics genre is an old one, and few stand out like Tactics Ogre. The original Let Us Cling Together has hit a number of devices, from the SNES to the PlayStaiton, on to the PSP and finally, with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, our current crop of modern consoles and PC.
Reborn is a remaster of a remake, bringing forward the PSP strategy classic to somewhere it’s more readily playable and fine-tuning it in the process. There are tons of videos and resources out there to grapple with all the changes, massive and miniscule, that Square Enix has made to this classic.

That changed with RimWorld 1.4, which adds "cross-expansion integration", so now you can use the ideology system from the Ideology expansion to, for example, tell stories about people who have ideologies about the biotech from the biotech expansion.

Nintendo has announced that will be adding golf to its sporting compendium Nintendo Switch Sports next week. The game enjoyed by rich capitalists and corrupt officials the world over will find itself added — free of charge — for all players on Monday, November 28.
The golf update will feature an adaptation of the much-enjoyed Wii Sports golf effort, complete with all of that title's 21 holes. Also included is a new "Survival Golf" tournament mode, which will support up to eight players online in a knockout competition to complete holes in the fewest strokes possible.
Of course, casual local play with pals will also be available, so you can probably get your relatives up off of the sofa this Holiday season. Spirit of '09 is back in action, baby.
Nintendo Switch Sports is available now on... Nintendo Switch, naturally.

The new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era's formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-'em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.

The Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.
Additionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title's official release. With the archiving of gaming's earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.
In related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cha cha real smooth
Ah, the "Cha Cha Slide." A simple, groovy party song that somehow wormed its way into every elementary school gym class in America. There's truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the "Cha Cha Slide" has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.
I had almost completely forgotten the "Cha Cha Slide" even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It's surprising how well the "Cha Cha Slide" translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.
https://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496
According to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the "Cha Cha Slide" in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here's hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.
As much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we're all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.

Nintendo Japan has released a new trailer for its upcoming fantasy epic Fire Emblem Engage, which launches on Nintendo Switch in January of the new year. The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as "Emblem Rings".
The Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.

As they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth. But maybe there will be more rings to be discovered, (or purchased), as the quest continues.
Fire Emblem Engage launches January 20, 2023 on Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, Fallout 76 is still around, and still pushing out major free updates. On December 6, the "Nuka-World on Tour" expansion is set to drop,
Bethesda and the powers that be are still pushing the "Fallout 1st" subscription, and it'll apparently offer a new feature called the "ammo storage box." Yep, it's exactly how it sounds, as the team is offering "unlimited space to store all your excess munitions [with the exception of Plasma Cores and Fusion Cores." It's fascinating to see premium elements that impact direct gameplay creep in over time, and how the community responds to it.
Whether you're thinking about jumping back in or you're excited for the update: there's some gameplay and developer commentary you can watch below. One of the best parts of the episode is actually near the start, where Carl McKevitt, senior quest designer, talks about how they carved out an existing area to make room for the actual "tour" in the Nuka-World on Tour location.
We don't really have a clear view of many things coming after this, so we'll see what 2023 brings. Next up, the team promises an update on December 1 with more info on Nuka-World on Tour.

Set in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. "Everything was a dive bar," Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. "It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was." His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard ("As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.
Back in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. "The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it," Popovich says.

Brothers, it's decent. Familiarity with the rock-paper-chainsword setup of Warhammer 40K arsenals is easing me into the unfamiliar world of retreating attacks and armour calculations. If you're in a similar position and also on Game Pass, maybe have a look before it leaves Microsoft's subscription service at the end of the month.

Coming to Steam on December 14th, Lil Gator Game involves most of the core components of childhood, such as displays of reckless acrobatics, pretending sticks are swords, and making friends with every other random child you meet. You can see what I mean by watching the trailer below.

There are fairly frequent frame drops and a few camera glitches, but nothing that’s ruined my experience just yet. What has caught my eye, though, is simply how small some of the Pokémon are in Paldea. They’re tiny little things, and the onslaught of oddly small critters reminds me that sometimes, size really does matter.

One thing I hadn’t thought of it as, at least until now, was a dance simulator, but then I’ve never used Tiktok. A cunning Warzone 2 player has managed to convince the enemy team to abandon their hostilities and indulge in a spot of shuffling to DJ Casper’s classic turn of the millennium hit Cha Cha Slide. It’s an odd choice, particularly considering they’re jumping around in a cemetery, but each to their own.

It's no secret that for a long while, my friends and I were smitten with its PS1-era graphics, snappy building, and heady mixture of relaxation and sense of dread. Our odyssey was one of carrots and boars, half-naked sails and bees.
So, count me excited when Liam and I had the chance to sample Valheim's next major update Mistlands, which brings with it a smoky new biome, magic, new building bits, and blimps that are actually giant ticks that soar in the sky and spit acidic warheads at you. It was great to be back.

This is, of all the ones I’ve tried, the best microSD card for Valve’s handheld PC, and it’s currently enjoying some discounts in both the UK and US.


These focus on the 256GB and 512GB models, the latter being the roomiest capacity that the Pro Plus comes in. Assuming that you do indeed find yourself constrained by your Deck’s own SSD, I’d suggest aiming for 512GB if you can – 256GB  will hold a fair few games but might also fill up fast if you’re installing a lot of gigabyte-hogging AAA games. Then again, an extra 256GB might be fine otherwise – many of the best Steam Deck games, like Vampire Survivors, have a tiny installation footprint. Your call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RPS supporters, who are very generous and probably smell fantastic, might recall a post last week in which I gushed about an Electriq eiQ-32M4K144FS that I’d bought secondhand. What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.


This is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ezio Auditore, the fire of Firenze, pulls the guard close in passionate embrace. It’s an intimacy born not of love but its close cousin, hate. Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.

Each new generation of Pokémon promises changes and iterations to the long-standing franchise formula. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet kick off the ninth generation of Pokémon games, offering some of the biggest changes to date. An open world, four-player co-op, and other additions effectively push the series forward in meaningful ways, but the technical shortcomings often break immersion and temper an otherwise strong Pokémon game.
The Pokémon formula remains mostly intact through Scarlet and Violet. Your main goals still involve catching, training,…]]></summary>

It’s a 12-player crazy golf game that dials up the crazy, and as we soon found back in those pre-vaccine days, one that reaches a whole other level of club-and-ball chaos with a single settings tweak.


See, with ball collision switched off, Golf With Your Friends is pretty fun. The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium.

This is one of the best early Black Friday PC deals we've spotted so far, and well worth picking up for games that benefit from controller input, like those in the racing, platformer, action and fighting genres. Of course, it's also an essential pickup if you like playing around with emulators, and of course works on two generations of Xbox consoles as well.

I haven't played either game, but Steve Hogarty described Sandrock as "Stardew Valley with a gun", so I probably should.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/11/18/sonic-designer-yuji-naka-arrested-for-alleged-insider-trading"/>
        <updated>2022-11-18T18:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it's an easy one. Sometimes it's agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you're rolling with. While you're at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you're kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. 


"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized," Wingefores said in the statement. "The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition."
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an "internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups," but says that "it is not necessarily the last." 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It's a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn't too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here's the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game's procedurally generated gore system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.]]></summary>

Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel's Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …]]></summary>

These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can't wait. However, there's still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we'll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it's Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…]]></summary>

Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon's ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we'll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. 
Unfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
