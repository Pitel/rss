        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Black Ops 6 beta on the horizon, Treyarch and Raven Software aim to increase the excitement even more with its Multiplayer Reveal trailer. 


The trailer jams in plenty of new and returning Call of Duty features, with one of the stand-outs being the body shield tactic. You may remember this Black Ops Cold War mechanic, allowing you to pick up a body and use it as a defense mechanism. Black Ops 6 offers this maneuver once again, which will go along nicely with its new Omnimovement.




Besides the body shields, we got a brief snippet of some shiny new toys to try. One, in particular, is a baseball bat melee weapon with a brutal Finishing Move. The RC-XD (Remote Controlled Explosive Device) also makes an appearance, bringing chaos along with it. Both tools were a part of past Call of Duty iterations, and now they'll be revamped in BO6.


The list of returning CoD features from this latest trailer could go on and on, including the classic tomahawks and Prestige system. Plus, the reveal confirms the comeback of the Prestige Master, a mechanic that permits players to reach Level 1,000. Although you won't be able to use it in the beta, it should be good to go by launch day.

In addition to this content, you can look forward to plenty of new features, especially with the 16 Black Ops 6 exclusive maps. The trailer already gave us a sneak peek into the brand-new locations, from the tropics to desolate buildings. It also teases the upcoming Operator skins that may tie into the Zombies Terminus crew.


You can experience this new world of Call of Duty once the Black Ops 6 beta and early access drops. But, if you want to make more preparations, get ready for the COD Next event on Aug. 28 for additional BO6 content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Behaviour Interactive announced that it would be publishing a Supermassive Games title set in the Dead by Daylight universe, I was skeptical about how it would work. This is a developer that makes incredible horror games, but I wasn't sure how the rich lore of this asymmetrical horror title could be translated in The Casting of Frank Stone. 


We recently had the opportunity to play the demo for Supermassive Games' upcoming title, and I'm happy to say that it nailed the brief on every mark. 


The Casting of Frank Stone is a story set in the Dead by Daylight universe and intrinsically linked to its lore. I don't want to spoil how, because you'll find out for yourself if you play the demo, but I want to clarify that this isn't a game that does its own thing in a beloved world with esta…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-08-26T15:28:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed Fatal Run 2089, a very late sequel to the very late 1990 game Fatal Run. More importantly, I don’t remember the last time I played a decent, new vehicular combat game. Maybe Gas Guzzlers Extreme or Carmageddon: Max Damage. Quite a drought in games about stapling miniguns to station wagons.


Fatal Run was a very latterday game for the Atari 2600 and 7800. As such, it was pretty much unknown to anyone outside the core fanbase of those consoles until its inclusion in the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. That’s when I played it, and while the 2600 version just feels significant for the way it translated the game to well-fermented hardware, the 7800 version was fun. Of course, as a fan of raster racing games and car combat, I was set.




Fatal Run 2089 looks pretty fun. It’s running on Unreal Engine 5, but I wouldn’t have guessed that. It has the grungy metal look and simple terrain of an Unreal Engine 3 title. However, it does have it where it counts, by which I mean when you land a jump, the camera shakes to make it seem like your car is very heavy. Like in Burnout 3 or Split/Second.


There are corkscrews, 20 tracks, and I spy boss vehicles. The press release promises “branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces that keep every run intense and unpredictable.” There are seven vehicles, four bosses, and you can upgrade your vehicle by picking up (in-game) currency.


Fatal Run 2089 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch (?) and PC sometime in 2025.

Not only do these streams normally not focus on Nintendo news (Partners and Indies are both third-party showcases), but Nintendo is outright saying that there will be no mention of the Switch successor.




What can we expect then? Well, the Silksong faithful are already donning their clown masks. And I mean, we have to hear something about that game again at some point, right? Oh no. It's happening to me too.


I expect the Indie World side of things to be full of surprises and, fingers crossed, a "later today" drop or two. Those are always exciting to see, and my Switch could use a new indie game or two to pick away at.


As for the Partner Showcase, that will be all third-party offerings. My best speculation is to expect some frequent collaborators; Square Enix, for example, or Marvelous. I'd love to get some more details on whatever Level-5 has been up to as well. After the delay of Fantasy Life i into 2025, I'm curious about where that's left their other games, like Decapolice.


We'll find out what's in store for the Switch as we head into the Nintendo Direct double-header tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT.

The studio, itself, is relatively new, as a Belgium independent-led company in Brussels. Koira marks its first-ever game release with Life Is Strange and Jusant publisher Don't Nod. I got the chance to play the entry's demo for a brief sneak peek. Although it lasted less than an hour, it was the most calming part of my day, with the melodic tunes of its peaceful soundtrack and the heartwarming moments shared with its dog companion.

Retro Games Ltd has been creating mini consoles based on microcomputers for a while now and has released The C64 Mini (Commodore 64), The A500 Mini (Commodore Amiga), and The 400 Mini (Atari 400). This time around, they’re resurrecting Sinclair’s ZX Spectrum, which is, in my opinion, one of the coolest 8-bit home computers. It’s the distinctive color palette that makes it for me.


The ZX Spectrum was released in 1982, well past the 1977 microcomputer trinity (Commodore PET, Apple II, and TRS-80) that helped bring computers into the home. The rush was on to get a cheap …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley has over 1,000 clothing types you can obtain between the base game and its expansions, giving you limitless ways to design your day-to-day fashion. What better way to appreciate your favorite outfits than to save them as a preset and return to them whenever you'd like?


Where to find and save outfit presets in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Here are the exact steps you can use to save outfit presets in Disney Dreamlight Valley:



Open your inventory.


Select Wardrobe.


Open the Favorites category.


Pick Add New and choose a name for your outfit preset.



Screenshot by Destructoid


You can save up to four presets at a time, giving you several, albeit not unlimited, outfit options. From here, you can select any preset to equip it, giving you a quick and easy way to wear those clothes again if you have to swap them out for any reason.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Alongside equipping your presets, you can also overwrite them to replace the outfit with what you're wearing now, rename it to make it easier to distinguish from others, or delete it to make room for another set. Since there's a four preset limit, you can't have hundreds of clothing options to swap through, but you can have a few of your favorites that you can tweak through the regular wardrobe categories.


Having presets is especially helpful if you're completing quests or completing Daisy's Boutique challenges and don't want to risk losing your current outfit. That way, you can wear the mission's clothes or accessories and return to your previous outfit later without searching through each category for items.

Developed by MNSTR Studio, Fatal Run 2089's debut trailer showcases an apoccalyptic wasteland in which several Mad Max-inspired vehicles race across deadly tracks filled with lasers and explosions, all the while fighting off enemy vehicles and even ferocious boss characters.

In some ways, the classic landmark staples of a Ubisoft game are very much present: the massive open world (well worlds, in Outlaws), a gazillion side quests, and lots of loot and collectibles tucked in every corner. But in other ways, Outlaws tries some new things to stand out from being "another big open world Ubisoft game", and while it doesn't succeed at all of them, it does at most of them, creating what has been a mostly enjoyable experience thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you explore the regions of The War Within and meet the allies whose Renown grinds you'll be (thankfully) sharing across all your alts, you'll also be discovering new obtuse currencies such as the Earth-Encrusted Gem. This thing is a low-fantasy transmog farmer's dream, but as far as where to spend it, you'll be running around like a Kobold without a candle if you don't know where to look.


Where to find Osidion in Dornogal


You'll need to find the ensemble vendor Osidion within the Forgegrounds in Dornogal, located at the location shown on the map below:


Screenshot by Destructoid.


So, just in case you made your way here without knowing: how do you get Earth-Encrusted Gems? Renown, of course! You'll get one Earth-Encrusted gem at the following Renown levels:



Council of Dornogal: Level 4 and Level 20


Assembly of the Deep: Level 4, 15, and 20


Hallowfall Arathi: Level 5 and Level 20


The Severed Threads: Level 9 and Level 20



That's nine total complete ensemble sets from Osidion throughout your journey, and some of them are pretty choice. From full wizard-themed sets to low-fantasy mining dwarf attire, these threads are a nice counter to the flashier sets you'll get via gearing. 


It should be noted that Earth-Encrusted gems are Warband rewards, which means you'll only be getting one across your characters at each of the reward levels above. That said, nine is a pretty comfy number, so unless you're a real Trial-of-Style-head, you should have your fill and then some by the end of the expansion.

One might attribute these numbers to the release of Black Myth: Wukong, currently the most-played game on Steam. Wukong is already one of the platform's biggest-ever hits, but it is only responsible for two million concurrent players, a comparatively low figure if you're looking at the big number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a lateral pass in Madden 25 might not be your go-to option in offense at all times, but it can certainly help you to get out of a tricky situation.


Usually, most plays in the offense either involve making a run with your RB or throwing it to one of your receivers. There will be times when you may have to shift from your preplanned course of action just to ensure that your play doesn't get interrupted by the defense. But if you're someone who likes to take a risk and make some trick plays, the lateral might just be an excellent addition to your arsenal of offensive plays.


How to perform a lateral pass in Madden 25


A standard pass, whether it's a lob or bullet, travels forward. The lateral has a backwards or sideways trajectory. Typically, it passes the ball from the QB to one of your RBs, who then tries to dart forward and gain yards.

To hit a lateral switch, press the LB/L1 button, and your ball carrier will pass it off to the closest receiver. This type of pass is straightforward to make, but there are certain aspects to keep in mind before you attempt. Just like a forward pass, a lateral can be intercepted by the defense if they're close enough.


Unlike a forward pass, an unsuccessful lateral switch doesn't lead to a stop in play if the ball hits the ground. This increases the odds of a fumble (which doesn't happen if your forward pass hits the ground). Also, you can make multiple lateral switches, but it's best to avoid doing that.


So far, the lateral switch is a good option after receiving kickoffs and punts. But in those cases, you'll need to run really close to another player on your team before trying to attempt the pass. When I manage to do it successfully, it certainly adds at least a few more yards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Jujutsu Kaisen were shocked a few days back by the sudden announcement of the manga's imminent end. A new announcement gives fans something to look forward to in the coming year. The anime's official X (formerly Twitter) account reveals that a compilation film for Season 2 will be released in Japan in 2025.


The social media account also included a teaser visual alongside the news.




This film will condense the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death arc. The arc delves into the backstory of two of the series' most important characters, Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto, during their time as students of Jujutsu High. It also delves into how the two close friends ended up pursuing different paths — one towards becoming the world’s strongest sorcerer and the other towards a tragic downfall.


In addition to the film, more Jujutsu Kaisen content is on the horizon. During the recent JujuFes 2024 event, it was revealed that an official guidebook covering both the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death and Shibuya Incident arcs will be released on October 4, 2024. According to AnimeTV, this guidebook will offer fans a deeper look into the series with detailed setting materials and exclusive commentary from the cast and staff.


For those looking to catch up or relive the series, both seasons of Jujutsu Kaisen, along with the prequel film Jujutsu Kaisen 0, are available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix in select regions. Furthermore, a third season of the anime adapting the Culling Game arc is currently in production under MAPPA.

        <updated>2024-08-25T14:51:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official ratings reveal of EA FC 25 is yet to take place, but if you're someone who believes in social media rumors, Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo will have an 86-rated base item inside the game. 


This rumor appears from reliable leaker and content specialist AsyFutTrader, who posted the information on their X account. Ronaldo is the latest in a series of popular footballers whose cards have reportedly been leaked.


 I still have doubts about the actual in-game stats, and these have not been officially released yet, so I'd advise reserving judgment until the developers fully reveal them. 


Cristiano Ronaldo's rumored item in EA FC 25 looks similar to EA FC 24


Footballers with similar ratings between EA FC 24 and EA FC 25 will be very common. After all, there are very few names who undergo a drastic overhaul within a year. In Cristiano Ronaldo's case, it's rumored that he will retain his overall of 86. This also means that the Portuguese forward will be a walkout in Ultimate Team once again.


His key card stats are rumored to undergo some changes. His passing and physicality numbers have improved, but the rest are the same as his card in. Of course, it's best to wait for the full in-game stats reveal from EA Sports before we can judge how effective he could be in the game.


Personally, I am expecting Ronaldo to get a slight nerf in his ratings. He has been consistent for his club side, but his performances for the country have been lackluster. He has also aged by a year, and footballers do slow down as they age.


If this rumored card turns out to be his actual in-game item one month from now, it will still be usable. For now, I am patiently waiting for the official ratings reveal from EA Sports, which is expected later this month.

Some of the most intriguing and impactful fights have been mentioned in passing or shown incompletely, making us fans wonder what actually happened during those moments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rise of Luffy from a pirate wannabe to a God of One Piece has been remarkable. He is one of the few characters who managed to skyrocket in infamy during his career as a pirate. He has not only got himself recognized as part of the Worst Generation, but he has also been properly recognized as an Emperor of the Sea. One thing big-name pirates have going for them is their remarkable military force. For instance, Big Mom literally has islands of warriors ready to mobilize at her command.


With Luffy's rise in infamy, it's only natural that he himself has a fleet sailing under his name. This came into realization during the Dressrosa Arc, wherein a few of his Colosseum co-competitors underwent a sakazuki pledge to serve him. Despite Luffy's initial reluctance, the Grand Fleet still came in…]]></summary>

The concept of Galaxy Burger is simple: travel the universe opening a string of burger joints to serve aliens (and mecha-cats) their much needed junk food. As a concept, it’s pretty simple and actually oddly relaxing, but one of the features in the full game which wasn’t in the demo is Multiplayer. I truly was not ready for the chaos this presents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The longest journey for a slice of strawberry pie.
Would you battle fearsome monsters for a homemade strawberry pie? If so, you’re in good company. WitchSpring R is a whimsical, story-driven RPG that follows the story of Pieberry, a talented young witch who’s grown up in the woods by herself.
As the name might suggest, Pieberry is a big fan of pies. And strawberries. The story starts off calmly enough, with Pieberry attempting to leave her magical forest home to track down a strawberry pie like the one she ate as a child, all while trying to understand why she was seemingly abandoned by her parents. It spirals from there, with a vast world and vibrant roster of characters, ranging from pudding monsters and lightning lions to witch hunters and celestial beings. It’s a narrative-driven experience, but the gameplay switches from turn-based combat to fun puzzles quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything I know about the French Revolution has hitherto come from two literary works: Hilary Mantel's excellent doorstopper A Place Of Greater Safety, and Kate Beaton's webcomics. Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Age of Empires with dinosaurs" is, the developers of the Dinolords recently told me in a cramped Gamescom booth, a flattering description for their upcoming England vs. Vikingsaurus RTS. It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

Well, it sounds like MySims could be making a comeback. Spotted by ResetEra user --R (via GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit), listings for a Switch version of the game have appeared on European retailers Virtex and World of Games along with a 19th November 2024 release date.

Nintendo is ramping up the marketing for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ahead of its 26th September launch. The latest teaser serves as a whistle-stop tour of the Faron Wetlands region, giving us a closer look at the new location.
You might remember this region making an appearance in Nintendo's earlier 'Traversing Hyrule' trailer, where we learnt that the area was home to some hungry Deku Scrubs — though that was about all we saw. Today's look (shared to Twitter by @NintendoUK) doesn't contain any new information, per se, but it does give a closer look at the environment and some new footage of the beasties we can expect to find there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) has carried out a successful raid against a pirate IPTV provider that had been capturing broadcasters' content for at least two years. Authorities say the operation was hidden in a house with an outward appearance of being abandoned years ago. Among 279 items seized were 72 set-top boxes, 72 video encoders, servers, networking hardware, bank books, and mobile phones.  Two suspects were arrested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

Earlier this year the company's P.Cok anti-piracy unit offered rewards for webtoon fans to snitch on pirates. With the release of Kakao's fifth anti-piracy report, the company details its successes and reveals legal action targeting three major manga sites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Oh, I missed this. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December 2022, music industry giants including BMG, UMG, and Capitol, filed a massive copyright infringement lawsuit against Altice, owners of internet service provider Optimum. The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The one that, by the admission of developers Game Science themselves, "may not fully represent the actual gaming experience and final performance at the time of the game's release". Monkey nuts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any gags I could make about an update that lets Total War: Warhammer 3’s dawi play tall are far too obvious for the discerning comedic palette that brought you such bangers as that time I just wrote “(penis)” a bunch so the Overkill’s Walking Dead page wouldn’t quote me out of context, so let’s just dive right in to the details. The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cox Communications has filed a petition at the Supreme Court, requesting a review of a Fourth Circuit ruling that held the company liable for pirating subscribers. While the case is ultimately about service provider liability, the ISP stresses that the current verdict jeopardizes internet access for all Americans, and threatens to cause mass disruption across the internet.

This cosy game has received a lot of attention, becoming the fourth most-played demo during Steam Next Fest and earning a place within our own list of favourite demos. It now has a release date - 23rd September 2024.

You remember that thing, right? Plus, no-one’s got a big enough table. Or the new errata. Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode. James, Edwin and Nic were initially all booked-up for the week, but Horace repeated himself, making it absolutely clear that it wasn’t a question.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets?

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.
