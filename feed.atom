This rules because it's both the return of the series' most iconic villain, but also because this particular update might change the way the story of Tekken progresses going forward.




What's so special about Heihachi in Tekken 8?


Tekken 8, like most modern fighting games, is no stranger to DLC characters. It had previously added Eddy Gordo, the fan-favorite capoeira fighter introduced way back in Tekken 3, and is about to introduce Tekken 7's Lidia, the — I kid you not — Karate-fighting Prime Minister of Poland.


Heihachi, however, will be the first DLC character in Tekken history to feature a return powerful enough to push the plot forward. That's right, even…]]></summary>

Minecraft MCC Party 2024 Lost Pearl location


Players can find Minecraft's Lost Pearl toward the end of the Grid Runners mini-game. It will be accessible after the third stage, where you should see a few pools of water. Before reaching the finishing line, look to the left to grab the Lost Pearl (inside a bubble). You must also have the Aqua Axolotl Beanie equipped since you won't be able to pick it up without it.

Nilou Character Ascension Requirements


Perpetual Caliber - Aeonblight Drake


Nilou’s world boss is the Aeonblight Drake located in the Ardravi Valley in Sumeru. The Aeonblight Drake will take to the air midway through the fight. You can force it to the ground and stun it by shooting the glowing points on its wings and chest.


Nilou will need 46 boss drops in order to reach level 90. This means that at World Level 8, you should expect to challenge the Aeonblight Drake around 18 times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then, something might go wrong in Roblox. For example, server outages can cause certain aspects of the game to not function properly. Other times, Roblox might even be tagging everything you say, so why is that?


Why is Roblox tagging everything I’m saying? 


If you’re wondering why Roblox is tagging everything you say into the chat, it can be for three reasons:


Server issues


In July of 2024, there was a “partial server disruption” that caused everything said in the game’s chat to be filtered. This means that whatever you type into the game will appear as tags. For example, if you say hello to someone, all you’d see is “#####”.


Many players would see this and think that maybe they’re being hacked or their accounts are being monitored for bad activity. Rest assured, that isn’t the case. 


Always check the game’s server status to see if there are any problems regarding server hiccups should these persist.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Chat restrictions


If the servers are all good and everything is fine, but you’re still getting this, it might actually be a you thing. If you are typing expletives, offensive or harassing words, or other sensitive material into chat, your messages are going to be filtered out. 


Try sending a normal message like hello or something normal to see if you’re still being restricted in chat. Otherwise, it might be an age restriction thing.


Age restrictions


If you have an account and your age is set to 13 or younger, most chat will be filtered out with tags. This is just to prevent most if not all, potentially inappropriate things and sensitive info from being sent out or seen. 


If your account is above the age of 13, more things can be sent and seen, though there will still be some restrictions.

Koriko fits very naturally into the genre of cozy solo TTRPGs, telling the story of a teenage witch leaving home for the first time to live in the exciting city of Koriko.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitLife has many careers you can pursue, ranging from entry-level jobs right out of high school to advanced, high-paying positions requiring years of schooling. While you could go through four years of university and extra if you pursue graduate programs, the Golden Diploma gives you an easy way to obtain a degree instantly.


Where to get the Golden Diploma in BitLife


BitLife's Golden Diploma is a premium item in the game's marketplace. Its full price is $13.99, with the price dropping during sales. You can access the store by heading into the main menu, selecting BitLife Marketplace, and scrolling down to items until you find the Golden Diploma. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Much like the Golden Pacifier, the Golden Diploma isn't available as a free item you can unlock through achievements or challenges. If you want to experience it yourself, the marketplace is the only legitimate place to get it.


What does the Golden Diploma do in BitLife?


After purchasing the Golden Diploma, you can use it to get a degree for any character who's graduated from secondary school. Once they graduate, head into the Occupation menu to find Golden Diploma at the top, allowing you to view the complete degree list. You can choose up to two degrees, including those from Law and Medical school.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Since you obtain the degree instantly after selecting it, you won't have to wait four to eight years to complete your course. In other words, you can enter the medical field and get a high-paying job as a family physician, psychologist, or brain surgeon immediately after finishing high school, compared to waiting nearly ten years. You'll also skip paying for tuition, regardless of whether your character is eligible for a scholarship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Etherlight and Oatmello have their game Dreamsweeper releasing in two days on July 24, 2024. It’s a strange mix of dungeon crawler roguelite and the classic game of murky origins, Minesweeper.


It’s not often that you see Minesweeper bleed into other games. The classic of early Windows computers had you searching a field of blocks while trying to – counter to its name – avoid mines. Your only way of locating the mines is by numerical hints that appear beside cleared blocks that let you know how many mines border on a given square.




I used to be really good at it back when I was younger. I feel a lot of people old enough had a phase where they had it mastered.


Dreamsweeper lifts the mine-avoidant gameplay and applies it to a dungeon crawler. Each step you take brings with it risks, and a cleared block will show the number of bordering threats. Tussles with enemies is depicted as a rhythm game. You can purchase accessories that will alter the way the game plays.


Speaking of rhythm, Dreamsweeper sports a lo-fi soundtrack, which is supposed to relax you while you advance through procedurally generated dungeons with nothing but arithmetic to help you avoid disaster.


Dreamsweeper releases on PC July 24, 2022. A Switch version is planned for sometime later.

10. Gambler's Blade (Lost Laboratory of Kwalish)


Gamblers like to push their luck, and none more so than the adventurer wielding the Gambler's Blade. This sword gives a bonus between +1 and +3 to attack and damage rolls, which can be changed every dawn, but it also applies the same bonus to the wielder's death saving throws. On top of that, it has a curse on it that means a character won't want to part with it. The idea of throwing in an item that just sits there, quietly tempting a player without the GM having to say a word, is particularly delightful.

        <updated>2024-07-22T19:27:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Orebody Inc., the makers of, er, Orebody, has announced that Crater Song, which features singleplayer co-op, has a physical cartridge version on the way. That is to say, you have two characters that you, as a singular player, control at the same time. Like if Adventures of Lolo had you playing as both Lolo and Lala at once.


Inspired by games like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Crater Song is built with the NES in mind, with a physical cartridge version in the works. If you’re on digital (say NES) controllers, you turn them sideways, using a d-pad for each character. If you don’t mind that I keep coming at you with obscure references, it’s like how the NES version of Smash T.V. handled its dual-stick gameplay.




While much of its gameplay shows off avoiding enemies to step on buttons (and sing, apparently), there are also sections of third-person quasi-3D travel that are similar to 3D Worldrunner.


Crater Song is set on the same world as Orebody: Binder’s Tale. You play as the twins, Arco and Menuett, who are cursed to attract cosmic horrors, which reminds me of my dating life. It came out in March of this year, but, as part of the physical announcement, they have released a “Definitive Edition” update.


It seems neat. I actually own the NES cartridge version of Orebody: Binder’s Tale, and for some reason, I still haven’t played it. Mostly, I just love the era we’re living in when it comes to homebrew games. Even legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage, Beyond Oasis), is working on a new game for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Old hardware rules. Modernity sucks. Yes, I’m old.


Crater Song is out on itch.io. The physical version will be through Premium Edition Games with preorders going up sometime in the near future.

Kunitsu-Gami is the kind of wonderful, left-field Capcom release we don’t see often these days. Bound to be a cult classic in the future, Path of the Goddess is original and does not lean on any of Capcom’s established properties. Instead, it relies on an admittedly difficult-to-explain but well-executed gameplay loop that I found hard to put down with an art style that is equally challenging to look away from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hype for Baldur’s Gate 3’s seventh major patch continues to rise, especially with highlights revealing the introduction of new endings, official modding support, and over 1,000 bug fixes across multiple core areas. However, while Larian Studios initially planned to release this patch's Closed Beta on July 22, they've since announced a delay caused by passive dice roll bugs.


In Larian Studios’ latest announcement regarding BG3’s Patch 7 Closed Beta testing, the team revealed that a bug causing passive dice rolls to stop working led to a brief delay in the beta’s release. While no exact revised date was revealed in the announcement, it mentions it’ll launch “later this week”, suggesting that this is a brief delay as they quickly resolve the issue.


Fortunately, this delay doesn’t seem to impact Patch 7’s release date, as the announcement still mentions September as the public launch time.


Larian Studios first mentioned Baldur’s Gate 3’s seventh patch in an April Community Update, where they detailed some of the bug fixes we can expect from this major update. Since then, each one, particularly the latest Community Update 28 Closed Beta announcement, continued revealing more details about it, with features like split screen mode, evil endings, and the official modding toolkit among the massive list of upcoming improvements.


As of now, Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 7 Closed Beta will still be available sometime between July 23 and 27, with no exact time or date currently known. You can sign up for the beta by visiting the game's Steam store page and requesting access to its playtest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus has two new fighters on the way in the form of Jack from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim's beloved animated series Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice of, well, Beetlejuice and its upcoming sequel (don’t make me write it a third time). The game is also getting a ranked mode.
Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. 


Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.
MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as The Joker, The Matrix's Agent Smith, and Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The curtains are beginning to close on World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, with The War Within's pre-expansion patch segueing into the next multi-expansion storyline tomorrow, July 23. If you're still actively playing, you're probably familiar with Awakened Raids and their special currency, Bronze Bullions. If you've been hoarding these, I have the perfect place for you to blow some dosh and get some sweet cosmetics.


How to get Bullions (even if you haven't played in a while)


Bronze Bullions started dropping a while ago as a part of the "grand finale" of Dragonflight. One raid per week became "Awakened," offering higher-tier loot and one Bullion per week. If you missed weeks, don't fret - all missed Bullions are added to your drop pool. You can easily get a whole heaping of Bullions just by killing some Awakened 'Looking For Raid' bosses. Doing so will give a chance for a Bullion (it's pretty high, probably 30-40% in my experience) until every possible catch-up drop is exhausted. 


See Mirioszin in the Parting Glass for Jigglesworth Sr. and transmog


Once you've got a few Bullions, head over to the Parting Glass and see Mirioszin, who's cheekily hidden away behind all the gear vendors:

Since it's the end of the expansion, you certainly don't need to be spending a bunch of Bullions on gear, so why don't we get something that will carry over to War Within? Cosmetics! You can get the Jigglesworth Sr. mount for 3 Bullions, or any Dragonflight raid weapon appearance for just one. Happy spending!

Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Skeleton Crew Studio have revealed Forestrike, a kung-fu roguelike all about solving puzzles and landing punches.
Set to launch on Switch next year, Forestrike will put you in the shoes of Yu, a martial artist on a mission across the country to save his Emperor. As you might imagine, there will be a fair amount of fighting along the way, but this isn't your usual action-focused roguelike as you'll be relying on Yu's 'Foresight' ability to play out combat encounters ahead of time and learn how to escape them unscathed.

Aurora is a rather unique case among the roster in that she's a character that provides more utility than anything damage-related.

The Dragon Age games have always been dialogue-heavy, with big close-ups of fidgety foot-locked characters. A weak cast member with a bad performance can stick out like a sore thumb, but it looks like the company has pulled out the big guns for this one. I shudder to imagine what the voice budget looks like.


Here’s the full rundown straight from EA’s news blog:



Ali Hillis (Mass Effect 3, Naruto), returns to the fray as Harding, the dwarven scout, a Dragon Age: Inquisition hero with a big heart, a positive outlook, and a ready bow – as well as unexpected magical powers.

Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition has been out on Switch for a few days now, bringing with it plenty of fast-paced retro delights and highlights.
Inspired by the Nintendo World Championships and acting as a sort of spiritual follow-up to the NES Remix games, it was a bit of a surprise announcement back in May. Yep, Nintendo pulled another one of those — game announcement in May, release it in July... slow down.

But to awaken her full potential, you will first need to collect a pretty hefty amount of Pavo Plum berries. To help do that as fast as possible, here's where to find all of the Pavo Plum berries in Wuthering Waves, as well as where to buy the resource. 


All Pavo Plum locations in Wuthering Waves


You can find a total of 60 Pavo Plums in Wuthering Waves, all of which will be located on Mt. Firmament's Luminous Shore sub-region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re just diving into Dawntrail’s Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries in Final Fantasy XIV, you’re going to need a lot of ingredients to get those requested items crafted. While most of these are easy to source, some may leave you wondering. 


One of the five different quest lines featured as part of Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries is through Xeerol Ja, who requests your help to expand the menu of their juice business. This is the quest line which can be completed using either Culinarian or Alchemist, so it’s definitely a good one to do if you’re working your way towards grinding out Orange Crafters’ Scrips. 


The second recipe you’ll be asked to make in this quest line in Cherimoya Juice. One of the ingredients, as you’ve likely surmised, is Cherimoya, but it’s not immediately clear how to get it.

Cherimoya doesn’t appear in the Gathering Log, regardless of the levels of your Gathering classes, because it cannot be gathered. It also cannot be crafted. In that case, your first instinct is likely to be to head to the Marketboard, but as with any ‘rare’ item, the prices there are less than favorable. 


Don’t part with your Gil too quickly - getting Cherimoya is actually remarkably easy, because it’s sold by a specific vendor in Tuliyollal. It’s not too expensive, and you can buy as many as you like without having to meet any requirements.

Goplu, located in Bayside Bevy Marketplace at (X:13.1, Y:12.7), sells a variety of items including Grade 8 Dark Matter, Gysahl Greens, and Fishing bait, but they're also the only vendor in FFXIV who sells Cherimoya.


At 986 Gil each, Cherimoya isn’t the cheapest of ingredients, but you only need six of them in order to complete the recipes for Xeerol Ja. On my server, this price is almost doubled by those who sell them on the Marketboard.

This episode isn’t without its duds. Getting the weakest section out of the way, Frenchie and Kimiko finally get together, but after a season-long will-they-won’t-they that felt distracted at best. So much of their progress was spent obsessing over Frenchie’s Colin-focused melodrama instead, boiling down to a discussion about self worth that was so overdue it felt too on the nose at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go frequently hosts limited-time events, typically only lasting a day or even one hour. That's why it's crucial to keep track of the game's event schedules, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here's the current Pokémon Go Community Day schedule for July 2024.


When is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?


According to the official Pokémon Go page, the next Community Day will be Aug. 31. The featured Pokémon for this event has yet to be revealed. However, some theories have speculated a Popplio-centered launch. Since the other two Sun and Moon starters, Litten and Rowlet, have previously celebrated a Community Day in 2024, it would make sense for Popplio to be the next one up. 


No matter what Pokémon gets the spotlight, you can always expect a Shiny variant for this creature. They'll also spawn more frequently in the wilds to give you better chances. 


Besides the wild counters, trainers can unlock a special attack for the featured Pokémon. We've seen this with Tynamo's latest Community Day, providing a Fast Attack Volt Switch for its evolution.

A Special Research Story will likely be available before the event. This story unlocks an exclusive mission for the Community Day Pokémon but at the cost of one dollar. Additionally, event bonuses can be earned during the event, including a reduced Stardust cost for trades, Lure Modules extension, and double candy rewards. 


It should be noted that Community Days are often limited in time. Generally, these celebrations last for three hours, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. They also tend to debut on Saturdays or Sundays, so make sure to clear your schedule for the weekend.

The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.


SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.]]></summary>

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.

@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS
July 22, 2024
For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.
It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.
The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. 
A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. 


Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.

Beyond that, there is little else to report, but one user responded to the statement by expressing fans' appreciation for the ongoing updates, noting that they likely won't be bothered by the lengthy wait so long as the content remains free.

We have mused on the idea of a 'Paper Zelda' game before, but 'Paper Pokémon'? That's not something we ever thought we needed. Until today, that is.
Animator and artist Spyrook has created a Pokémon-meets-Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door mash-up and it looks incredible. In the above video, you can witness a duo battle between Riolu / Ralts and Mawile / "Eevee" (though there's something shifty going on with the latter), lovingly recreated in Paper Mario's theatre setting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slide it over.
There isn’t another puzzle game like Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It makes sense that a game about celebrating the differences between humans and the world would be so different. With Arranger, Furniture & Mattress – the studio formed by the lead writer on Carto, the artist of Braid, and the puzzle designer on ETHEREAL – wants to give every single person, no matter their differences, a warm embrace. Different is beautiful, and Arranger is here to tell us that in the most chipper, heartwarming way.
You might have guessed it already, but Arranger is more than just a puzzle game. As the title suggests, it borrows a lot from the role-playing genre, mostly in terms of its story. There are boss fights, dungeons, usable weapons, and gadgets – really, while it could be an RPG, it’s just as akin to a Legend of Zelda title, albeit with a coming-of-age slant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arranger is a puzzle game about moving, in both metaphorical and literal senses. Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

Re-Ment took to Twitter to reveal the new collection, which this time is modelled on the world of Pikmin 4. There are six different figures available in the upcoming blind box range, each displaying a Pikmin scenario playing out in a 'glass' (or, more accurately, plastic) bottle.

Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

However, after studying political events in Bulgaria and the United States, it was possible to provide plausible information on potential contributing factors. Similar questions are now being asked about Fmovies. Did it die from a single blow or collapse under the cumulative effects of many?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged).

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Successful rebuilds require strong foundations. After a drought, Alabama’s Nick Saban reinforced his staff with innovative coordinators like Kirby Smart and Lane Kiffin. Urban Meyer urged beloved Gators captain Tim Tebow to inspire his teammates. And during his short tenure at Texas A&M, Jimbo Fisher secured extraordinary recruiting classes. The road to success is paved in various ways, but EA Orlando knows football doesn’t have to be rocket science. In EA Sports College Football 25 (CFB 25), coaching chemistry is an engaging skil…]]></summary>

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest.

It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

        <updated>2024-07-19T01:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game's first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game.

Tomorrow, I promise, it'll be wall-to-wall wholesome life sims, pastel petals and hug emojis as far as the eye can see. But before then, a quick piece on well-received DreadXP-published horror sim The Mortuary Assistant, which will shortly be updated with an "endless embalming-only mode" that strips out the game's supernatural scares and turns it into a very downbeat job sim.

And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>

Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout, a TV adaptation of the popular post-apocalyptic video game series, was released on Amazon Prime this past April. Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
Fallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…]]></summary>

Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.

NES games are difficult to revisit. They’re easy to find and play, but they are showing their age and have been for some time. To play the original Legend of Zelda, for example, rewards a difficult-to-control, often obtuse puzzle game whose importance to the industry is undeniable, but its contemporary fun factor is low. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition counters this with a strategy that WarioWare has been using to great effect since its inception: you only play classic Nintendo games for exactly as long as they’re fun – which in 2024 is anywhere from three secon…]]></summary>

Since then, this slimline gaming laptop has elbowed its way into more regular use within the Archer household, particularly when I have portable PC needs that the Steam Deck can’t quite satisfy. Now you too can get one on the cheap, by way of a chunky Prime Day discount – and as if God himself was calling me a loser nerd, it’s the significantly brawnier RTX 4060 model to boot.

In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox 360 digital store shuts down later this month on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.
For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. 
Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:
Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.
Navigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.
Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds
Select the background art you want using the A button.

        <updated>2024-07-16T17:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. 
Tomb Raider Chapter
Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:
Finesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.
Hardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.
Specialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.


2v8 Mode
On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. 


Cross-Progression
Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. 
Today’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. 
Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.


We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. 
The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major Baldur's Gate 3 patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.

Here, though, you can nab the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Windforce OC edition at a 15% discount, bringing it down to a far more agreeable £238. Nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies for the two handheld-minded deals posts in a row, readers, but I’ve just noticed that the Prime Day 2024 has made the Lenovo Legion Go – a bulky but commendably unique handheld Windows PC – cheaper than it’s ever been in the UK. Provided you’ve got an Amazon Prime account, or at least the free Prime trial, the 512GB model can be yours for £569, a saving of £131. Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day is once again bearing the PC hardware fruits, with big discounts on one of the absolute best microSD cards for the Steam Deck (and other handhelds). Specifically, it’s the SanDisk Ultra, and not the diddly 64GB model in the picture above but the honking great 1.5TB version. It's dropped below the £100 / $100 mark for the first time and, while Amazon has the lowest overall prices, it’s on sale elsewhere, allowing you to dodge the usual Prime subscription requirement.

It's a gentle exploration game from the people who brought you Wimot's Warehouse and I Am Dead (including Pip Warr, RPS in peace) where you never touch the ground, instead gliding around the strange forests and rippling meadows atop a giant bird with a beautiful trailing tail. Big Journey vibes, but more whimsical and colourful.

And with Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let's dolphin dive in, shall we.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".

It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. 
With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. 
A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.]]></summary>

It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. 
While waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Game Hotel came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.


For a while lot more on Concord, which releases on PlayStation 5 and PC August on August 23, head here to read about how it plays like Destiny meets Overwatch.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo added three new games to its Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library, and though none of the them are Mother 3 (or a Pokémon game or Astro Boy or Drill Dozer or any other GBA game we've been clamoring for) they are none-the-less interesting and completely unexpected.
Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game's developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details - or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than those of the many other developers who collect your personal information.

Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!

However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel.

Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once.

Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet Coaster 2 arrives later this year and its big update, alongside all the rollercoaster and theme park simulation gameplay of the first title, is the inclusion of water park mechanics. You will be able to create water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and more. You will also be able to visit your friend's parks and build together in a shared sandbox mode (though you will apparently have to build one at a time) across platforms. You can check out the announcement trailer below.


Frontier is promising its first look at gameplay on July 31, and Planet Coaster 2 will arrive later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To read Game Informer's Planet Coaster review, follow the link.]]></summary>

A new, obviously gorgeous adventure with serious platforming pedigree and that’s your response? Grow up, me.

Not for me it isn't, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as "meandering lazy rivers", "adrenaline-pumping wave pools", "looping flumes" and "exhilarating water coasters". Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent's Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.

        <updated>2024-07-11T14:04:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

They’re also doing away with Xbox Game Pass For Console, while introducing a new Standard tier for console users which includes the Xbox back catalogue but doesn’t offer day-one access to new games.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already know that you’ll be able to romance all your companions in the upcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Sounds a bit synthetic on the surface, right? Even fantastic games like Baldur's Gate 3 suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

During a recent playthrough on his YouTube channel, he was asked if he thinks there’s a way to replicate Souls-like descriptions in books. “I’ve wondered that. I really have,” Sanderson replies.

After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation's PC efforts are paying off, if the latest U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report from analyst group Circana is any indication. That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year. 
It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few types of media hook me like a good documentary. The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December 2023, Epic Games launched the next chapter of Fortnite, one of the most popular games of all time, with a huge virtual performance featuring Eminem, his avatar landing on a stage in front of fans in a far-off world. Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age features a ton of different customization options. Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbase Commander, one of the very last games ever created in the SCUMM engine, is now finally supported and ready for public testing!
Although not an adventure game, Moonbase Commander, developed by Humongous Entertainment (creators of Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Backyard Sports, etc.) is a turn-based strategy game that isn’t like any other strategy games at its time.  The main objective is to prevent your opponents from taking over a planet before you can.  Its unique aim, timing of your power, and launch aspect makes this one of the most “easy-to-learn, hard-to-master” type games.  You can easily spawn other hubs from your central hub, spawn collectors at the energy pools, fire projectiles at your opponents’ hubs, the list goes on!  It even has a custom map editor, which allows…]]></summary>
