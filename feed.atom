        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the City of Tomorrooooow
The fast-paced, hypercolor, dodgebrawl locale of Knockout City has officially gone free-to-play on both PC and console platforms. The spunky, punky title — previously published by EA before handing over duties to developer Velan Studios — made the announcement as the game celebrates the launch of its sixth season of content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH9Wt7DJrv4
Originally launching in May 2021, Knockout City combines the brutal, playground "fun" of dodgeball with wild superpowers, a large, colorful playing area, and a cast of dynamic, hyperactive players. Teams battle it out across five maps and six distinct modes, utilizing strategy, teamwork, surprise, and an array of gimmicked spheres to outsmart and outthrow the opposition, with the ultimate aim of being the last team standing that doesn't have a ball-shaped dent in the fo'head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPPd-7QOsBI
Knockout City Season 6: City of Tomorrow brings some dope new content to the game including an expanded Hideout, overhauled maps, the tricky Boomerang Ball, and new power-ups including the Starfruit Special drink. Additionally, a variety of new cosmetic items have been added to the shelves of the in-game store, with new clothes, accessories, hairstyles, and vehicles just waiting for your... erm... "Holobux." Be sure to check out the official patch notes for all of the hot deets.
Knockout City is now free-to-play on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. All players who have previously purchased the title (and logged in at any time before June) will also receive a special "Loyalty Royalty Bundle", which is filled with exclusive in-game content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also arriving on November 18 with the game
In case you haven't heard, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is confirmed for a November 18, 2022 release date. And in classic franchise fashion, it's going to have at least one collector's item/piece of bling for it — and it won't be the last! I'm talking about the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet double pack.
Depending on the region, the offer varies a bit, but it's still early yet. Hopefully we'll get confirmation of some sort of collectible hardware in the future, too. And in a hail Mary-esque situation, something as wacky as the Z-Ring. I'm assuming a fleet of Lechonk plush toys are already being made by the millions as of today.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet double pack info:
So in the UK/Europe, there seems to be a "Golden Dual Game Card SteelBook version," confirmed by this tweet from Nintendo UK:
https://twitter.com/nintendouk/status/1532018639565627399?
In the US, it will be delivered as a standard "Double Pack," which will be up for pre-order at a later date: "a double pack that includes both games will be available later on the Pokémon Center website and at participating video game retailers." The official Nintendo store also has a listing for a digital double pack that clocks in at $119.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World opened in Universal Studios Japan last year, and word of mouth (and various YouTube videos featuring walkthroughs and more) says it’s a great theme park addition. Universal is clearly a fan of it because Super Nintendo World expansions have received the greelight at both Universal Studios Hollywood and at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida. 
Now, we know the first Super Nintendo World in the U.S. will open in early 2023 in Hollywood. This news comes by way of the official Universal Studios Hollywood Twitter account, which revealed the early 2023 timeframe today alongside a picture that reveals Mario is no longer the short king he’s always been. Instead, he has extra long legs that – I’m going to be honest – ain’t right. Luigi is the tall one, Universal! Not Mario!!
Get ready, #SuperNintendoWorld is coming to Universal Studios Hollywood in early 2023. pic.twitter.com/pCYaeHgWsq
June 2, 2022
This Twitter account also posted a quick teaser of the Mario Kart ride that will be at Super Nintendo World when it opens next year, and it looks amazing. It features not just traditional animatronics and in-ride sculptures but digital elements, too, in the form of screens and some kind of special glasses. Universal says we’ll be able to “ride through iconic courses, throw shells, and collect coins to beat Team Bowser” in the ride.

June 2, 2022
While waiting for this theme park addition to open, read about the Super Nintendo World already open in Japan and then tour the park with Shigeru Miyamoto. Read about how Universal Studios Japan and The Pokemon Company are teaming up to create a “revolutionary” theme park experience after that.

E3 was always a special event for gamers, not just because we got a whole slew of exciting new trailers, footage, and announcements for the best upcoming games, but because it was a way for us to all come together and celebrate the games that mean the most to us. While E3 may be dead for this year at least, its spirit lives on in the form of Summer Games Fest and all of the other events that are lined up in the coming months. As for us, we're back with another list of our most anticipated games, 2022 edition.

There’s been a lot of Nintendo-related music news over the past year that has had me more than a little disappointed. I like to boot up a video game soundtrack while I’m working; I’m a big fan of video game music concerts and I have a small collection of albums and vinyl that I want to keep growing. And with access to video game music the best it’s ever been, I’m generally a happy bunny.
But Nintendo has always been very protective of its properties, and that goes for the music in its games. You might remember, at last year’s Tokyo 2020 Olympics, that there was a ton of video game music played during the opening ceremony – yet none of it was from a Nintendo-owned franchise. There were plans for Nintendo to make an appearance right up until 16th June, but the Big N and The Pokémon Company apparently pulled out at the last minute.

That moment probably distracted a lot of folks from a less big, but also cool reference to the Respawn-developed video game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

“Inkbound takes players on a journey through procedurally generated storybook worlds, battling monsters that are set on unraveling the nature of reality itself,” a press release reads. “Players can dive in solo or party up via online co-oop in hybrid real-time/turn-based encounters. All the while, heroes become more powerful the deeper they progress in each roguelike run.”

What can be said about Knights of the Old Republic II that hasn't been said already? Not much!
The 2004 Obsidian classic did a fantastic job of taking up the mantle of the BioWare original, providing fans with a bigger glimpse into the Old Republic timeline. It pretty much had it all: some great twists and narrative turns, interesting mechanical and quality of life upgrades, and fantastic party members. If you haven't checked Knights of the Old Republic II out yet, note that it's also on Steam for 10 bucks (rather than the $15 on Switch).
Pac-Man Museum+, Card Shark, and Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery are also arriving on Switch this week. That last one has quite the striking title, and the "Miyazaki-inspired visuals" have me interested: you can check out the listing for that one here, and note that there are already a ton of Steam reviews to peruse.

Join Game Informer as we react live to everything shown during this State of Play presentation live on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Your host for today's exciting show is the one and only Alex Stadnik. The big man will kick off the proceedings live starting at 4:45 p.m. CT for a little preshow where he'll give you some predictions and bring the hype. But what can people expect from today's State of Play? According to the official PlayStation Blog, fans can look forward to: "exciting reveals from our third-party partners, plus a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation VR2." We know one of those games is Horizon Call of the Mountain, developer Guerrilla Games' and Firesprite's collaboration featuring one of Sony's biggest franchises.
We know PSVR2 will be featured, but what else can fans look forward to? With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance? Did I just jinx us, and now we're not getting anything listed in this article? Only time will tell, but that's why you have to tune in later today.
Thank you so much for watching. If you enjoy our watch-along streams, be sure to subscribe to our Twitch pages to get notified the second we go live and to get access to our tremendous exclusive Discord.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time to break some eggs
The next Dragon Age game officially has a subtitle. BioWare confirms today that the next game in the series will be officially titled Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
As the title and previous teasers have heavily implied, former party member Solas will be playing a big role in Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. He is, himself, the Dread Wolf who can be seen as a betrayer or savior, depending on your world view.
Either way, the story of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC firmly set him up as the next big bad in Thedas. Whatever's next for the realm, it's sure to involve the trickster god in some way.
Interestingly enough, BioWare indicates that newcomers will be able to jump right into Dragon Age with Dreadwolf. "If you're new to Dragon Age, you have no need to worry about not having met our antagonist just yet," today's announcement reads. He will introduce himself to the player when the "time is right."
https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1532406453071319045
The Dreadwolf rises
That's all the information we received today on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. BioWare confirms the next Dragon Age is not coming this year, though we are "growing closer" to the next adventure. The studio says it will be talking more about the game later this year.
BioWare has previously said it's still in production on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, so it's little surprise that its next big RPG isn't arriving this year. It's nice to have a subtitle too, so I can stop referring to it solely as "the next Dragon Age."
Still, I'm curious to see what the crew is up to, especially following the comment about newcomers. The Dragon Age games have historically carried save data and decisions across games. BioWare even developed an online tool for previous games to craft world states for players.
I'm interested to see if, and how, that carryover will be handled with Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. We'll see what Solas has in store later this year.

Endling - Extinction is Forever came onto our radar about a year ago, featuring in some of the Summer season's online showcases. Developer Herobeat Studios has been working away on it since, and now it's confirmed to be landing at retail and digitally on Switch this Summer, on 19th July; it'll cost $29.99 | €29.99 | £24.99, but digital pre-orders are going live today and will offer a 10% discount for a limited time.
As you'll be able to gather from the trailer, it tells a rather harrowing tale of a fox and her cubs trying to survive in an increasingly dangerous world. The game will have a very clear message about the need to protect the environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the mainline Pokémon games, there’s always a professor, and they’re always a mentor. It’s practically inviolable at this point. But some fans think the (hot) professors in this year’s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet might actually be the villains. Yes, this is just a theory, but it’s not as far-fetched as you’d think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mushroom Kingdom comes to Hollywood
When Universal Studios Japan announced the new Super Nintendo World a few years back, gamers lost their collective minds. Sure, we're used to seeing our favorite films and TV shows come to life at a theme park, but seeing a game world realized is a brand new feeling. I'm honestly shocked it took them this long, considering how well-loved, imaginative, and easily-marketable video game settings are — especially when it comes to Nintendo properties. Now, Universal is finally moving the ball down the field, because its Hollywood park is getting its very own highly-anticipated Super Nintendo World.
We knew Mario and his friends were headed our way soon, but a tweet this morning from the official Universal Studios Hollywood confirmed that the new land would be opening sometime in early 2023. A follow-up tweet also provides a short trailer for one of the upcoming main attractions of Super Nintendo World: an interactive ride called Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge.
https://twitter.com/UniStudios/status/1532394497161797635
The video shows off the ride vehicles, which are themed to look exactly like the go-karts in the game, as well as a little bit of what the actual ride experience will be like. Riders look to be equipped with glasses of some kind, and while we don't have any confirmation on the nature of what they do just yet, it looks like they combine alternate reality elements with physical set dressing on the ride to make for a fully immersive experience.
I'm lucky enough to currently live in Los Angeles, so you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be checking this out opening weekend. I was super bummed that I wouldn't be able to see the one in Japan, so I'm thrilled to see that it's coming to the states now, too. It will be interesting to see how similar it is to the original park, or if they expand at all outside of the Mario Bros. IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It starts in Minneapolis in a week, then ends in Seattle
A Nintendo Switch Road Trip tour is coming to the US, starting on June 10 through September 5. The gist is that Nintendo will allow people to play select games (Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Strikers, Kirby and the Forgotten Land), and potentially pick up SWAG and other bonuses (these aren't guaranteed, but having been to a few of these before, getting stuff like buttons/stickers are possible).
The event kicks off in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 10 through June 13. From there it'll head across the US in various cities, ending in Seattle, Washington on September 5. Here's the list of locations, and the rundown of full dates and venues can be found here:
Minneapolis, MN
Denver, CO
Milwaukee, WI
Chicago, IL
San Diego, CA
Bethlehem, PA
Raleigh-Durham, NC
Los Angeles, CA
Seattle, WA
So there's a few tips I discovered here when researching the event. While Nintendo says you don't need to register for it, you can "secure a spot" here with the Warp Pipe Pass system: in case anything goes wrong or they're at capacity, you should be good. Plan to spend "30-40 minutes" to finish the event per person, "not including any wait time."
Also note that there is a QR code bonus program. If you have a Nintendo event coordinator scan your code, you can pick up 100 Platinum Points. You can find instructions for accessing your unique QR code here. Note that the process will take you directly to your Nintendo account.
Oh, and bring "appropriate footwear" to play Switch Sports! Out of all the games, that's the one I'd want to try the most in a controlled, open setting, with plenty of room for four or more people to stretch their arms out.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/02/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-the-official-name-of-biowares-new-rpg"/>
        <updated>2022-06-02T17:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No longer shall it be called Dragon Age 4, as developer BioWare has revealed a new name for the upcoming RPG that will henceforth be known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
A blog post announcing the title also goes into one possible meaning behind it. It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being "an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games."
Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just call me the testi-killer
The Sniper Elite series really hit gold with its X-ray kills. Being a sniper is satisfying and all, but killing Nazis at a distance just lacks intimacy. With the "X-Ray" cam, you get that up-close and personal touch, and watching your shot tear through the innards of Germany’s footsoldiers is just gravy. I remember how cool it was to shoot the hats off of enemies in Goldeneye for the N64, but look at how far we’ve come with Sniper Elite 5!
Who would have guessed the series would have such legs, though? Or that Karl Fairburne would get around so much. Africa, Italy, France, Berlin? What’s next? Did he have a stint sniping on Iwo Jima scarce months before the Battle of Berlin?

Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge will be an augmented-reality kart racing game where you sit in a four-seater Mario Kart vehicle and race around a moving track.

Starting tomorrow, a new patch will be applied to the fighting game that will add balance changes to the roster, but more importantly, also add new mechanics to the game.
Patch 2.80 for Granblue Fantasy Versus is ushering in three new mechanics that will undoubtedly change the game in massive ways. First is Rush, a tactical move that dashes the character forward to quickly close the distance on the opponent and strike when they least expect it. Similarly, Backshift is a dash backward that allows for a quick escape from pressure or a dodge to use in dicey situations, like back-dashing on wakeup to foil the opposition's advanc…]]></summary>

If you haven't seen this Elden Ring boss size comparison video yet, it's definitely worth a watch. After you've finished the game, of course!
If you've been avoiding spoilers, here's a text shield! Also I made sure the header image just featured what basically amount to regular enemies, and not major bosses. In any case, the video just walks by lifeless models of the bosses, and no fights are shown until the very end.
Crafted by the Garden of Eyes YouTube channel, this one came across my desk thanks to a reader, and despite the fact that it came out in May, it still holds up as an evergreen testament to just how ridiculously large some of the bosses in Elden Ring are. Clocking in at just over eight minutes long, the video takes a player character across a boss plane, with every major enemy model on display in a line.
It starts at what amounts to minibosses (beefed-up regular enemies that double as crypt encounters), then quickly escalates from there. What's fascinating is that I distinctly remember each and every one of these battles, but I had no idea that, say, a Godskin enemy was taller than a lot of other bosses in the game. The big shocker though? Seeing how big Elder Dragon Greyoll (that thing you don't really fight so much as kill as it lays on the ground) really is.
Like all Elden Ring videos, this just makes me want to play it again — but having played once more even after getting the platinum, I think I'll focus on other games for a while!

As such, we have our first look at the PS Plus launch lineup of games ranging from PlayStation 5 to the first PlayStation, and even PlayStation Portable too, courtesy of Gematsu.
Of course, it’s important to note that since this is the lineup of games available today in Japan, there’s the possibility this lineup could be just for Japan. The U.S. lineup, which launches on June 13, for example, could be completely different. Only time will tell. However, the Japan lineup could, at the very least, be a great indication of what’s to come.

After discovering a very interesting Animal Crossing 2061 wrinkle via Redditor AdTrue4863: I have bad news for your great grandkids.
While fiddling with time traveling (changing your internal Switch clock by setting it forward or backward in time), they encountered an interesting message: "Please close the game from the HOME Menu and restart after setting a date between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2060. Meaning, if you're in the year 2061 (whether through internal clock shenanigans or in nearly 40 years), Animal Crossing: New Horizons refuses to boot up.
Obviously this is something that will probably be patched by Nintendo (or, if you're actually reading this in 2061, you can just set your clock back), but it has really interesting and entertaining implications. I mean, where will we be in roughly 40 years? Will the Switch still be as reliable? What happens if by and large, most Switch units drift? Nintendo will likely cease repairs sometime in 2030, so folks will have to seek repairs elsewhere, or hope that the "next Switch" supports backward compatibility.
It's a fun thought exercise for something that won't matter for four decades or so. But in the context of game preservation, with so many projects becoming live service-oriented or veering toward soft or hard online requirements: it's always worth pondering.

We're just a little under a month away from the unexpected murder mystery, AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative. This sequel to Spike Chunsoft's 2019 original, AI: The Somnium Files, sees the return of everyone's favourite pipe-wielding badass Mizuki, now an ABIS special agent trying to find out the truth behind the Half Body murders.
The upcoming game features a bunch of returning characters from the original, like idol and Mizuki's best friend A-set, but we'll also be meeting some new faces this time around, including Ryuki, another ABIS agent; Tama, his AI ball sidekick; Komeji, a comedian; and Kizuna, a school student.

Then, Witchbrook kind of disappeared for two years before it resurfaced in 2020 with a brand new art style. And then it disappeared again, until today, when Chucklefish released five new images of the witchin' RPG alongside a fancy new Steam page. 
“Welcome to Witchbrook,” a tweet reads. “Enjoy this magical sneak peek into the town of Mossport with these brand-new-fresh-out-of-the-oven screenshots. Wishlist now on Steam.” 

As for the Steam page, it describes Witchbrook like this: “Discover the magic around you in Witchbrook – a spellbinding social RPG! Spark life into a charming seaside town when you become Mossport’s new…]]></summary>

Sunbreak, the 'massive expansion to Monster Hunter Rise, is so close that we can almost smell the Dung Bombs. Our very own Alex Olney has even gone hands on and made a lovely preview, which you can watch above or read (in summarised form) over on this page.
Regular readers will also know that this scribe has had a phase of sharing weapon showcase videos from Capcom (check them out on the game's news feed), with an almost irritating frequency. Well, there's been a little gap, so here's a wrap-up of four videos that we haven't yet covered on these pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should be live any day now
Although it isn't fully live currently, a Fire Emblem: Three Hopes demo popped up on the Nintendo store recently. While it currently errors out if you try and download/access it, the listing clearly points to a demo reveal that will likely happen in the near future, so keep an eye out for it: especially if you pre-ordered already.
Typically, Warriors demos involve several early stages, potential access to the world map, and the ability to free play until a certain point in the game. At that point, you should be able to carry over progress into the full version. So for fans, it should be a meaty dive into what Three Hopes has to offer, and provide a glimpse into the new take on the storyline, as well as any potential gameplay adjustments.
Of course, it'll also be an important showcase for something that's deeply impacted Warriors games, especially on Switch: performance. While some can live with framerate issues, others can't, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo will need to put its best foot forward if it wants to sell more people on the game leading up to launch. Performance hasn't stopped Omega Force and company before, though!
Again, when it goes live, you'll find it here, or on the eShop proper.

Over the past few weeks, we've been getting a glut of new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailers and details, and we've now seen all three of the main houses in action. The game launches later this month and is the second Fire Emblem Musou game after Fire Emblem Warriors on the Switch and New 3DS.

Where To Pre-Order Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes On Switch

But it sounds like fans will be able to have a go at the game a little ahead of its 24th June release date. Over on Nintendo's store page, a listing for a demo of the game has appeared. There's an option to download the demo, but it's not currently live yet, so you'll have to sit patiently until you can get your hands on some chaotic Warriors action with your favourite Fire Emblem: Three Houses characters.

        <updated>2022-06-02T10:00:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, Mr. Caffeine fans...
Today will see Sony host a brand new State of Play presentation, kicking off what is expected to be another long summer of online showcases and news streaming events — in lieu of the still missing-in-action E3. However, it seems that one of the industry's biggest publishers will not be joining the party, as Ubisoft has announced that it has no live stream on deck for the coming month.
Speaking in brief comments to Axios, Ubisoft noted that it would be foregoing its usually summer presentation, and instead expects to hold its next major live stream, Ubisoft Connect, "later this year." This will mark the first time in some years that the Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, and Rainbow Six Siege publisher has not put in a showing during what would usually be "E3 month."
It should also be noted that Ubisoft did not feature on Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest partner list, a who's who of industry names that included Capcom, Atlus, Sega, PlayStation, Warner Bros., Xbox, 2K Games, and many other globally successful developers and publishers. One might assume that Ubisoft is not quite ready to reveal further details on its upcoming releases, including the development-limbo sequel Beyond Good and Evil 2, and smaller projects such as the Prince of Persia remake and Assassin's Creed Rift.
While there is no doubt that the coming months will see a vast amount of headlines, trailers, game reveals, and exciting updates, this summer's gaming extravaganza is looking a dot quieter than previous years, with companies such as EA choosing to mix their announcements in with larger shows, rather than hold their own individual live streams. This will be better in the long run for everybody, respecting the time of both audiences and the media, while allowing a tighter focus on each publisher's bigger releases over needlessly drawn-out theatrical segments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh Boy
[Update: The official PlayStation Blog has now confirmed that June's PlayStation Plus titles are indeed God of War, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker. All three titles will be available to add to your library until July 5.]
In what has now become a regular monthly event, the next PlayStation Plus offerings have been leaked ahead of their official announcement — As noted by regular spoiler billbil-kun of Dealabs, June will see PS Plus subscribers bag themselves copies of Sony's God of War, Gamemill's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Bandai Namco's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np1jPkg3R6Q
Assuming that the leak is genuine, (and there's very little reason to believe it isn't), the three titles will be available to download from June 7 until July 5. The June titles will replace May's offerings of EA's FIFA 22, Focus Entertainment's Curse of the Dead Gods, and Gearbox Publishing's Tribes of Midgard, so be sure to secure your license for these three titles before they vanish for good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yl-_LYD0ik
June will also see Sony launch its revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service. The new service offers three distinct subscription tiers — Essentials, Extra and Premium — which will afford access to a rotating library of PlayStation releases on PS5, PS4, PS2, and the original PlayStation, dependent on your membership. Sony will continue to offer up a monthly selection of "to-keep" titles for all subscribers, regardless of their respective subscription tier.

She's the first UK monarch to manage 70 years on the throne, most of the other ones having killed each other or somesuch. The country, specifically England, has responded to this by going absolutely off the boil, represented even in digi-form with a virtual street party map in Minecraft.

The 16-minute-long presentation showcased some of Sunbreak’s new areas, debut monsters, and gameplay tweaks. We also saw variations on well-known monsters that fans can encounter in the fresh experience. And while this gave us a lot to chew on, we couldn’t wait to explore all the new changes ourselves. We recently sat down with Sunbreak’s team and got a hands-on preview of the expansion, which featured two different quests, a peek at unique locales, characters, and, of course, monsters.

Monster Hunter Rise is tremendous — if you haven't played it, you only have to look at our review to see how much we loved it — so when Capcom asked if we fancied having a pop at the honking new DLC expansion titled Sunbreak, we couldn't say no.
We got to have a go at just two of the quests on offer when we visited Capcom's UK offices, one hunting a Lunagaron, and another taking down a Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate classic, a Seregios.

I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

For the third year in a row, Limited Run Games will be a part of our summer stream smoothie, so don't spoil your appetite. (And bring money. Lots of money!) The physical game purveyor is hosting its LRG3 digital showcase on June 6 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific.
For this year's showcase, Limited Run Games will be covering "over 30 awesome game trailers and physical release reveals for bespoke, high-quality collector's editions," which is par for the course at this point. You'll be able to watch along on the company's Twitch channel. Expect to see plenty of Mega64 shenanigans, as the boys are back in town.
https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1532064573771358208
We know of at least one high-profile release that'll show up: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. A tweet last month confirmed a Collector's Edition reveal at LRG3.
I feel like some of you will tune in just for TMNT, but that's just one of many games. There's plenty of room for other limited editions, and it's been great to see Limited Run (and other folks doing similar work) on the rise in spite of industry trends. As we've seen, there's still plenty of demand for physical releases — especially when they're done right.
For those of you in North Carolina (or anyone willing to travel for the sake of hard-to-find video games), Limited Run recently opened its first retail store in Cary, as pictured above. I haven't been! But have you ever had that dream where you've somehow stumbled upon the motherload — rare games as far as the eye can see — and then you wake up?
With new showcases filling out the rest of June, LRG3 won't be everyone's top priority, but it's bound to be a fun one for collectors. Let's all try to stay on budget, shall we?

Well, there's no E3 this year. Again. But there are summer live streams where E3 news would go! As such, the tradition of E3 predictions lives on. In the past, one might have asked zoo animals to divine gaming predictions for the Destructoid community but I'm a night person and hate sunlight, so I use tarot cards instead.
This year I will be using the brand new Dungeons & Dragons Tarot Deck. As a small review, the deck is both beautiful and deeply flawed. The art is done by Fred Gissubel and reminds me a great deal of the tarot drawn for Dragon Age but never had a deck realized. For the gorgeous, evocative imagery alone, the deck is worth collecting.

A new Warhammer 40,000 game was announced today, with a bit more of a role-playing vibe. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a classical, isometric-style RPG from Owlcat Games.
The trailer, shown as part of today's annual Warhammer Skulls festival, is packed with RPG signposts. It's got an isometric style, and the trailer declares Rogue Trader is the first "classic CRPG" set in the Warhammer 40K universe.
Behind this RPG is Owlcat Games, a studio that's previously worked on several Pathfinder RPGs. Both Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous seemed to do well by those who dig isometric games. And now, the team will tackle the 40K universe.

Novel concepts are worth their weight in gold, and Card Shark comes out swinging with an idea you’re unlikely to have encountered before. Set in 18th century France, players take on the role of a destitute and mute drink server who is lifted into high society by a puffed-up card cheat. Along the path to riches, a deep conspiracy is uncovered, touching the lives of everyone in upper-class society, and playing out in backroom parlors, Corsican pirate dens, and royal palaces. It’s a clever and appealing setup, but it can only carry the game so far. With gameplay that feels like a chore from begi…]]></summary>

Will It Work has many videos, breaking down how they connect disparate controllers and consoles together. There are some wild connections like the Donkey Kong bongos hooking up to an iPhone, for example, or a phone to SNES mouse.

During today's annual Warhammer festival Skulls, developer Fatshark premiered a new trailer for its upcoming co-op action game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. It looks grim, dark, and grimy. Pretty much what'd you expect in a Warhammer 40K setting.
As humanity struggles to fight back against the tides of Chaos, criminals are rounded up and sent into the fray. These Inquisition forces are basically the Suicide Squad in 40K. But you and three friends will need to touch down on the planet and try to survive.

Keep watching the skies, as THQ Nordic has announced a launch date for its hyper-destructive sci-fi sequel Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed. The new remake is available to pre-order on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X right now, ahead of its official release on all of the aforementioned platforms on August 30.
Developed by Black Forest Games — the studio behind the 2020 remake Destroy All Humans! — Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed offers a brand new, ground-up rebuild of the original 2006 PS2 and Xbox release, which sees alien clone Crypto 138 wreaking havoc in the twilight days of the 1960s. Bring intergalactic chaos to five large, open-world maps, including Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and even the far reaches of The Moon. Battle raging hippies, the KGB, and other flared monstrosities across a day-glo decade that broke all of the rules.
https://youtu.be/XEDy9365LCA
THQ Nordic lifted the lid on three editions of Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed. Because why release anything if you can't make it a little more complicated? The standard edition of the game will launch for $39.99 USD on all platforms, while a "Dressed to Skill" edition throws in a selection of DLC skins and challenge missions for $54.99. Finally, a physical collector's edition will also include a selection of as-yet-unannounced gubbins, and will retail for a staggering $399. It better include a working jetpack.
Pre-orders for all editions are now live, and anybody pre-ordering any of the versions will unlock immediate access to the multiplayer standalone title, Destroy All Humans! Clone Carnage. For those of you who aren't quite ready to commit to purchasing DAH!2: Reprobed just yet, then DAH!: Clone Carnage is also available to purchase separately, priced at $12.99.

Nearly two years ago when Mario Kart Live arrived, I said that what you got out of it will vary from household to household, and that rings true to this day. And it looks like Reddit user fiveonthakush got a lot out of it with this Mario Kart Live setup.
Their case is a masterpiece, in that it holds four playable karts, as well as four units of Switch hardware: which double as the controllers and screen in which to view the karts as they race around a real-life "track." All they'd need to do is keep the Switches charged, then carry it anywhere they want for some family fun.
The creator says the case is from mycasebuilder.com, designed with "lower foam," which they cut out based on the specifications, with a "routed lid" to ensure that the top didn't tightly press down on the karts and the Switch hardware. Interestingly, they "swapped parts on the karts" so they could tell all four apart. If you look closely, there's a green kart with a red "Mario" M on it, and a red kart with a red Mario M: vice versa for two karts that feature Luigi. That way you can more easily tell who "players one through four" are. They say that they hope to get even more use out of the game because of the case, which makes it easier to transport: and had fun putting the set together.
With that said, it's sad that Velan Studios/Nintendo never released proper "player three or player four" karts: but for Nintendo's experimentation, a lack of follow-through is par for the course (RIP Labo?). I know there is a community around the game, and I hope it gets some sort of follow-up someday.

As both a diehard Stardew Valley and Harry Potter fan, Witchbrook has been my most anticipated game for years now. While it was officially announced back in 2020, whispers of Witchbrook have been circulating since as early as 2017, so the wait has been long for this one. Although the game isn't even out yet, there's a whole subreddit dedicated to tracking any and all news that updates the fans on where Witchbrook is in development, and just when it might be coming out.
It was looking pretty bleak on there for a while without any official updates from developer and publisher Chucklefish for months at a time, but after fear that the game would be silently canceled so that the studio could focus on other projects, we've finally received some …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. 
Anthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”
“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.
The publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series.

Last year, the people at Xbox whet the appetites of LGBTQ+ gamers and allies with their wonderfully colorful and inclusive Xbox Pride controller. I know some people consider the sheer multitude of different multicolored flags that decorate the queer community to be excessive, but nerts to them. All these flags are delightful, and when you put them all together, they can become outstanding pieces of art. Last year's Pride controller is a work of art. Unfortunately, it's a rare piece of art as those beauties were only sent out to a few choice influencers and media members.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That's how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring's major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The D is Shattered.
Dontnod Entertainment, the French studio behind Life is Strange, Vampyr, and Twin Mirror, is going through something of a rebranding, and will henceforth be known by its new moniker of simply "Don't Nod". The developer made the announcement in a statement to the press this week.
"We are reintroducing the apostrophe and the space between the words to truly embrace the meaning of DON’T NOD. DON’T NOD is two words to represent our tendency to be non-conventional as a company and in the games that we create — as in, we DON’T NOD along to everyone else’s tune," writes the newly named company. "The D [in our logo] is shattered, and the N appears within it, signifying that we are not afraid to break the mold. This new logo links our games — meaningful, powerful stories — with who we are as a company."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_s94ud6Qg
In addition to the reworked name and logo, Don't Nod also unveiled a new website sporting the fresh branding. The site has a community-focused theme, and includes a section where players and fans will be able to upload content related to Don't Nod titles — such as artwork, short stories, and poetry, as well as testimonies and memories of their personal experiences with the company's releases. The company also recently won plaudits for introducing "work-from-home" options for its workforce, a move that also opened up further opportunities for remote and satellite employees.
"I am very proud of the journey that DON’T NOD has been on over the past 14 years, " said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. "The company has evolved in many ways with a strong will to lead the way in creating and publishing meaningful entertainment, through original and relatable stories, which empower our talents and players to inspire change, however small. This new brand’s visual overhaul will help us convey our core identity."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sega debuted roughly 30 seconds of Sonic Frontiers open-world gameplay and today, you can now watch more than seven minutes of gameplay, courtesy of IGN. It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. 
Right off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:


As you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems to utilize enemy materials for crafting reagents
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem crafting returns, as shown in a new tweet from the game's official Japanese Twitter account.
Enabled by party member Riku, you'll use items gathered from enemies to create the gems, which can be equipped by characters. Increased attack and recovery power are cited as bonuses so far. For Xenoblade followers, the announcement of a gem system doesn't really come as a shock — unless it's a shock in the sense that you're paralyzed by the fear of having to go through this system again.
Gems (not just in this series, but in general JRPG-dom) are polarizing, to say the least, as some involve a laborious amount of grinding, or some form of randomness. Based on what we've seen so far though this Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem mechanic seems a lot more straightforward. The example shown in the below tweet showcases players crafting a plus attack power gem, using six different ingredients, as well as a coin currency (that serves as an alternative method of crafting gems).
It's unknown where coins are acquired in-game, but it could be a sidequest currency of sorts. The three classic roles (defender [blue]/attacker [red]/healer [green]) also seem present, with a fourth category (denoted by a star and an orange gem color) that is possibly a catch-all. It's out...really soon (like a month and a few weeks!) so we'll know soon enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Blue Blur of the Wild
Today, Sega and IGN premiered a big look at the gameplay of the next Sonic game, Sonic Frontiers. Across seven minutes it shows plenty of rolling around at the speed of sound, but also some strong influence from other open-world games.
Sonic Frontiers is set to be the next big game for Sonic, and it's tackling the open-world genre. In today's footage, it's easy to see some influence from games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Alongside the literal tower that Sonic starts the clip out climbing, there are also big expanses to roam across. Plus, it seems like more than a few environmental puzzles are in store too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxJ5_ovBC_g
At one point, Sonic runs circles around some flames to unlock a sort-of radar ping. In another, he's walking across blocks in the correct order to light them up, without overlapping his trail. I think it's fairly safe to say this is drawing on some modern open-world conventions.
Power up the Sonic Cycle
One thing we've yet to see is what's tying all this together. Seeing Sonic run around in an open world is one thing, but I'm curious as to what the goals and structure of the game will be. Previous Sonic games usually fall into level-based formats with objectives and structure, but it seems like Sonic can just roam the open world for collectibles and puzzles in Sonic Frontiers.
This Sonic Frontiers gameplay is only a first look, though. There's likely more info to come as IGN has Sonic Frontiers as their First feature for the month of June. Hopefully we get a little more info about what sort of enemies, characters, and goals we're dealing with in the wide-open world of Sonic Frontiers soon.
Sonic Frontiers is aiming to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

In reality, this is actually a pair of mods. One of them is a Tifa as Yuna outfit from urbandayz. Another is a Cloud as Tidus costume from Ninjagrime12. With both mods deployed, they work in concert to allow you to live out your FFX fantasy: because of course you know you want to.
A little housekeeping: so the Cloud as Tidus mod doesn't require much legwork to get going. There's an optional "Brotherhood over the Buster Sword" mod that reworks Cloud's weapon into the FFX version from Uploaded by swifferpilled — but you don't need it. On the Tifa side, you will need to consider that you won't be able to see her hands properly as-is. You'll want to apply the "Tifa Invisible Weapons" mod from Narknon to smooth things over.
If you want, you can use the Amano Barret design to remake the whole crew! Or bask in the glory of Final Fantasy X: a game that did get a full sequel once upon a time, but deserves to live on far beyond that scope.
The post A Final Fantasy X style Cloud and Tifa FFVII Remake mod? Sure appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen motherboards are getting cheaper, which is handy if you're planning a new build around one of Intel's excellent 12100, 12400F or 12600F CPUs for gaming. One of the best deals we've spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You're missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

The new season is called City of Tomorrow, and in it, the Super-Science Symposium is back in town, and scientists from all over the world are duking it out in dodgeball to show off their wildest inventions as a result. With these scientists’ new tech comes plenty of new toys for dodgeballers to play with, which means players have a lot of new things to try out like a new Special Ball, updates to hideouts, new crew vehicles, and a new Brawl Pass that features an Among us crossover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal is finally out on mobile devices, a full day earlier than expected for some regions. 
The entire Diablo Immortal launch, which will see the game hit iOS and Android devices everywhere and PC, is still slated for tomorrow, June 2, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. If you plan on playing the first-ever, built-from-the-ground-up-for-mobile Diablo game on a phone, then head to your app store to see if it’s available.
While waiting for it to download, check out our latest gameplay from it below:


“As we prepare to launch Diablo Immortal on June 2 at 10 a.m. PDT for iOS, Android, and PC in Open Beta, some players will see Immortal propagate on the Apple App Store and Google Play beginning the morning of June 1 PDT,” a blog post reads. “This is in part due to the nature of how mobile games rollout to ensure a smooth full launch for the mobile version of Immortal. To confirm when Immortal will be fully launched for your region on all platforms, please reference the below time map.” 
The blog post mentions that the game won’t launch in some Asia Pacific regions, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, until June 22. It will launch that same day in Vietnam but only on PC in Open Beta. According to Blizzard, these regions will receive dedicated game servers to bring players better connectivity and ping. 
For more information about this rollout, including a look at Blizzard’s current roadmap for Diablo Immortal, head to this “Roadmap To Hell.” After that, read Game Informer’s review in progress of Diablo Immortal, and then check out this Diablo Immortal segment of New Gameplay Today to look at how it runs on both mobile devices and PC.

Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

To do so, rather than featuring an athlete on the cover of Madden NFL 23, EA Sports created three distinct covers to celebrate the three major areas of John Madden's contributions to the game of football.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer for Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet and it reveals the new professors, four-player co-op capabilities, the new legendaries, the box art for the two games, and more. 
It also reveals that Pokémon Violet and Scarlet will hit Switch on Nov. 18. On that day, you'll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you're playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you're playing Violet (right).
You can check them out in action in the trailer below:


Shortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won't be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we'll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.
Plus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. 
The trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation's two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. 

For more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen's starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far. After that, read up on all the version differences and exclusives in Pokémon Violet and Scarlet revealed thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You just heard the collective sigh of relief from achievement hunters all over the world because their hobby just got a lot more convenient. 
That’s because after a new Xbox update, you'll be able to view secret achievements from wherever you’re playing an Xbox game. Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. 
“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity > Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. 
“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” 
Here’s a look at how it works: 
While waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that.

Much of Diablo Immortal is designed to look, sound, and feel like Diablo 3, and in my time leveling a Crusader, it nails those lofty expectations effortlessly. Never once during my time slaying the minions of evil have I felt like this was a reskin of another mobile game, imposter using the Diablo name, or that it f…]]></summary>

The impeccable graphics and thought-provoking narrative shine so brightly in this puzzle/adventure title that the game’s defects, like the frustrating lack of direction, stand out in grimy, stark contrast. The moment I began playing, I was under the aquatic world’s monochromatic and disquieting spell.

But having mentioned the later, and because people who like Gormenghast really bloody like Gormenghast (a reasonable position), and respond to its evocation like Chekhov's dogs let loose at the eleventh annual Ringing World National Youth Championship competition, I'm now going to have to temper expectations back down.

Podíváme se také na hrozivou elektroinstalaci z facebookových videí a pro milovníky vintage audiotechniky ukážeme krásnou studii NASA zabývající se důvody selhání starých tranzistorů. A samozřejmě mnoho dalšího...

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 2. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00. Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, dorazte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

This year's #SummerGameFest will feature events, activities and updates for fans from more than 30 partners, with more to be announced.

In the tweet posted above, Keighley states that SGF will feature events and updates from over 30 partners, with more to be announced. For now, the line-up includes: 
2K
Activision
Atlus
Bandai Namco
Bloober Team
Capcom
Coffee Stain
Deep Silver
Devolver Digital
Digital Extremes
Dotemu
EA
Epic Games
Focus Entertainment
Frost Giant Studios
Humble Games
Level Infinite
Mediatonic
miHoYo
Netflix
PlayStation
Raw Fury
Samsung Gaming Hub
Sega
Square Enix
Skybound Games
Steam
Studio MDHR
Tribeca Festival
Warner Bros. Games
Xbox
Now that we have a clearer idea of which companies have something to show, the speculation can begin. Will Bloober Team reveal its long-rumored Silent Hill project or its already announced Layers of Fear sequel? Will Dotemu finally spill the beans on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge release date? Square Enix has already teased something Final Fantasy VII-related for the event; could it be a Remake 2 reveal? We'll get all those answers and more next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers was teased way back in 2019 before it was teased once again in 2021. It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. 
This new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: 


As you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon. 
What do you think of this gameplay teaser? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has begun to announce its upcoming slate of Game Pass titles for next month, with six games joining the service in the opening days of June. Sharpen your blades and get ready for plenty of action with the three big games coming to the subscription service over the next week. Ubisoft is providing two games with For Honor: Marching Fire Edition hitting tomorrow and Assassin's Creed Origins arriving on June 7, just in time for Series X owners to enjoy the new 60FPS update. Koei Tecmo is also bringing Ryu Hyabusa's remastered trilogy of 3D adventures to Game Pass with the June 2 addition of Ninja Gaiden Master Collection. 
Here's the full list of Game Pass additions coming in the first part of June:
For Honor: Marching Fire Edition – June 1 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Ninja Gaiden Master Collection – June 2 (Console and PC)
Assassin's Creed Origins – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Chorus – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Disc Room – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Spacelines from the Far Out – June 7 (Console and PC)
With new games joining the service, others are often leaving as well. Get your game time in with the following titles that will be gone from Game Pass on June 15:
Darkest Dungeon (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Greedfall (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Limbo (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Worms Rumble (Console, PC, and Cloud)
This newest Game Pass update only stretches into the first week of June, but keep in mind that Xbox and Bethesda are holding their joint showcase of upcoming games on June 12. Keep your eyes peeled on that presentation and Game Informer for more updates on what's coming to Game Pass in the future.]]></summary>

It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

        <updated>2022-05-31T15:17:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising launched in Steam Early Access on May 17, and the vampire action survival game has quickly taken the world by storm. Developer Stunlock Studios revealed that the game has pushed past 1.5 million copies sold in only two weeks.
Stunlock doesn’t provide an exact sales number, but 1.5 million+ is a remarkable feat for a game technically in its infancy. V Rising has been popular on Twitch and has garnered strong reviews thus far. The game puts you in the undead boots of a newly awakened vampire who must build their empire. Similar to games like Valheim, players explore an open world in search of resources (either from nature itself or by pillaging villages) to construct a castle and become the second coming of Dracula. Combat pushes you to use your supernatural abilities to take down a host of otherworldly creatures, and you can tackle the game alongside friends in co-op. You can also attack other players’ castles in PvP. 


As an Early Access title, V Rising will continue to receive updates and improvements over the next several months. The game’s Steam page states that Stunlock hopes to launch the game in 1.0 within the next 12 months, barring any changes.]]></summary>

Steelrising is one of these Soulslike seeds hoping to sink into our screens, sprout, and take root not only in the innards of our Panasonics, but our minds too. From what I've seen, it stands a chance of survival in a saturated land.

More specifically, Monument Valley: Panoramic Edition and Monument Valley II: Panoramic Edition will hit PC on July 12. Both of these illusion-based geometric puzzle games were released on iOS and Android devices in 2014 and 2017 respectively, and now, for the first time ever, they’ll be playable on non-mobile devices. As the name implies, the view of the game, which is longer than it is horizontal as a result of being mobile games, will be shifted to account for PC monitors. Instead, both Monument Valley games will be presented in a wide view and you can see what that looks like below thanks to the series’ art director:

May 31, 2022
Both games can be added to Steam wishlists right now and unsurprisingly, in order to run these games on your PC, you’re not going to need much horsepower at all. As for price, each will be available for $7.99 and both games will come with their previously released DLC, which incudes Ida’s Dream and Forgotten Shores for Monument Valley and The Lost Forest for Monument Valley II. 
While waiting for July 12, read Game Informer’s Monument Valley review and then read Game Informer’s Monument Valley II review.

The 60 FPS patch for Assassin's Creed Origins is now live. 
Here are some notes about the patch from an Assassin's Creed community manager: 
"Hey everyone,

PC: ~2.9GB
Xbox One: ~3GB
PlayStation 4: ~8.2GB

Game Improvements:
Added 60 FPS support when running the game on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.

Original story, 5/31/22:
Last December, Ubisoft announced a new-gen performance update was coming to Assassin’s Creed Origins and we now know that it’s coming this week.
On June 2, Bayak’s revenge quest across Ptolemy-era Egypt will run even better thanks to the addition of 60 FPS gameplay. The update will be available for those who play the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Origins’ successor, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, received the same current-gen FPS boost last August. 
You've been waiting, and now the winds of Egypt are calling....

However, a lesser-known series that's produced some under-the-radar experiences is returning. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is launching on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and iOS and Android devices this winter. 
The instruments change, but 30 years later the melody remains the same.

May 31, 2022
Minstrel Song dropped exclusively on PlayStation 2 in 2005. The updated visuals (changed from bit art to 3D) don't do much to improve the very bizarre character designs, but fans of the series that never got to play it more than a decade ago will finally get to test their skills with the game's combat and class systems. 
Minstrel Song itself is a remake of the original Romancing SaGa game released on the Super Famicom in 1992. The narrative follows eight adventurers as they try to stop the resurgence of an ancient deity of darkness. 
The Game Informer archives reveal that Joe Juba gave Romancing SaGa a 5 out of 10 and said that the game vied for the worst RPG of the year. Hopefully, the remaster gives it a second lease on life. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered drops on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and mobile devices later this year.]]></summary>

The trailer will go live at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET tomorrow, June 1, on the official Pokémon YouTube trailer. As for what to expect, that remains unknown as the tweet announcing this news says to tune in to the channel "for the latest on Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet." If it's like trailers in years past, we'll likely learn more about the world of Gen 9, including some new looks at Pokémon, locales we'll be visiting, and, if we're lucky, a look at the two main legendaries that will appear on the boxes of these two Switch games.

I'm hoping to see the legendaries we'll be encountering and a release date. We only know the games are releasing in "Late 2022." That likely means somewhere in the October through November timeframe if this gen follows previous generations' steps. Still, I'd love to get official confirmation of when I'll be playing this game and picking Quaxly, the best starter, to join me on my adventure. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about the original Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet announcement, which included our first looks at the three starters this time around. Then, check out all of the Pokémon confirmed for these games thus far. Check out this breakdown of all the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet version differences and exclusives revealed after that.

In 2015, Shouldice closed his eyes and jumped. However, when asked why he made that decision, he initially hesitates. 
“Why indeed?” Shouldice answers after a beat with a chuckle and a dramatic tone that suggests Tunic’s development cycle was a long one. There is no single incident he can point to that spurred him into making his choice. Instead, several factors, including how much he enjoyed making past one-off projects and his dwindling excitement for his job, influenced his decision to strike out on his own. His departure wasn’t without uncertainty.

I landed on the outskirts of Lipovka and, with the devastating SCAR-L, made quick work of enemies. There were brief moments of gratification, but securing that delicious Chicken Dinner tested my patience for dozens of hours and proved too frustrating. Fortnite’s cartoonish aesthetic and enticing crossovers scratched my casual FPS itch, but the base-building mechanic constantly shattered combat momentum. Warzone’s sensory overload was downright overwhelming. With arena sizes that seemingly rivaled open-world games, a high combatant count, and annoying purchasable killstreaks, Call of Duty’s battle royale reminded me that less is more.

Game Informer: Can you tell us about MultiVersus? What’s the quick pitch of it?
Tony Huynh: MultiVersus is a cooperative platform fighter. It's free to play. And it's a game that has a lot of the barriers removed, that's really easy to pick up, but also a really smooth, gradual mastery curve into the game. Its focus is on cooperative team-based gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wondered if people in the world of Star Wars play sports that don't involve racing repulsorcrafts, we now know that they play at least one: Blitzball. 
No, you didn’t misread that – it says Blitzball, you know, the underwater hockey-like sport played by Tidus, Wakka, and others in Final Fantasy X. That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. 
#6: There's a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA
May 17, 2022
As you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? 
If you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter. 
For more about Star Wars, watch the new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and then watch this new Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 2 trailer. After that, read our breakdown of all the new details we learned about The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, a new series starring Jude Law.

I somehow missed it in 2013, and as the years went by, I realized maybe I just wasn’t that interested in it. However, I couldn’t shake the idea that I had a GTA-sized gap in my gaming knowledge, especially as I write news stories seemingly every month about its massive sales numbers, which somehow keep increasing, the continuous flow of GTAV Online content, and more. 
GTA V is as prevalent today as it was in 2013, so when the new-gen editions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were released in March, I decided to finally give it a go. And, unsurprisingly to most reading this probably, it lived up to the hype. So much so that I’m still playing it today, more than two months later. I love playing through the game’s …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s Memorial Day, and to celebrate the long weekend, we’re shining the spotlight on the asymmetrical multiplayer genre. This category features games where two groups face each other, but each side has unique, sometimes wildly disproportionate, skills and goals. As evidenced by many of the year’s recently released and upcoming titles, like Evil Dead: The Game, IllFonic’s Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleased, and Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the genre is seeing a resurgence. There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off an exciting weekend of tons of news from Star Wars Celebration 2022, including the reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and details about The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, a new trailer for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch has arrived. 
In it, we get new looks at the Bad Batch, of course, as well as Darth Sidious aka The Emperor and Wookiee Jedi youngling Gungi. With a look at Gungi, we now know that he survived Order 66, which sought to kill and end the entirety of the Jedi. The trailer also reveals that we can expect Season 2 of The Bad Batch to drop onto Disney+ this fall. 


As you can see in the trailer above, the titular Bad Batch of heroes are still doing their thing, searching for what they want to do now that they’re free. Of course, meanwhile, Sheev Palpatine’s empire is on the rise and the crew will need to deal with that while extending their helping hands to others. It looks like they’re after new allies, too, which hopefully includes Gungi. 
For more about Star Wars, read about the newly announced series, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, which will star Jude Law, and then read about how the Rogue One prequel series, Andor, will hit Disney+ in August. After that, check out the first ever Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel a bit sorry for Crossfire: Legion, which appears to have suffered the worst launch imaginable for a fast-paced competitive RTS game. Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone has that Elden Ring boss they really enjoyed facing off against, even if they kicked your butt over and over again, including the game’s director and From Software CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki. 
His favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, according to a new Xbox Wire Japan blog post, as translated by IGN. As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. 


“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” 
He said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). 
“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” 


I was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast Four Word is a clever idea. It's a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter. So if the starting word is AHEM, as it was yesterday, you could change the first letter and enter THEM. 

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sneak peek at an upcoming music track from Splatoon 3. Nintendo describes "Sea Me Now" by in-universe band Front Roe as having "a melodious, punkish sound" that has been "swimming up the charts in Splatville lately." True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon's soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.
You can listen to "Sea Me Now" by Front Roe below.


The Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don't know who the figurehead announcers of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.
Splatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9. For more on what this third entry in the franchise brings to the battlefield, check out the latest gameplay trailer here or learn about its improvements on the series' wave-based cooperative mode, Salmon Run: Next Wave, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we'd like to announce the next season officially. 
Season six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or "Stylish Action"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:
Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 2
Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening
Devil May Cry 4
DmC: Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 5
Video Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. 
Last season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry. 
Listen and subscribe to Video Gameography on your favorite podcast service. If you enjoy the show, don't forget to give us a five-star review, and make sure to let us know what you enjoy about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords is coming to Switch on June 8. This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.
The Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.
We recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying "Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables."]]></summary>

He starred in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order alongside Cal Kestis, will be in the just-announced sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and may have even been in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett.

Lego announced this BD-1 set at Star Wars Celebration and showed off what it can do. The set consists of 1,062 pieces and is a part of Lego's recent droid line, which consists of R2-D2, D-O, and a Probe Droid. BD-1's legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:
Lego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year. This set comes with minifigures of Cassian Andor, Luthen Rael, and inspector Syril Karn. The Mobile Tac-Pod is piloted by Karn.]]></summary>

Batgirl AKA Barbara Gordon is one of Gotham Knights’ four playable characters alongside Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in a story that sees the Bat family defending Gotham after Bruce Wayne’s death. In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle. In DC's 2011 New 52 comic reboot, Barbara regains her mobility due to an experimental surgery followed by physical therapy/training.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SPOILERS AHEAD!
Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, you should avoid going any further. The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.
These announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.
The trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.
Hasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.
Hasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.
Hasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.]]></summary>

EA and Respawn Entertainment have officially revealed the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order. This new title will continue the story of force-wielder Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
A brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez's ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert. Other notable characters are the potential antagonist who narrates the trailer…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. 
Yesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: 
TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.
May 26, 2022
Valve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.]]></summary>

The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

In a moment of high folly, perhaps hubris, Unexplored 2 has arrived to these lands to preach the benefits of novelty and moreish dungeon delving. This is a chonker of a roguelike RPG, in which long-held assumptions about how the genre ought to be designed are thrown away, while others are strictly obeyed. The designers of this colourful 'splorer have rubbed their chins and decided to see what our beloved randomly generated death tales would look like without two sacred cows: money and meters.

According to the mission summary for Ungola: “No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.” That’s enough to put anyone off.

Ne'er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it's our favourite video games that made big swings but didn't quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling "jurassic" properly first time; I've never been able too. 
Diversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is "about as big as an Alsatian" and "basically a bin-bag full of girders". So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.

It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going 'cheap' on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

And now the game's first season has - *double checks* - finally arrived.
So, Ollie, Liam, and I strapped on our skates and jumped into a few games to see how it's getting on. Ollie had some experience with the game before, while Liam and I went in totally blind.

If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joining the scandalously overlooked Blast-Axis and the more recognised Overload in the pantheon of Descentants this week, it's Zerograve. Is this a genre revival now? Three solid contenders (that I'm aware of) must surely bring us close.
It's fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don't want to start on a downer so let's say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

Keighley made the comments in a Twitter Spaces cast over the weekend, probably to everyone's great relief. Of course, he immediately followed up by explaining that the publishers with fewer games to show will be rolling their presentations into Keighley’s own Summer Game Fest, as well as first-party shows such as the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech MX Master is an incredibly popular series of office mice, and today the latest MX Master 3 has dropped from its usual price of $100 to just $55 at Office Depot. That's a massive discount, achieved via a combination of an Office Depot price drop to $75, a 25% off code (SELFMADETECH) and a 30% back rewards code (90893995). 
This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
