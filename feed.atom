If you didn't pick up Hot Wheels Unleashed at launch (and recent sales didn't tempt you), then October should be a good month for PlayStation Plus. Milestone's well-liked arcade racing game joins the lineup for PS Plus Essential subscribers alongside NetherRealm's superhero fighter Injustice 2 and the minimalist action-shooter classic Superhot.
You can follow those links and claim the games starting on Tuesday, October 4.
Hot Wheels Unleashed has some cool locations, complete with nostalgic plastic orange tracks, and the cars look authentic, too.

Gameloft has given Disney Dreamlight Valley players a heads-up as to what updates to expect in the game over the coming weeks — yes, it really is October very soon (less than a week, even!). And perhaps the biggest thing to note is that the iconic villain from The Lion King, Scar, is coming to the game "in around 3 weeks".
Previously announced for Fall 2022, it looks like Scar will be hitting that window comfortably. Though the developer can't promise the exact date of Scar's arrival in the game, he will be coming alongside a slew of bug fixes for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again.

Endless nightmares, hand-drawn weirdness, and twin-stick shmup action sound like a pretty bizarre list of ingredients for a video game concept, but that hasn't stopped Japanese indie studio Neotro from mixing 'em up and creating the fascinating new release, NeverAwake, which launches today on PC.
NeverAwake is a twin-stick shmup set within a terrifying, never-ending sleep. A young girl, Rem, is plagued by a litany of daily troubles, all of which have suddenly chosen to manifest themselves into her dreams as unholy nightmares. Now trapped within a dungeon of her own plights and worries, Rem is forced to face each and every one of her fears, conjuring up an array of firepower and other abilities to take down the nasties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-HMu7sdhas
Be it violent neighborhood dogs, the mean girls from high school, trips to the surgeon, or even those horrid vegetables she has to eat at mealtimes, Rem must steel herself against her own brain spiders, conquering these demons once and for all if she is ever to escape this literal nightmare and return to the waking world. NeverAwake boasts around 80 looped levels of action, complete with an array of grotesque bosses, hand-drawn visuals, an arsenal of dynamic weaponry, and even multiple endings, all painted against relentless, blood-pumping shmup action.
NeverAwake is available now on PC via Steam. You can also purchase the new title bundled with a digital artbook and the game's soundtrack. For console fans, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports of NeverAwake will launch in January 2023, with physical editions to follow on both platforms.

Ubisoft's multiplayer piracy game Skull and Bones is getting another delay. Today, the publisher confirms that it's charting a course for Skull and Bones to launch on March 9, 2023.
The team attributes work being done polishing and balancing the experience ahead of its release. "To give you the best possible experience we've decided to take a little more time to make sure we can deliver exactly that," the statement reads.
Kotaku, which broke the news just ahead of its official confirmation, reports that a recent Skull and Bones technical test ended on September 19. A source who was involved in the test told Kotaku that while the gameplay was "more refined" than previous ones, overall player progression still seemed "shallow."
Ubisoft confirms it plans to host an open beta of Skull and Bones in the near future. No date's been set for that yet.

A pirate's life for me
Skull and Bones had finally locked in a firm date for this year, set for November 8. The piracy sim has spent years in development, experiencing several delays and pushbacks along the way. Its studio, Ubisoft Singapore, was also the subject of reports about its internal culture, alongside broader issues reported at Ubisoft.
While it's been floating around in the water for a while, the November release seemed optimistic. Skull and Bones was one of the games featured at the recent Ubisoft Forward. With a good chunk of gameplay and showcase spotlight, Skull and Bones seemed set to sail.
Ubisoft also rolled out a bunch of its plans for Assassin's Creed and more at that showcase. As for this year though, there is still Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. And yes, the Rabbids talk in this new one.
Skull and Bones is still planned as a current-gen console game, arriving on PC, Stadia, Luna, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on March 9, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wiglett wobbles but it won't fall down
A new Pokemon has been revealed for upcoming Switch entries Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and it's a tall, wiggly one. Wiglett is a new Pokemon for the Paldea region.
Teased today in a new video on the World Pokemon Ecological Society site, Wiglett joins the Paldean lineup. You can sit through the lecture online, which also shows some other regional Pokemon like Paldean Wooper, or just check out the video below via Serebii.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQoVAMGli0E
Now, astute viewers may note that Wiglett shares some similarities with longtime Generation 1 mainstay Diglett. The burrowing Pokemon has a recognizable look, and Wiglett does indeed look a lot like Diglett. The video calls attention to this fact, too.
As it goes on to stress though, this Pokemon is clearly different. It's longer, for one. And it lives near water, in the sand.
"The form and movements indeed look like Diglett, but they are probably different Pokemon," the video states. So there you go.
A new region to explore
We've seen a bunch of the new monsters in store for this new mainline Pokemon entry. There's the neon monkey Grafaiai, the absolute perfection of Lechonk, and the two new box art Legendary Pokemon. Those two even act as your rideable mounts for the new game, helping you travel across the land of Paldea.
The extra travel will help, as there's a lot to do in Scarlet and Violet. There are essentially three main storylines, with one following the usual Gym battles and others dealing with different situations in the region.
As for Wiglett, it's an interesting design, if a little unsettling. It looks like Diglett was rolled out like dough. Still, the little mole Pokemon was a fun one to have around in the original generation, and these goofy monsters seem fun too.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

That said, the Prime Early Access Sale isn’t purely a prelude to the anything-goes chaos of Black Friday. It’s more like a Prime Day 2, in that it’s an Amazon-only event, with all the best deals set to be require Amazon Prime membership to access. That’s right, it’s one of those.

Another Splatoon 3 patch is scheduled to be released on September 30, thanks to heads-up on Nintendo of Japan's support site.
The core focus of this patch is to address communication errors (disconnects), which reared up quite a bit after launch, into the most recent Splatfest. Three fixes address specific weapon/button combination bugs, amid other issues (like game crashes when using the locker system in a specific manner). Thankfully, this patch will retroactively fix several problems, including a catalog (a seasonal reward track) bug.
As a reminder, Nintendo plans on updating Splatfest matches more in the future. Keep in mind that the below patch notes are roughly translated, but they get the point across. Once the patch is actually out, typically in the early m…]]></summary>

We never really expected to write about anything like this, but Automaton Media has reported on a rather unusual fan-made Kirby card game. That seems relatively harmless on its own — despite the fact that it's a card game featuring Kirby, a pretty huge Nintendo property, that was being sold on the Japanese marketplace BOOTH — but when we tell you there's a micro bikini-clad Chef Kawasaki, you might raise an eyebrow.
Chef Kawasaki’s Microbikini Karuta is based on 'karuta', a type of Japanese playing card that was introduced to the country by Portuguese traders back in the 1600s. There are two types of karuta — Uta-Garuta, the former working with a much larger deck with the latter aimed more at children. Nintendo itself used to sell these kinds of cards as far back as 1890. Tofuga has a pretty excellent summary of just what karuta cards are if you're curious about the details.

Two titles from Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures anthology have received current-gen upgrades on PlayStation and Xbox — As noted by VGC, the upgrades appear to be free to all players who currently own the requisite PS4/Xbox One editions of 2019's Man of Medan and/or its 2020 follow-up, Little Hope.
The new PS5 and Xbox Series X editions of the creepy horror releases will feature improved visuals and reduced load times. In addition, a new update released for all versions of the games includes a litany of tweaks and features. These include an improved U.I.; new difficulty and QTE settings; improved walking speeds for certain sequences and characters; updated event triggers; and some new accessibility options, which include more sizing choices for the games' subtitles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD60VTe7VC8
Man of Medan also receives a revised chapter, "Flooded", which introduces new gameplay elements and a selection of possible new deaths for the seafaring adventure's climax. The third title in the horror anthology, House of Ashes, is already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is thus unlikely to receive a similar tech upgrade. As for the future of the franchise, several titles were trademarked by Supermassive earlier in the year, including O Death, The Craven Man, Directive 8020, Intercession, and finally Winterfold.
I really want to play them all, truly. But I am, unfortunately, a massive scaredy cat.
The Dark Pictures Anthology is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game's reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You'll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you're someone who's a fan of Capcom's long-running Monster Hunter series.

Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S.

This, combined with the account's verified status, definitely makes us think that we are looking at the real deal here, and thousands of followers seem to agree.

SNK has announced the release date for the next team of DLC fighters headed toward its fab scrapper The King of Fighters XV — Team Samurai, consisting of Samurai Shodown stars Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Darli Dagger, will be available to download on PC and console platforms from October 4.
The new faction is, obviously, something of a crossover affair, and will see the SamSho posse step up to the plate against KoF's finest. I'm not 100% sure how Queensbury Rules Darli's enormous saw-sword is in a fistfight, but given that the KoF krew have literal superpowers, we can probably let it slide. While Haohmaru and Nakoruru are series veterans, this is only Darli's second gaming appearance, having made her debut in the ace 2019 Samurai Shodown release.

Team Samurai will represent the fourth batch of DLC characters to join KoF XV's enormous roster since the title's initial launch earlier this year. The next season, which will kick off in 2023, has already promised to bring about the return of some KoF veterans. These include Kyo Kusanagi's well-meaning protege Shingo Yabuki, and the honorable taekwondo expert and criminal reformer Kim Kaphwan. Given Street Fighter 6's imminent launch and its wickedly redesigned Juri, it looks like it is going to be a fine year for windy, billowing taekwondo pants.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms — Additionally, Samurai Shodown 2019 will receive a rollback netcode update next spring, which will hopefully bring about a resurgence of interest in the solid, if misunderstood, fighting title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The same old song and dance.
More than twenty years after its initial inception, chances are you know by now whether or not the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise is for you. Featuring rhythmic gameplay via four methods of control (buttons, touch screen, motion controls, or the drum accessory itself), the new entry from Bandai Namco — Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival — does little to freshen up the tried-and-tested formula, but instead focuses on providing more of the same for existing fans.
It’s a largely successful approach, but those hoping for a more in-depth gameplay experience similar to something like Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack may find Rhythm Festival a tad lacking.

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch's hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing "approximately 100 matches," a…]]></summary>

Harvestella is one of about ninety (haha, joking) farming sims launching on the Switch in the coming months, so naturally Sqaure Enix will be keen to show off more of the game and get the hype train rolling ahead of its official release on November 4th.
We've already been treated to a demo (and be sure to tell us what you think of it!), but Square Enix has now lifted the lid on a whole heap of features, focusing on the beautiful season of Summer and introducing us to a couple of new job classes, a new location, and some yummy food.

Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!]]></summary>

These chips will stick to the hybrid Performance core/Efficiency core design introduced by the 12th Gen Alder Lake range – probably wisely, given that includes some of the best gaming CPUs ever – but ups the E-core counts, L2 cache capacities and clock speeds. Raptor Lake will go on sale on October 20th, a few weeks after the just-launched AMD Ryzen 7000 series.
The showcase also included a few key details on the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition, the top-ranking graphics card in the long-delayed Arc Alchemist lineup of gaming GPUs. This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market. Even if it is more of an RTX 3060 rival than a cheap RTX 4080 alternative.

The astronomical rise of Splatoon 3 was always going to result in players finding exploits in the game, but we didn't think that one such problem would let you splat players through walls.
Glance over Twitter, however, and it not only seems that this issue exists, but that players are using it to their own advantage. Because of course they are. The problem stems from the Sloshing Machine — a mainstay in the Splatoon franchise which is used to quickly spread ink via projectile and following splash damage - specifically, the large hitbox that the weapon possesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smile.
Yesterday saw Player First Games' brawler MultiVersus receive a brand new update, bringing with it bug fixes, balance changes, the arrival of new fighter Rick Sanchez and, of course, a fresh new batch of character rumors, brought about by those crafty, crafty PC dataminers.
Much like with the previous update, tinkerers have been playing around with the source code of Version 1.03 of MultiVersus and have found secrets buried within. These secrets come in the form of a new "Announcers Pack," that contains narration recorded by DC Comics' Clown Prince of Crime himself, Joker. This would, obviously, suggest that Gotham City's deadliest is getting set to join the MV roster somewhere down the line — This is an inevitability that will surely come as no surprise to anybody.
You can check out the unearthed dialogue in the tweet below, posted online by @LaisulMV.
https://twitter.com/LaisulMV/status/1574811514489405440?s=20&t=ZGFG1IqOumrxd_N_YojfQA
While this is unconfirmed at this time, the dialogue appears to have been recorded by Mark Hamill, who famously played Joker in the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, and is considered one of the very best portrayals of the psychopathic criminal in the canon. Splashing out on authentic voices and top-tier characters is partly responsible for MultiVersus success, giving the platform fighter a distinction above some of the other Smash Bros. clones on the market.
Previously, dataminers had uncovered voice lines for two more unannounced stars, The Wizard of OZ's Wicked Witch of the West, and The Ghost with The Most: Beetlejuice. To date, neither of these roster additions have been referenced in any official capacity, so these characters may be waiting in the wings for further seasons. At least sweetie-pie Harley will finally be getting a measure of revenge on ol' Mr. J.
MultiVersus is currently in free-to-play open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

This means you can mete out justice with your fists and do some important detective work... and do some drone racing... and participate in some robot wars. It's Yakuza with a murder-mystery twist that's well worth your while even if you're not actually that big on Kiryu or Ichiban's antics. I'd even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

Overwatch 2 will arrive as a free-to-play game on the Nintendo Switch and other platforms very soon — on October 4th. Replacing the original Overwatch servers in the process, the sequel is set to introduce a huge number of new players to the online game increasing the prospect of disruptive behaviour and gameplay amongst the community.
Blizzard has now laid out its plan to tackle these issues via the introduction of the Defence Matrix — a new system designed to improve player interaction and deter disruptive behaviour which will release simultaneously with Overwatch 2.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

Nintendo is one of the very few publishers that seem to work way ahead of schedule — the company has been known to “sit on” fully completed games until it can find an open slot to put them in its release schedule. Not only is that almost unheard of in today’s gaming economy, but most publishers are quick to release games before they’re done cooking. We’ve seen it time and time again — Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite, No Man’s Sky, Cyberp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time
In my opinion, Trombone Champ is one of the best things to happen to gaming all year. It's easy for anyone to pick up, it's well-designed, and it's laugh-out-loud goofy. I was skeptical when I heard someone say it's a Game of the Year contender, but it only took a few minutes into playing it to make me a believer. Now that the game's popularity has launched into the stratosphere, thanks to word of mouth on social media, we're starting to see the mods slowly roll in, which is exciting for someone who is very much a fan of mods.
Mods don't just include putting Trombone Champ in VR or adding custom song maps, however — it also means that players who modify their game to take custom controller inputs are back on the scene. In this case, it's my man Rudeism, a streamer known for his modified controller setups. At this point, I'm basically his full-fledged fan. This time, he hooked up a real trombone to play its virtual counterpart in the game.
https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1574760613683023879?s=20&t=rEXbyltnL1uM9nxDgm62pA
According to his Twitter post, an "ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting." I have no idea what any of that means, but he clearly got it working in Trombone Champ, so good on him. Rudeism also states in his post that he wishes he could play the trombone IRL, which has me wondering: did he full-on buy a trombone for this bit? Those things aren't exactly cheap, so that level of commitment is admirable, to say the least. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of an illustrious career for him as a concert trombonist.
Either way, this real trombone Trombone Champ setup did exactly what it was supposed to — make me happy — and isn't that all we can ask for from our internet content these days? Now if anyone needs me, I'll be trying to top my high scores until someone mods K-pop songs into the game.

In the wake of the GTA VI leaks last week, a lot of people online made it very clear that they don’t know anything about how video games are made and embarrassed themselves online. One particularly egregious comment stated that visuals are the first thing finished in game development — which is just laughably false. Look, I’m as privy to making false assumptions as the next person, but "fans" going out of their way to harass game developers because they refuse to use Google’s most basic functionality is no one’s fault but their own.
I don’t mean to be harsh, and it is true that game development can be exclusive and gate-keepy — especially to those of marginalized backgrounds. But when it comes to situations where player expectations clash…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drug arrest actor finally faces Judgment
Once Judgment hit the PC scene, it was inevitable that players would start to poke around with the title's source code, as the PC krew are wont to do — case in point, this new mod, which restores the voice and visual likeness of actor Pierre Taki, who was patched out of the RPG shortly after its initial release.
The controversy came about way back in the spring of 2019, when the (then) 51-year-old actor was arrested for cocaine use. While no illicit substances were found at Taki's home, the actor registered positive when tested for samples. Japan's drug laws are among some of the world's most stringent, and the event led Sega to immediately halt sales of Judgment in order to remove Taki from his role as the Tojo Clan's subsidiary captain, Kyohei Hamura. Judgment would eventually return to the market, with Hamura sporting a brand new face and a re-recorded voice.
Clearly, however, his likeness and vocal performance remained buried within the source code of the PlayStation edition, as modder Timo654 has successfully adapted a similar PlayStation mod to now work with the new PC/Steam launch. The Pierre Taki mod for Judgment can be accessed via the NexusMods website, and is compatible with the popular trainer Ryu Mod Manager, which is utilized for the modding of titles within the Ryu ga Gotoku series.
As for Taki himself, the Tokyo District Court handed down a sentence of 18 months in jail for cocaine use. The sentence has a three-year suspension period. The actor has continued to work in film and television since the arrest.

The launch of Overwatch 2 is just a week away, and today Blizzard is announcing some new systems for its multiplayer shooter. Specifically, it's addressing disruptive behavior and the first-time player experience in Overwatch 2.
One major part is the First Time User Experience, or FTUE. It's designed for brand-new Overwatch 2 players, who make an account after the game has launched.
According to Blizzard, a consistent piece of feedback is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch's modes and hero pool. Under the FTUE, new users will gradually unlock pieces of Overwatch 2.
This starts with modes and chat, in the first phase. Then phase two will have players unlock all of the original Overwatch heroes. Blizzar…]]></summary>

Sony Interactive Entertainment and Insomniac Games have released a short trailer teasing the arrival of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PC. The new port of the smash-selling PlayStation title will come wall-crawling onto Steam and Epic Games Store platforms sometime this fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3wEP8kJ6Vo
Released in November 2020 as a PS5 launch title, The Marvel's Spider-Man pseudo-sequel follows the adventures of young Miles Morales, who is forced to step up his game as Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man when his home district of Harlem is severely threatened by the collateral damage of a war between greedy capitalists and a violent criminal element, led by the malevolent Tinkerer. Having only just discovered his calling as Spider-Man, Morales is pushed to hit the ground running in order to save his community from annihilation.
Much like its beloved predecessor Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales was celebrated by both video game and comic-book fans for its authentic replication of the Spiderverse and its popular cast of characters. Critics praised the follow-up's slick and engaging gameplay, fluid combat, and improved range of side-missions and activities. This new port will represent the latest in an increasing catalog of PlayStation titles that are making the leap to the PC platform — a library that also includes games from popular Sony franchises including Uncharted, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn.
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales will launch on PC this fall. It is available now on PlayStation platforms. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered is also available on PS5 and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smallfry looks great
We took the entire Splatoon 3 amiibo line for a spin at launch, but there's still three missing! A trio is due out this "holiday season," and while we don't have a full picture of what they'll unlock, we can see them up close thanks to a new YouTube video from Gaming Boulevard.
Taken at the Heroes Comic Con/Made in Asia convention in Brussels, Belgium, this past weekend; and were on display thanks to the Made in Asia portion of the convention (which features manga, anime, video games, YouTubers and cosplay).
As a reminder, these are the three that are still due in the future:
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
The general quality of amiibo has skyrocketed over the years (especially compared to the launch lineup), and you can really see the difference with these close-up shots. Smallfry (the companion in Splatoon 3 that also serves a mechanical purpose in-game) is probably going to be a fan favorite figure, as that pose looks even funnier with the real thing on display.
If I had to guess, the idol trio (Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, who all comprise "Deep Cut") could come out sometime in 2023 as Splatoon 3 amiibo: potentially coinciding with some sort of Splatoon 3 update/expansion. All Splatoon idols have been represented so far in amiibo form.
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

With the busy month of September coming to an end, publishers are shadow-dropping great-looking games on Switch eShop even in these closing days. Dropsy is the latest one, a point-and-click adventure coming hot on the tail of the most anticipated point-and-click adventure of the last decade or more, and from the same publisher, too (Devolver Digital).
We don't envy Dropsy following Return to Monkey Island so closely. There's another cool-looking point-and-clicker launching the very same day that we felt similarly bad for — one we're already working on a review for, in fact. Unfortunately, our resources aren't infinite, and with Dropsy being something of a known quantity (it launched on Steam in 2015), something's got to give.

One of the Super Famicom's most-celebrated RPGs turns 30 today in Japan. Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride was the series' first game on the 16-bit console, and even today, Dragon Quest V is fondly remembered, despite the game not receiving an official Western release until its 2009 DS port.
The Super Famicom (or SNES) isn't a slouch when it comes to RPGs — with Final Fantasy IV, V, and VI, Secret of Mana, Terranigma, EarthBound, and the seminal Chrono Trigger being just a handful of names that Dragon Quest V has to compete with to be considered one of the system's best. Even so, it still manages to stand out on a star-studded console thanks to Akira Toriyama's distinctive art style, its cosy vibes, and grand, coming-of-age story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["So that everyone has the same experience"
According to the game's producer, the approach to difficulty in Wo Long: Fallen Kingdom will be similar to how From Software (and Team Ninja itself) has handled many of their games in the past: there's one non-negotiable setting.
Speaking to MP1st, here's what producer Masaaki Yamagiwa had to say on the matter: "We’re thinking it’s good to have one set difficulty so that everyone has the same experience of overcoming a really intense obstacle and they all have that feeling of achievement, like 'I did it.' But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that." They go on to comment that you could "talk to your friends" about beating a boss, and share that experience.
They also clarify that Wo Long is "not an easy game," but they want to give players "as much freedom and agency to play it as they want." Part of that freedom and agency is the morale system, which Yamagiwa explains: "One thing that comes to mind is the morale system. You have a morale rank and as you keep increasing it you get stronger and you can use that to choose which enemies to fight, or raise it up so you can take on a harder enemy and maybe they’ll be a little bit easier now that you’re stronger." That system was actually present in the demo, and while it's confusing at first, it's another tool in the tool kit in terms of squaring up opponents. Think of it like a micro-leveling system, where you (or your enemies) can raise your power level.
In any case, the "single difficulty setting" conversation is bound to have a lot of different takes, but at least we know where Wo Long stands either way. Given Team Ninja's recent takes on action adventure romps, this isn't a surprise.

The Bat-Family's new escapades aren't far off now. Today, WB Montreal released a new trailer highlighting some of the options PC players will have for their crimefighting ventures in Gotham Knights.
In a special PC trailer, we get to see some more of the crew in action, as well as footage captured using the PC version. Gotham Knights will support 4K resolution and ultra-high frame rate options, as well as ray traced reflections.
WB Games also confirms that Gotham Knights will have Intel's XeSS A.I.-enhanced upscaling as an option. More options are shown in the trailer, including a menu full of toggles like resolution render and FPS limits, as well TAA upsample and more.
Particularly cool is the option to support ultrawide and multi-monitor PC setups for Gotham Knight. You know, so you can play the new Bat game on a Batcave-style computer layout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REicHG5ZR3U
Basically, there are a bunch of tools and toggles for making the Bat-family's fight for Gotham look really pretty.
The fight for Gotham
Gotham Knights is the new title from WB Games Montreal. Rather than following Batman like other Arkham-style games, though, this one sees the associated Bat-crew taking up his mantle after Bruce's untimely departure.
Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood are all playable, and the story looks set to focus in on the mysterious Court of Owls. Still, today's trailer is a reminder that we won't just be seeing owl masks all the time; other villains like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn will also be showing up to cause some chaos.
The added PC options are nice to see, especially as Gotham Knights is focusing on the current generation of console hardware. Hopefully it results in a good-looking Gotham to roam around in.
Gotham Knights lands for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprisingly, the fox isn’t saving a princess from a pig-man.
The opening moments of Tunic fooled us into thinking we were in for a derivative Zelda-like adventure. A diminutive fox-like character wearing a green tunic reminiscent of a certain hero wakes up on a beach. From an isometric camera angle, this fox (known as the Ruin Seeker) finds a sword and not long after a blue-and-red shield. Surely, it wouldn’t be long before we discovered boomerangs and bows to solve puzzles with – yet such item-based puzzles never came. Instead, Tunic cleaves its own identity with a handful of brilliantly unique mechanics and with combat pulled from that bottomless well of design that indie developers have yet to run dry: Dark Souls.
You’ve seen it before: a stamina bar dictates how much you, as the Ruin Seeker, can block or dodge attacks, and when you die – and you will die – an echo of your body can be recovered to regain the gold you lost upon death. Spending this gold with the proper upgrade item in hand, increases Attack, Health Points, Stamina, and so on. Your sword has a simple three-hit combo, but the complexity of combat against Slorms and Chompingnoms comes from recognising attack patterns, making use of invincibility frames in dodge rolls, and parrying if you’re brave. Throw in a handful of magic items, and the combat never grows stale in this 15-hour adventure.

While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

Ember Labs' beautiful and ethereal adventure title Kena: Bridge of Spirits is now available to purchase on the Steam platform, following on from its 2021 release on PlayStation and one-year exclusivity deal with Epic Games Store. This anniversary re-release also brings with it some fun new bonus items.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axkJPUVpjWU
Kena: Bridge of Spirits is something of a mood piece, following the zen-like adventure of the titular young spirit guide as she embarks upon a journey to guide the recently departed from the plains of reality to their eternal resting place in the spirit realm. While the title does feature world traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat elements, it must be noted that the adventure is more a trek to be enjoyed than a challenge to overcome. In any regard, Kena is a very attractive and charismatic venture, and deserving of the plaudits directed toward its visuals, audio, and satisfying mechanics.
In addition to the Steam launch, a new "Anniversary Update" is available to download for free on all platforms. The package adds a New Game+ feature, Spirit Guide trials, new Charmstones, and various accessories and outfits for our lovely protagonist. Deluxe Edition owners will get an exclusive bonus outfit. If you're yet to pick up Kena, and are intrigued by this release, then note that the Steam release is currently available to purchase at a discounted price for the first week of sale, so move fast!
Kena: Bridge of Spirits is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

Due out on all platforms on September 27, Capcom has boasted the following updates:
Viewable hitboxes
New gem colors for Puzzle Fighter
The option to see your opponent's connection status
So the first one is obviously the crown jewel, as it'll allow players to view more technical information when training, presumably across the entire array of games in the collection. It'll be fascinating to see if any new tech arises from some of the more obscure titles in those scenes. Gem color options for Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is just how it sounds, and seems like an aesthetic update, but will actually add more options for colorblind players. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT's concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that's pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New IP rights retained by studio
Developer People Can Fly (Outriders, Bulletstorm) announced that it has had its cooperation agreement terminated by publisher Take-Two Interactive. This motion severely affects the current development plans for People Can Fly's "Project Dagger", a title that has been in production at the developer's New York studio for the past two years.
The news was revealed in People Can Fly's latest financial update, where it is stated that Take-Two, the publisher behind such behemoths as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, had essentially pulled out of the project entirely, leaving Project Dagger with a developer, but no publisher to handle its eventual marketing and release. Take-Two seemingly chose not to purchase the rights to the project, which will be retained by the studio.
Addressing the turbulent situation, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says that he "assumes" the two companies will part on good terms, and expresses the studio's desire to continue development on the title, with an eye to finding a new publisher, or perhaps even self-publishing. Project Dagger, which remains under wraps, had been described previously as a "groundbreaking adventure game", and is currently in the process of transitioning from Unreal 4 to the dazzling new tech of Unreal 5.
"We strongly believe in the Project Dagger's potential and are now committed to continue its development within our self-publishing pipeline," confirms Wojciechowski. "The game is still in pre-production – our team is now focusing on closing combat and game loops and migrate from UE4 to UE5. I'm conscious that this decision will add investments on us, but self-publishing is part of our strategy."
"Of course, we are not ruling out working with a new publisher if this creates a compelling business opportunity."

Where the original offers a more traditional top-down view where you're avoiding cops' attention by dodging cones of vision, Serial Cleaners sprinkles different characters and abilities into the mix, alongside a visual revamp that ups more than just the aesthetics. And it works! Making the act of evidence disposal an action-packed affair that makes it a great game to play in bursts.

The story wasn't complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners debuted on Netflix a few weeks ago, and the Studio Trigger anime is absolutely stellar. And it, alongside several big patches, is likely the reason behind 2077's sudden spike in player count.
Whether you'll find more of Edgerunners in Cyberpunk 2077 is a different topic entirely, as the two are mostly separate stories. You can find some cameos of 2077 characters in Edgerunners, and 2077 has a tie-in quest line and some tidbits for Edgerunners. And obviously, both spring out from the tab…]]></summary>

After years of sitting atop the throne of online streaming services, Netflix has been in somewhat of a decline recently, despite the popularity of shows like Stranger Things. Netflix told us a while ago that it was going to be entering the games space, but now it's doubling down — the company just announced that it will be opening its very own internal games studios to create its own projects.
The studio is set to be established in Helsinki, Finland, which "is home to some of the best game talent in the world," and Marko Lastikka will be serving as the studio director. Netflix is building this new studio "from scratch," and will be its second studio in Helinski along with Next Games. Night School Studio and Boss Fight Entertainment…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little more time to tune in
Over the weekend, Night School Studio confirmed it needs a little extra time for its next Oxenfree entry. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals has been delayed to 2023.
"To make Oxenfree II truly special and add more localizations, we're moving our release window to 2023," said the studio on social media. "Thank you for your patience, support, and understanding, We can't wait to share the game with you. Stay tuned!"
Originally revealed as a stinger in a 2021 Nintendo Indie World Showcase, Oxenfree II has been pushed back a few times. The follow-up to 2016's surprise horror hit Oxenfree seems to need just a little more time to come together.
If you haven't got around to the first Oxenfree though, there is some good news. Netflix subscribers can now play Oxenfree: Netflix Edition on their phones via the Netflix app.

Somewhere further down the dial
While it's a bummer for anyone who's been eagerly awaiting the next slice of Oxenfree, hopefully this makes the work come together for Night School. The original Oxenfree was incredible, and I enjoyed the unique twists and mechanics of Afterparty as well.
Night School itself has been busy, too. The studio was purchased by Netflix roughly a year ago today. This is certainly a studio that can bring some storytelling power to Netflix's gaming selection.
I'm eager to see what's been going on with the island and how Oxenfree II carries on the story five years later. Our preview made it sound like it was coming together, and hopefully a little extra time helps Night School bring it all home.
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is planned for a 2023 launch on PlayStation consoles, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Labour Party head and leader of the UK parliamentary opposition Jeremy Corbyn was spotted engaging in some quality gaming time over the weekend, taking on the Iron Lady in Doom 2 mod Thatcher’s Techbase. The left-winger and lifelong reader of Rail magazine got his thumbs a-twiddlin’ for a special arcade version of the mod while at The World Transformed, a festival being held in Liverpool that celebrates radical politics, art, and culture. This is what he’s doing instead of singing God Save The King at the party conference then.

There hasn’t been an in-person E3 since 2019, and just one digital event bearing the E3 name has taken place since then. That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they're this site’s parent organisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea's Game Rating committee, and it's possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead.

Taki-san's performance as character Kyohei Hamura was removed from the Japanese version of Judgment after he was arrested for possession and use of cocaine in 2019, never making it to the West. Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it's working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig's new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There's also Crystal Dynamic's Marvel's Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year's excellent Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.

But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit "double pumping" strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD's initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC "Genoa" processors.]]></summary>

Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn't mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel "truly special" and to add more localizations. 
Here's the studio's full statement on the delay:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don't usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it's a fun silly idea; 2) it's very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It's a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn't frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Hyper Demon is a game of immense and almost incomprehensible violence, the surprise sequel to Devil Daggers opens in such a lovely way. Before beginning your descent into deicide, you must claim your unholy knife and oh, there it is, surrounded by hopping little crystalline birds! What pretty birds they are! Oh, and they're cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie rhythm game Trombone Champ released on Steam last week, and it deserves a round of applause for its sheer commitment to the brass majesty of the ‘bone. Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it's the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner. If you haven’t already witnessed the game in action then please do yourself a favour and watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever played a game and thought, "Are we actually the bad guys here?" Usually, the whole "we're fighting on the wrong side of history" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, "Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy." It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

        <updated>2022-09-21T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon's Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the games I sampled at this year's Gamescom, Scorn surprised me the most. For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.
Nope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For what is now the fifth time in a row, Valve have announced that waiting Steam Deck reservation holders will get their SteamOS handheld earlier than anticipated. That’s thanks to yet another uptick in production speed, according to a Steam Community post, so everyone whose delivery estimate was in Q3 2022 should now have received their confirmation email. Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won't be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

I feel I wasted this summer a bit and as much as I do like autumn, I really am not ready for the winter which will follow.

Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile

Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …]]></summary>

That's more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you're getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smi…]]></summary>

Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass' free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko's Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they're mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.

Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 delivers breathtaking clarity and a riveting next-gen experience, but will it have the games to make you want it?
When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp. The display resolution is 2000x2040 per eye, and the games can run at smooth framerat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it's called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo's digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack? Maybe you're super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can't talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you're most hyped about coming out of today's Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!]]></summary>
