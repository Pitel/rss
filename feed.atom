        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its release, tons of content has been added to the popular open-world survival crafting title Terraria, including bosses. There are now almost 20 bosses in total in Terraria, with no sort of instruction on which you should fight and when. It's recommended you fight all Terraria bosses in order so you are best prepared for each encounter.

Pre-Hardmode Boss Order


Once you start your adventure in Terraria, your world is in a pre-Hardmode state. In this state, there are six required boss encounters and two optional ones. Here is the recommended Pre-Hardmode boss order in Terraria and how to start them:

Even more so now, in fact, as Noita's just received the massive Epilogue 2 update, upgrading the title further still.


The Epilogue 2 update for Noita is the unexpected new content update for the legendarily reactive rogue-lite side-scroller. Physics-driven and random to a fault, Noita received its "final" Epilogue update back in 2021. The first Epilogue was, in every meaningful way, supposed to wrap Noita up in full and tie it down with a bow on top. Now, years later, we've got the similarly substantial Epilogue 2 content update to show for, and it's a hoot with new spells, fixes, and more - all available for free for …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A pair of updates from EA has revealed that its Motive Studio, which developed the Dead Space remake, will now be contributing to the Battlefield series, and that Battlefield 2042's seventh season of content will be its last.


This is part of a wider plan to build an interconnected universe of Battlefield multiplayer and single-player games. That second detail should excite those who were upset by Battlefield 2042's distinct lack of single-player campaign. Considering Motive is best known for its single-player offerings, specifically the aforementioned Dead Space remake and Star Wars: Squadrons, it's perhaps a perfect choice for developing something single-player for Battlefield.

Regardless of your history with the series, there's no denying the impact that Star Wars has had in the pop culture landscape.

But it was the Original Trilogy that developer Massive Entertainment – the team behind games like The Division, The Division 2, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – chose to make its playground.

What team is the best for Pokémon Go Jungle Cup?


The best team to use for Pokémon Go Jungle Cup are Abomasnow, Clodsire, and Vigoroth. The three Pokémon have proven valuable with the tournament's lineup and have even made their way up the meta. Vigoroth is one of the most used members of the Jungle Cup, where some players have deemed it too OP for the league. However, this works in our favor to blast through the entire competition quickly.

That's why we've put together the best Bruen Mk9 loadout, including attachments, perks, and equipment. 


When it comes to the current Warzone meta, it's hard to look past the Renetti JAK Conversion Kit. No matter how frustrating players may find it, it's the dominant weapon at this point, and will remain so until the developers finally nerf it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive Studio, the EA team behind last year's Dead Space remake and its in-development Iron Man game, has revealed it is forming a new internal team to support the Battlefield franchise. Motive will help develop future Battlefield experiences as it continues to work on its Iron Man game with Marvel, which it says has hit a "major internal milestone." 
This news comes from a new blog post by Motive's general manager, Patrick Klaus, where he also reveals the directors behind the studio's Dead Space remake – executive producer Philippe Ducharme and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola – will build a new team to work alongside EA's Battlefield studios. 


"Their proven expertise in storytelling, immersive battles, and developing on the Frostbite engine uniquely positions them to help advance the vision for Battlefield, led by Vince Zampella (EVP, group general manager for Respawn and Battlefield) and Byron Beede (SVP, general manager for Battlefield). 
"In parallel, development continues to move forward on our Iron Man project, led by Olivier Proulx (executive producer) and Ian Frazier (creative director). The team made excellent progress this year, hitting a major internal milestone and laying a robust foundation for the journey ahead. Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished so far." 
Motive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company's Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, Battlefield 2042, released in 2021. In 2022, we learned the next Battlefield game had entered pre-production with plans to take "valuable lessons" learned from Battlefield 2042 into the game's development.

I do not have telekinetic powers that allow me to control the path of a bullet from a sniper rifle, and I was not part of a murderous cult that killed my father-figure. But if I did and I were, you can bet that I'd go on a rip-roaring rampage of revenge! Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level. It's a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it's neat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Pocketpair has advised Palworld players on Xbox not to load multiplayer save data because of a new issue introduced to the game alongside the v0.2.0.6 update.


Last week, Palworld received its first major content update since its January launch. Aside from adding new items to the survival game, it also introduced a super challenging raid boss in Bellanoir. It was originally only for the PC version, but now Xbox fans can enjoy the new additions.

A couple of hours after the Xbox update went live, though, Pocketpal revealed on X (formerly Twitter) it had become aware of an issue with multiplayer save data not loading properly, specifically multiplayer data from an older version of Palworld. This won't bother anyone who plays Palworld solo, but those who prefer to run the game with friends will undoubtedly be frustrated at not being able to load their saves.


A message in the Palworld Discord channel from community manager Bucky says the team has at least identified the cause of the problem, and is working on a patch that should fix it. However, there's currently no indication of when the patch will come out. Plus, any new multiplayer saves you make now won't work once this new patch releases, so there's basically no point running multiplayer games for the time being.


It's unfortunate that such a long awaited update has brought trouble with it. When it arrived on PC, it introduced a bug that made it impossible to place eggs in incubators, preventing players from hatching new Pals. Pocketpair is still working on a permanent fix for that, but there is at least an easy workaround that almost renders the bug a non-issue. The same sadly can't be said for this Xbox multiplayer bug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Infinite Craft, ash is more than just the remains of items you burn in a fire. Fortunately, while it requires a specific recipe, it's a straightforward item you can make quickly using the four starting elements. Here's how to make ash in Infinite Craft.


How to make Ash in Infinite Craft


Screenshot by Destructoid


To make ash, you'll need to combine wind and Earth to make dust, followed by merging dust with fire. This quick two-step process results in ash, allowing you to unlock it seconds after starting your Infinite Craft playthrough. 


Be careful as you merge your words, as it's easy to accidentally create items like volcano, smoke, or lava if you mix up the combinations. Your goal is to make dust using Earth and wind first before adding fire to the mix. Starting with fire or using water instead can lead to other related words and make you skip ash altogether. 


How to use Ash in Infinite Craft


You're ready to explore new merges once you unlock the word ash. Below are some words to make using your starting elements:



Fire + Ash = Phoenix


Earth + Ash = Soil


Water + Ash = Puddle



From here, you can find additional combinations using ash, previously discovered words, and basic ones you unlock using your four elements. Below are some extra examples:



Dust + Ash = Cinder


Mountain + Ash = Volcano


Volcano + Ash = Lava


Phoenix + Ash = Rebirth


Ash + Ash = Stone



Many more ash combinations exist in Infinite Craft, with the ones above giving you an idea of what to expect. Several items, like love and Venus, will lead back to Phoenix and other fire-related words. However, a few can produce some fun or bizarre results, making it worthwhile to experiment with every element you have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tea Set in Stardew Valley has always been one of the rarest items in the game. It was, until update 1.6, only available as a gift given at the Feast of the Winter Star. If you’ve been after this item for a while, I’ve got good news. But I’ve also got bad news. 


The Tea Set, at first glance, doesn’t seem like it would be such an elusive item. The much wanted gift can be given by almost all of the adult villagers (except Clint, Emily, Marnie, Robin and Willy) at the Feast of the Winter Star. However, the chances of getting this specific item are incredibly low. People have even gone as far as to test timing theories, which seems to offer some increased chance. 


However, there is hope. The issue is, this hope is at the end of a very, very long tunnel. At least if you want to go down the ‘proper’ route. 


How to get the Tea Set in Stardew Valley 1.6

With the 1.6 update, ConcernedApe threw us a bone and put in one additional way to get the Tea Set in Stardew Valley. Unfortunately, it’s still very much up to chance. 


This new method for getting the Tea Set requires you to wait until year 25. Yes, you read that right—year 25. 


Once you reach year 25, there is a 5% chance that the Traveling Cart will have a Tea Set in stock at any given time. If the Tea Set is listed for purchase, you’ll need 1,000,000 Gold in order to purchase it. 


How to guarantee a Tea Set in Stardew Valley

If you’re sick of waiting, or don’t want to leave things to chance, there is one guaranteed way to get a Tea Set in Stardew Valley. I don’t recommend this method, as it’s basically cheating, but there is a way. 


To do it, head down to Marnie’s and purchase any animal, putting [341] as their name. Once you leave the shop interface, you’ll have a Tea Set in your inventory, but you’ll forever have to live with the guilt of knowing how you got it.

The story trailer is currently scheduled to air today on April 9 at 9am PT / 12pm EDT / 5pm BST across Ubisoft's YouTube channels. However, the Ubisoft Japan channel appeared to have accidentally included Star Wars: Outlaws' release date in the video description: August 30.




The video has since been set to private, but Gematsu caught wind of it beforehand and saved a screenshot of the description for posterity's sake. Not only did it mention the release date, but it also revealed there will be two special editions—a Gold Edition and an Ultimate Edition—which come with a season pass (which confirms post-launch DLC) and three…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the massive improvements released as part of Update 6, Forza Motorsport's Update 7 isn't quite as monumental as that, but it's a big deal nonetheless. The highlights are the Brands Hatch track and a huge reduction of the game's installation footprint, cutting it down by a whopping 25 GB.


Forza Motorsport released in a questionable state in October 2023, and it wasn't until early 2024 that the developer Turn 10 came up with a plan to resolve the game's many, many problems. Now, with Update 7 rocking about, Forza Motorsport is indeed in a much healthier - albeit not perfect - state. The new update's unquestionable headliner is Brands Hatch, one of the most iconic European sporting venues of all time.

Publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment and developers LEAP Game Studios and Tiny Ghoul have today announced that the monster-collecting, deck-building roguelike Dicefolk will be rolling onto Switch later this year.
There's a dash of Pokémon in Dicefolk's creature catching, sure, but the combat system is far from anything that you would see Pikachu and co. pull off. As the name suggests, dice play a big part in this one, with your moves all being decided by what you roll. The added tactical layer comes from your ability to control both teams, so you'll have to think ahead to get the best match-up possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ermac is the next fighter to join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster, and developer NetherRealm Studios has released a new gameplay trailer showcasing what players can expect of the shadowy warrior. The trailer also reveals Ermac hits Early Access on April 16 before his full release on April 23, and that Mavado will join the Kameo roster later next month. 
"Ermac is a collection of souls bound together by Quan Chi's dark magic that are intended to function as a group mind," a press release reads. "But that spell is temporarily undone when Ermac is defeated by Mileena and the mind of King Jerrod, deceased ruler of Outworld and one of the souls in Ermac's collection, takes control and rejoins the royal family, aiding Empress Mileena's reign. 
"Eventually, the amalgam of souls re-establishes control, and Ermac retreats to Outworld's shadows. No longer Quan Chi's slave, nor bound to the royal family, he must find a future worth fighting for."
Check out Ermac in the Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay trailer below: 


To get Ermac, purchase the Premium Edition of Mortal Kombat 1 or buy the Kombat Pack for your Standard Edition of the game. The Kombat Pack indudes a Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now) and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (coming April 16), Homelander, and Takeda Takahashi. The Kombat Pack includes all five DLC Kameo fighters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wildly successful Helldivers 2 keeps bringing in one live narrative twist after another. Notably, even though Super Earth celebrated the total defeat of the game's Automaton faction, the celebrations appear to have been premature. Indeed, the Automatons are back, and they're back with a vengeance.


As announced on the game's official Discord and Twitter, Automatons made a grand return onto the galactic stage just moments ago. Super Earth claims this was "suspected all along," naturally, but the scale of the bots' return is quite unprecedented. The Automatons' new, freshened-up fleet is tens of thousands of warships strong, and it's begun its massive onslaught at the Valdis Sector, seemingly gunning it yet once more toward Cyberstan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, we're all aware of the current state of the video game industry. Redundancies and studio closures have become all too common this past year or so, and the bad news just keeps coming. It seems as though the UK retail giant GAME is making staff aware of potential layoffs going forward.


According to a recent report from Eurogamer, staff have contacted the website anonymously to say they've been told to expect redundancies. No official word about this has come to light at the time of writing, but it's been said that most workers are being moved over to zero-hours contracts, which doesn't guarantee them a specific number of hours each week/month.

This goes for non-managerial staff, and staff have said the company will get in touch via phone or email to let them know about job statuses. Eurogamer has contacted GAME for comment.


Surprised it's taken this long


At one point, the bricks-and-mortar business was the go-to for a lot of gamers in the UK. It's been in operation since 1992, with more than 250 outlets across the country.


However, with the shift towards digital gaming, the likes of GAME are struggling to keep afloat in the modern era. In 2019, the company was bought out by Frasers Group, a British retail giant originally operating under the Sports Direct International brand. It was also announced earlier this year that the company would cease its popular trade-in service.


Having been a past employee of GAME, it feels like the last bastion of physical gaming retail stores is about to take its final bow. It's not certain what's going to happen to the brand, but the staff will be the ones affected most by the changes. Currently, there's no information on exactly how many jobs could be cut if layoffs do go ahead.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Alana is talking about a Vanillaware oldie — Muramasa: The Demon Blade, a Wii title that is celebrating its 15th anniversary. And, in the wake of 13 Sentinels and Unicorn Overlord's success, it's time to give Vanillaware's older title some love.

Vanillaware has been pretty much everywhere. It's visited magical, mystical storybook worlds in Odin Sphere. It's returned to a medieval, warfaring world many times with Grand Knights History and Unicorn Overlord. It's been to 1980s Japan in 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. We've even been able to go to witch school thanks to GrimGrimoire. But despite the wide variety of softly painted and gorgeous worlds, I always find myself looking back to Edo Japan the fondest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March 2023, Dredge became one of the most talked-about games of the year thanks to its combination of engaging fishing mechanics, an enthralling atmosphere, and a fun story involving sinister secrets buried at sea. Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.
In the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, "Think The Sixth Sense on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway."
"We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe," a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.
Story Kitchen was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. "Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning," a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.
Dredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic. If you missed it, it is currently available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Part of the thrill of horror gaming is testing your own mettle in an isolated setting, shut off from the comfort of group banter. Expect paranoia.


To that end, Kinetic Games' ghost-hunting title does allow for solo play, which makes for a somewhat more intense experience overall. It is, of course, entirely possible to complete an investigation without help from others. 


However, it can be a little more trying without adequate backup, so I'm throwing a few tips your way. These should allow you to be more prepared when deciding to play sans friends. And as the old saying goes: in Phasmophobia, no one can hear your frightened whimpers.

"Somehow, the Automatons returned. As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet how now begun an assault on Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. 
Walton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. 
If you haven't yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's big Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover is finally here, adding the entire Gaang to the battle royale... except for Sokka.


For context, the v29.20 patch for Fortnite includes skins for Katara, Toph, and Zuko, with Aang getting two skins as part of his own battle pass. Sokka, however, is completely absent despite being one of The Last Airbender's main characters. He debuted in the very first episode and became one of Aang's travelling companions long before Toph and Zuko joined them, yet he's nowhere to be seen in Fortnite. Not even his iconic boomerang made it in, though you can use his cool meteorite sword as a pickaxe.


Admittedly, there is something oddly fitting about Sokka not making it into Fortnite. He was typically the butt of jokes and was often overshadowed by his …]]></summary>

Destructible terrain is the most noteworthy inclusion since it opens up new strategies. One example publisher Krafton has given is making trenches you can use to avoid enemy fire. You can alter the terrain with some throwable items, like the Frag Grenade, and vehicle explosions, but also a new pickaxe weapon, which I'm sure will elicit some Fortnite comparisons. Any terrain made from concrete, cement, rock, or stone, though, can't be destroyed, so you can't go ham and blow everything up.




These new additions are also exclusive to the Rondo map, which was recently added to PUBG: Battlegrounds this past December. The 2024 roadmap Kraft…]]></summary>

When you boot up the game after the Fortnite v29.20 update, you'll see Zuko, Katara, and Toph all available to purchase in the game's Item Shop. Aang, the Avatar and main character of The Last Airbender, however, is nowhere to be seen, leaving fans who hoped to play as him disappointed. 


Don't fear though, as he is coming to the battle royale, and we've got all the details.

When is Aang's skin coming to Fortnite?


Aang is scheduled to arrive in Fortnite on Friday, April 12, 2024. He won't be added to the Item Shop, however, as he will receive his own mini Battle Pass, aptly titled the Elements Pass.


How to unlock Aang skin in Fortnite


To unlock the skin, Avatar: The Last Airbender fans will need to purchase the Elements Pass, and then rank it up to eventually unlock the skins. This can be done by playing matches or completing challenges to earn XP rewards. 


What's included in Fortnite's Elements Pass?


There are nine items included in Fortnite's Avatar: The Last Airbender Elements Pass:



Two Aang Skins with LEGO Fortnite versions


Aang Spray


Aang Banner


Aang Airbender emote


Momo Back Bling


Aang emoticon


Aang's Staff Harvesting Tool



There's plenty to unlock. Image via Epic Games


We'll know more about the XP requirements when the Elements Pass goes live this Friday, and we'll be sure to update this article once we have all the details.

That's plenty of time to get accustomed to Sea of Thieves' gameplay loop and mechanics. The downside is this isn't a 'try before you buy' situation. According to developer Rare, the only way to gain access to the beta is by pre-ordering Sea of Thieves on PS5.




This may be deflating for anyone still on the fence about checking Sea of Thieves out, especially with it no longer being an Xbox/PC exclusive. It may be a live service, but Sea of Thieves is…]]></summary>

Staff at UK retailer GAME are reportedly facing redundancies as the firm moves most of its workforce under zero hour contracts.
As reported by Eurogamer, it's not currently known how many employees will be laid off, but it's understood that all non-managerial staff will now be on zero hour contracts going forwards. For those who might not be familiar with the UK scheme, zero hour contracts offer up no guarantee of work for the employee, as the employer is not under any obligation to set a minimum number of working hours.

Best way to get Cloutium


In order to get Cloutium in Hydroneer: Journey to Volcalidus, you need to dig in the Tier 2 area of ice at a mining site. The starting site, Dawn Rest, is not deep enough to reach Tier 2. However, all of the other mining sites in the DLC go down to Tier 3, so you will have no problem finding Cloutium.

Which aim assist type is the best in MW3 and Warzone?


Black Ops or Default are the best aim assist types in MW3 and Warzone. Both specs offer the traditional aim slowdown from past games, making it easier to shoot enemies. If you're a BO player, then the Black Ops aim assist type is the obvious choice. On the other hand, Modern Warfare lovers should lean toward the Default, as it uses this series' mechanics.

We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.
Notably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout, Amazon Prime’s TV adaptation of Bethesda’s popular RPG, is set to premiere this week on April 11. However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. 
Variety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list
Season 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.


Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads

San Diego Studio returns for a third season of baseball action on Nintendo Switch and it's another fairly solid job all round for 2024, giving fans yet another feature-complete port that manages to get the most important stuff right during its deep and addictive matches.
Indeed, whilst MLB The Show 24 has seen plenty of technical issues at launch — which we'll get into — and there's not much new or exciting here over what you'll find in the previous two outings, there's no denying that this is probably about as good as we can realistically expect these sorts of enormous sports games to run on Switch at this point. It works, but you can almost hear the seams popping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s odd to think back on a time before Baldur’s Gate 3 - and even stranger to think that the sprawling Dungeons & Dragons RPG was actually kicking around for a long while before its 1.0 release blew up awards shows, social media feeds and fan-fiction hubs last summer. Putting the game out into early access at the end of 2020 - multiple years before it was ready for a full release - worked out very well for Larian though, so it’s maybe no surprise that they plan to do exactly the same with whatever comes next.

Having beat them myself, I didn't find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was "Elder Scrolls with friends," creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch "we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game'," Lambert says. "We didn't do either of them particularly well."
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating "a lot of feedback", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. "We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since." Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomin' lovely.
When cosy and wholesome games first stepped onto the scene, they were counter-culture — created in response and in resistance to an industry that churned out violence, conflict, and a particular type of masculinity that wasn't keen on things like emotions or intimacy. Some people were tired of this monolithic and exclusionary idea of what a game 'should' be — and so, as a direct contrast to all of that, the cosy game movement was created, prioritising stories that minimised conflict, and focused instead on growth and creation. That's part of the reason why so many cosy games are about farming and relationships, because the themes of cultivation and creation are almost the exact opposite of violence and conflict.
But these days, cosy games have become a dominant part of gaming culture, and the conflict-free alternatives they once offered as a respite from the status quo are now a lucrative part of the status quo. This is what happens when counter-culture becomes culture: it forgets its roots and its purpose, and instead becomes about aping what's already popular. In the process, many cosy games fail to understand that a player's desire for softness and kindness does not mean that they want a completely toothless game. Challenge is not conflict. Challenge is fun.

It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, "overambitious" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Microsoft is currently in the process of rolling out select Xbox exclusive on the Switch and PlayStation 5, and apparently, one particular upcoming title could decide if it releases more games on these platforms in the future.
The Verge's senior editor Tom Warren claims the PlayStation 5 release Sea of Thieves, arriving on 30th April 2024, will be a "key test for whether other games might make their way to the PS5 or Nintendo Switch". Sea of Thieves is set to follow the release of Grounded on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch on 16th April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

The most recent defendant, a 48-year-old man from East Jutland, pleaded guilty to his involvement in the Asgaard tracker and was handed a conditional prison sentence. According to local anti-piracy group Rights Alliance, the punishment should have been much tougher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment has revealed that a new Star Wars Outlaws story trailer will be released next week. We'll be seeing more of protagonist Kay Vess and her trusty (and adorably cute) companion Nix on Tuesday, April 9, at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
As for what to expect, Ubisoft hasn't shared anything in that regard. It simply says the story trailer is arriving next week and that it will be published on YouTube. 
Watch the World Premiere of the Star Wars Outlaws Story Trailer. Join us at 9AM PST / 6PM CET.
April 5, 2024
This story trailer is our next taste of Star Wars Outlaws, an open-world adventure set between Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It was announced during an Xbox Games Showcase last June and further showcased with gameplay at a Ubisoft Forward the same month. You can read more about the game in our preview of it here, and you can read this exclusive interview with the game's narrative director about what to expect. 
Star Wars Outlaws is due out sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Martin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fulqrum Publishing have just released a story trailer for New Arc Line, a new steampunk fantasy RPG in which dragons rub shoulders with zeppelins, and dwarves are as abundant as air pollution. I hadn't heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it's a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive "shining city of progress", rather than the typical Chosen One fare.
Your family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to "get your hands dirty", "rise from the bottom" and become some sort of absolute bastard. Take us away, trailer!

On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?
He has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this. Do you hear me, lubbers? I will show my strategy game mastery by conquering Total War: Warhammer 3’s world, and I will never touch grass.

Although faux-medieval games are common, there aren't all that many about regular people and regular concerns. Even LotR was increasingly about battles and armies as it went on, rather than the unique management parts.
But in Under The Yoke, you're just a serf. You want to make something of yourself, but it's about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely "adventurer", whatever that means. So you'll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it's weirdly compelling.

Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.


"Who are you calling a Wanzer?" you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a handheld PC, the Steam Deck benefits an awful lot from having a mouse and keyboard plugged into it, and nothing enables this marriage of portable and peripheral like one of the best Steam Deck docks. And it’s not just USB connectivity that gets a boost – external displays, rock-solid Ethernet connections for game downloads, and power delivery all make dock usage a preferable alternative to simply hooking up Bluetooth accessories. Along with a microSD card (and possibly a better case), these stand/hub combos are definitely among the tools that any regular Steam Deck wielder should have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Front Mission 2: Remake is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this month. More specifically, the previously Switch-exclusive remake will hit these new platforms on April 30. 
Released back in October on Switch, Front Mission 2: Remake is the first time Western players have been able to play through this tactics/strategy RPG since the game's original Japan-only release in 1997. It's set 12 years after Front Mission 1st: Remake, which hit Switch in November 2022 and other platforms in June of last year, and puts players in control of Ash, an O.C.U soldier trying to escape the overrun nation of Alordesh. However, in this escape, Ash learns of a much broader conspiracy. 
Check out the Front Mission 2: Remake release date trailer for yourself below: 


Like the Switch version, Front Mission 2: Remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC features improved loading times compared to the original, free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new customization options, and extra language support. 
Starting April 15, PC players can check out a free demo of Front Mission 2: Remake on Steam. Developer and publisher Forever Entertainment says saved game data from the demo will carry over to the full game upon its release later this month. 
Front Mission 2: Remake hit Switch back in October; it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on April 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.
I spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.

This means that when they launch new stuff for Seasons Of Discovery it'll probably break more often, but it means players get to discover brand new things together. Which is great!

Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.
The change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goblin Stone released almost a month ago, but we haven't written about it yet, and it feels like you should know about it. It's a turn-based RPG, it's a roguelike with permadeath, it's got XCOM-style base-building, its got card-based combat; it is extremely your sort of thing, if you're the exact statistical average of Rock Paper Shotgun readers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Roblox Studios have responded to Eurogamer's report, in particular addressing the quote that they "hired some teenagers" to clarify that they do not hire minors. You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.
Original story
Roblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.

"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. "Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.

This swashbuckling debut from Savage Level is due out in Q4 of this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and if today's debut trailer is any indication, it looks like a game worth keeping a spyglass on. 
Savage Level describes Flint as a double-A game that takes inspiration from one of piracy's most famed fictional stories: Treasure Island.
"Prepare to weigh anchor alongside Captain Flint, his trusty first mate Billy Bones, and their crew of seasoned sea dogs as they set sail in search of a legendary treasure promisin' freedom and fortune," a press release reads.

        <updated>2024-04-04T17:50:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung Tae has announced that developer ShiftUp's upcoming action game, Stellar Blade, will get a New Game+ mode sometime after launch. Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. 
This news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. 


"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package," Tae told Ruliweb. "The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon." 
Given that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. 
Stellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not much of a reality TV watcher. Genuinely, I've been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain "colleagues" whose names rhyme with "Malice Knell" making references I don't understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don't need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.


"'Reality' stuff is huge now, and it's not just reality TV," says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. "It's any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media. It's one of those topics that we don't talk about in an explicit way, necessarily, but it's something that you hopefully think about as you're playing the game."

Especially not the one you get with the 1TB Steam Deck OLED, which adds a neat mini-case in the form of a removable liner. Still! As you’ll see here, you do have a choice of worthwhile upgrade options, ranging from conventional hard cases with extra accessory storage to clever protective sleeves that combine impact resistance with improved handheld grip. The best way to avoid Steam Deck damage is to not drop it in the first place, as Sun Tzu probably said.

Dubbed v0.2.0.6, the Steam version of this update for PC players is already live; the Xbox version will be released when it's ready, according to Pocketpair. 
As for what to expect, today's update is one of Palworld's biggest. But chief among the additions is the game's first raid boss, a heavily anticipated aspect of the survival game's endgame. Let's break it all down:

This time, it's leaning into crime, jaunting across the galaxy to resurrect a game of legendary outlaws, the Wild Bastards. Allow me to repeat that name: the Wild Bastards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uniqlo stores currently offer Capcom-inspired clothes that feature the likes of Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil 4, and more, alongside other items of apparel inspired by Konami's Metal Gear Solid series. Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.
The clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. As for when exactly to expect these shirts to hit the states, though, that remains unknown. 
The Tears of the Kingdom line consists of six shirts, and you can check each out in the gallery below: 

On the Japanese website for Uniqlo, each of these shirts is listed for 1,500 Yen, which converts to less than $10 a shirt. However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh new batch of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II previews have dropped today, which is how we learned Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade director-writer Anteem Antoniades is no longer at the studio. It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. 
Speaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. 


Regardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because "the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing." Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

It was the afternoon of day four at GDC, my adrenaline reserves were spent, and there I was, in a warm, shuttered hotel room, with two men gently bombarding me with French-accented details of synergies, stackable trinkets and i-frames (I'm aware that the scenario I've just described is probably somebody's kink - let's move swiftly on).


Windblown itself is an airy, bright fusillade of Saturday morning cartoon vibes, a series of breakneck arena fights waged on procedurally generated island chains floating against a whirlpool sky. It's all shaping up very nicely, and if I'd been playing the demo, I'm sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee. But watching somebody else tear through this stratospheric world simply overloaded my depleted senses, and I came perilously close to nodding off.

This news comes from a new Polygon preview of Ninja Theory's upcoming release, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, which hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Polygon noticed during a hands-on preview of Hellblade II at Ninja Theory's Cambridge, U.K.-based studio that there was no trace of Antoniades. A spokesperson for Xbox confirmed later that Antoniades was no longer working at Ninja Theory.


"On my visit, there was no sign or mention of Ninja Theory's flamboyant founder and Hellblade writer-director Tameem Antoniades," Polygon writes in its Hellblade II preview. "An Xbox spokesperson later confirmed to Polygon that he is no longer with the studio. Antoniades was involved in Hellblade 2 in the early stages, but the game now has a trio of creative leads: environment art director Dan Attwell, visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill, and audio director David Garcia." 
Beyond the Hellblade series, Antoniades also worked on Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry.

When people complain about something being 'tropey' I think often what they're complaining about is that the work isn't putting any kind of interesting spin on the tropes. Great God Grove is a weirdo puzzle game where you have to stop the world from ending, and the only way you can communicate is by sucking up things people say to you and then firing them back out of your news cannon. It's coming to PC in 2024. Jolly good.

But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. 
We got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair have released a new Palworld update, Steam version v0.2.0.6, which introduces the monster-catching survival game's first Raid Boss, a gloating Gothy squid-lady by the name of Bellanoir. She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the "extreme" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.


This is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, "We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC." The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately "there is no controller support at this time"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, "The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time."
Beta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: "For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta."

While Ubisoft Forward and Summer Game Fest aren't technically connected, they typically take place during the same time frame in LA, and this year is no different. With Summer Game Fest's livestream set for June 7, with the invite-only media and influencer event for hands-on gameplay with upcoming games set for June 8 through June 10, it seems press, influencers, and fans will cap off the summer's gaming streams with Ubisoft Forward.

However, with a slew of upcoming and in-development games like Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin's Creed Codename Red, Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe, XDefiant, and The Division Heartland, there's plenty we might see at this year's Ubisoft Forward event. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read about the reveal of Assassin's Creed Codename Red and Codename Hexe, and then check out the gameplay debut of Star Wars Outlaws. After that, check out our hands-on gameplay with XDefiant, and then watch the latest trailer for The Division Heartland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE's Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here's the 1.0 trailer.

Many Stories, and it's a love letter to one of the best parts of Japan: convenience stores. No seriously, Japan's convenience stores, whether it's a local mom 'n pop place, Lawson's (best chicken), Family Mart (best desserts), or 7-Eleven (best egg salad sandos), entering one of these is a treat. 
As someone who just got back from a vacation in Japan, I'm heavily missing these stores, conveniently located everywhere throughout major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and elsewhere. Perhaps that's why InKonbini's reveal trailer has me so excited to play this team's first game; but the game itself looks great, too.

With its final set of DLC coming in The Rising Tide launching this spring, and the PC release on the horizon, developer Creative Business Unit III has brought protagonist Clive Rosfield over to its other Final Fantasy game, the critically acclaimed MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
Thanks to a new crossover event between FFXIV and FFXVI, players can now make their Warrior of Light look like Clive and even ride atop his trusty dog companion, Torgal. Plus, the crossover contains a new story questline for FFXIV, orchestration rolls to collect that feature songs from FFXVI, and an adorable puppy Torgal minion.

Any conversation about great roguelites is incomplete without mentioning Dead Cells, the Castlevania-inspired game from developer Motion Twin. With its variety of biomes, massive armory of unlockable weapons, and breakneck combat, it's cemented itself as one of the best roguelites of all time. But after seven years of support, its development team is moving onto a new project that has the potential to be just as exciting: Windblown, an isometric roguelite with bright graphics and three-player co-op.

Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don't especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I'm still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral "SpookTube" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of "cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation" and "cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

Now, Episode 4 is out for viewing on Disney Plus, and it's clear what the team behind the series was alluding to: The 1992 Konami-developed beat 'em up arcade cabinet game, X-Men. 
We won't spoil the episode here, but in the teaser clip released yesterday, we see Jubilee and Roberto taking on Sentinel enemies in clear sidescroller beat 'em up fashion, and it looks awesome. Check it out for yourself below: 


If you enjoyed this clip, catching up on X-Men '97 is easy as there are only four episodes out so far. And even if you're not interested in this series, today's new episode is worth watching if you've ever gone hands-on with Konami's classic X-Men arcade cabinet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is "alive and well," according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. 
Last month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. 


Now, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. 
"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," Karch told the publication. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations." 
That's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. 
For more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays. After that, check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

Credit to Arma developer's Bohemia Interactive, however. Their April 1st announcement was that the latest update for Arma Reforger was Tiny Wars, a game mode in which you controlled tiny toy Army Men as they waged war around a proportionally huge home. As ever, this isn't really a joke, but it also wasn't exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.
Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast travel is an extremely common and welcome quality of life improvement in modern open-world games, but it's a mechanic Dragon's Dogma 2 heavily deemphasizes. It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it's made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.
It's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere. The other fast-travel option is an expensive item called a ferrystone, whi…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-04-02T18:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.
In a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. 
"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience," says Gearbox as part of its statement. "The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games."
While Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  
Embracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal.

Eternal Strands centers on Brynn, a warrior known as a Weaver searching for secrets of the formerly mighty nation called the Enclave. The game’s system centers around using the world, namely elements and temperature, to your advantage. Brynn wields a magical cloak called the Mantle, which grants her power to manipulate the elements by channeling magic. A reactive world means she can explore by harnessing weather events such as a flash freeze to augment ice abilities and create bridges to open new paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.
It's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.

Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.
Viking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.
Alongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internet provider Frontier Communications asked a New York bankruptcy court to dismiss several piracy liability claims brought by movie and music industry companies. Citing a recent Supreme Court decision, the ISP argued that merely providing Internet service shouldn't invoke liability. The court agreed that liability isn't automatic but it denied the ISP's request, ruling that there are other copyright-specific factors at play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s usually better when writing about games to defer to personal experience before regurgitating marketing, but in the case of bizarre and deeply intriguing 90’s FPS PO’ed, the trailer that STAR WARS: Dark Forces Remaster studio Nightdive released over the long weekend contains a quote that sums up my memories perfectly: “First game I ever owned and played on my PS1,” says quote-ee matt.baller, “In hindsight, I’m surprised I’m not more messed up.”
PO’ed, in which you play a Pissed Off space chef crash-landed on an alien world, was not the very first game I owned for my PS1, but it was certainly one of, and it left a very strong impression. Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens. If you’re as lost as I imagine anyone hearing of this for the first time might rightly be, here’s that trailer.

It's another mercifully brief four day week in the UK due to reasons of religion, so let's roll with an appropriately snappy intro that avoids any extended digressionary preambles about, oh, I don't know, magpies fighting outside my flat this morning. Did you know that European magpies are great mimics? Second only to the Northern Mockingbird, apparently, though many ornithologists contend that the Brown Thrasher is sorely overlooked. You certainly hear their vocal range when they squabble - I reckon somebody should train up a ChatGPT AI on their calls and no, stop it, I'm doing an anecdote!
Those new PC game releases, without any further ado about birds: Minish Cap-esque shmup Minishoot Adventures (2nd April); Cuban fantasy metroidvania Saviorless (2nd April); culinary defence game Kitchen Crisis (3rd April); Dorfromantikal world builder Planetiles (3rd April); rhythmic robo-dystopian roguelike Beat Slayer (4th April); 90s biker's delight BMX Streets (5th April).

It has a fascinating and unique style set in a well-realized future where a portion of humanity has relocated to an underwater planet. It's a bit like Interstellar, but if things had gone how they were supposed to. Ahead of the game's release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers' intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.
For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A study on emerging public perceptions of intellectual property in UK media has found that there are "pronounced inaccuracies in the reporting on IP related matters in the UK Press." An initial review published by the UK's Intellectual Property Office notes that inaccurate reporting may be due to a "lack of understanding." Further investigation would be required to find out the "cause and extent" and the subsequent impact on IP rights as understood by the public.

CD Projekt Red are no stranger to releasing buggy games, but they're less keen on microtransactions - at least for singleplayer games. In an interview with a Polish investor site, CDPR's chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said that they "do not see a place for microtransactions in the case of singleplayer games", but they wouldn't rule it out for multiplayer.

This isn't because the Quest 1 isn't powerful enough to play them anymore, but because developers will no longer be able to upload them and players won't be able to see them. 

It's part of the planned obsolescence of the Quest 1 which Meta announced last year.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we took the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue.

With over a decade of work already invested in the fan project, however, the team have now released a call for help to overcome development hurdles caused by the ongoing troubled state of the games industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.
Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. 


The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. 
Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.]]></summary>

This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. 
This move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…]]></summary>
