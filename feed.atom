Sega has had so much success with the Sonic the Hedgehog movies that it has already locked in the third one and confirmed a separate television series starring Knuckles. If this wasn't enough, it's now officially confirmed there'll be Space Channel 5 and Comix Zone adaptations.

"SEGA is partnering with @picturestart to produce film adaptions of Space Channel 5 and Comix Zone!"

Plus, if you stick to the very end, you'll still get to see a new horrible monster.

"Well Cuphead and his pal Mugman, they like to roll the dice..."
If you're feeling nostalgic for the original Cuphead title screen, there's now a way to go back — a recent patch added a sneaky toggle, allowing Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course players to swap between the newer Ms. Chalice opener and the duo's classic tune.
To change the title screen music, go to the Options menu in Cuphead and look for a newly-added title screen setting in the Visuals section.

Both songs are great in their own way, but I have a soft spot for the original quartet vibe.
Patch 1.3.4 also cleans up minor issues
After seeing a notification, I was curious what was patched — that's the main inclusion.
That said, Studio MDHR also cleaned up some outstanding issues:
Fixed rare issue with Boatman dialogue being triggered after fast traveling.
Added ability to undo wishes.
Fixed localization issues.
Fixed minor animation issues.
Fixed minor audio issues.
Every so often, I see people post about glitches on Reddit, so they're out there. Aside from one or two animation hiccups (that never showed up again), I've been lucky so far.
Cuphead is one of those games I wish I could zap from my (admittedly feeble) memory so that I could go through it again, all fresh and ready for punishment.

Something very different from the old-school players at Hamster this week, as Namco's strange, science-fiction runner Metro-Cross joins the Arcade Archives — available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1985, before receiving ports to a wide variety of home computers, Metro-Cross is a fast-paced, side-scrolling runner, predating popular such as Temple Run and Canabalt by a good few decades. Players guide a jumpsuited protagonist as they sprint down a hi-tech corridor laden with traps, hazards, and obstacles. The crazy sprinting action is automatic and unstoppable, with the player tasked with keeping our star from coming a cropper at the myriad objects that lay strewn in their path.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyTHqUgqu3k
In a crazy headlong dash against the clock, The Runner must dodge and/or leap over the obstacles, while picking up drinks to maintain their stamina and even boarding a handy skateboard in order to increase their momentum. Like so many fast scrolling titles of the day, Metro-Cross is a little dizzying, not helped by the game's checkerboard pattern, but it's an amusing oddity, and as such it's neat to see it added to Hamster's ever-growing collection of games that time forgot. A sequel, Aero-Cross, was being developed in the late-'00s for release on Xbox Live Arcade, but the game was ultimately canceled.
Metro-Cross is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You ever think about how short cats are?
Nothing makes a game feel fresh like looking at it from a different perspective. I'm not just being philosophical here — someone modded Stray so you can play the game in first-person. Personally, that might make me a bit motion sick with all the jumping and such, but if you're looking to replay and switch up your Stray experience, this mod might be the perfect fit.
Aptly named Stray - First Person Mod, it allows you to see the game as if you were the cat himself (or herself? I don't think I ever figured out what gender the cat is supposed to be in the game). The mod was created by a user named Jessica Natalia, and you can download it over on NexusMods (via The Gamer).
I could definitely see how the first-person perspective would make the experience more immersive, but it's better saved for at least a second playthrough considering many of the puzzles are better suited to a third-person view. Just based on the demo video of the Stray mod, though, it is pretty cool to see the world through a cat's eyes in a game that was designed for you to see the world from a cat's perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU2r1xwBZD0
As can be common with mods, there are a few bugs to be aware of with this one.
Nothing game-breaking, but the cat can become visible if you move quickly, or when walking too close to a wall which makes the camera pop out of place — this happens because the modder moved the placement of where the camera is situated to be where the cat's head is, rather than removing the cat's character model altogether.
Of all the games I've seen get first-person mods, I think it probably makes the most sense in Stray considering perspective is part of the game's narrative themes.
Now I'm just waiting for the Stray VR mod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't let maps and bars get in the way of your perfect shot
I've been slowly whiling away the hours over the last few weeks with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a fun and incredibly scenic RPG. And this week, I picked up a little trick that I wish I had known about from the get-go: a shortcut for easy, HUD-less Xenoblade screenshots.
In most games, I tend to be a screenshot fiend. Part of that is, well, part of the job; if I know I'm going to want to write about something later, having a bevy of good screenshots is useful. But I also like to catalogue my journey, remembering specific moments, lines, and vistas from throughout my time there.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has some good camera options, including one that lets you essentially go full-on first-person mode. But Nintendo of Europe tweeted out this handy tip that changed my Xenoblade screenshot life for the better. If you press the L and R buttons simultaneously, you can easily snap a screenshot without the heads-up display.
https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1559132800028233729
After seeing this, I went directly into my game and started trying it. And indeed, it's basically a macro. The game dips out the HUD, snaps a screenshot, and re-ups the display. It's startling how well this works in real-time; I was a little worried I'd have to give it a bit of lead time, but no, it happens pretty darn fast.
A photo album of adventure
Now I've been revisiting all the places I blew through in my early hours of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 to get new screenshots. Capturing some of the massive landscapes, beautiful views, and colossal sights makes for a fun diversion from the main plot.
It helps that Xenoblade Chronicles 3, on top of being quite a good game, is also a very scenic game. It feels like Monolith Soft ekes incredible views out of the Nintendo Switch, and now, I've got a great tool for preserving them without too much fuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. 
Desiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. 
Sporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry.

Are you riding the waves this weekend? Wave Race 64 is out now on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service, so we're sure some of you are grabbing that late '90s nostalgia. Otherwise, you might be tee-ing up for a round of golf with the well-reviewing Cursed to Golf (we'll have our own review in the future!). Or perhaps you're eyeing up that confirmed finalised list of Mega Drive Mini 2 games.
Elsewhere on Nintendo Life, we've got a list of all the Wii U and 3DS DLC you should grab before the stores close. We also scoffed down Kirby's Dream Buffet in our review. And we also joined the Cult of the Lamb in yet another positive review for this indie hit.

The design still includes the extra buttons on the back as well, allowing players to reassign buttons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new movie could be just around the Bend
It looks like another silver screen Sony adaptation could be on the way. Deadline reports that Sony is currently working on a movie rendition of Days Gone, its post-apocalyptic zombie game with bikers.
According to Deadline, Sam Heughan (Outlander) is "circling" the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner is adapting. Turner and Jennifer Klein are reportedly set to produce, along with Sony PlayStation Productions.
In case you've forgotten, Days Gone is Sony Bend's biker-zombie action game. Released in 2019, Days Gone was like a mixture of The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy, following Deacon "Deke" St. John as he tries to survive in a zombie-infested Pacific Northwest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Ztt2bXI64
Deadline reports that it's heard Turner's script will be a "love ballad to motorcycle movies." Which, well, lines up with Days Gone for sure.
Video game theater
If plans go through, this will mark another in a growing catalogue of Sony's video game adaptations. Uncharted pulled in some solid numbers, even if the reception seems mixed. And HBO's The Last of Us is on the horizon, turning Joel and Ellie's cross-continental adventure into a miniseries that hopefully won't be disrupted by whatever the heck is going on over there right now.
Of the many Sony properties still around, Days Gone certainly seems like it could draw in a more mainstream movie-going audience. It's got bikers, zombies, and grit. You could probably have some pretty sick action sequences with massive "Freaker" hordes and revving motorcycles.
We'll have to see if this particular Sony production ends up moving forward or not. There are a few others, like the Twisted Metal adaptation, that are also in the works. Plus, the Ghost of Tsushima film, the Horizon series at Netflix, and projects for Gran Turismo and God of War. Sony's screen adaptations have only just begun, it seems.

Pre-load for the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere demo are now live. Those who want to dive in and ink some turf next weekend are able to get their app loaded up now.
Though this lets you pre-load the game, the Splatfest demo for Splatoon 3 will not be open until the specified window. So if you're hoping to get in a week early, you're out of luck.
The Splatfest World Premiere runs from 9 a.m. PT to 9 p.m. PT on Saturday, August 27. The one-day event will see Inklings and Octolings pick sides in a three-way turf war, hosted by the idols of Deep Cut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiuIZN0KDFQ
The three teams are Rock, Paper, and Scissors. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. PT, the action will carry on as usual; teams will fight each other in the usual Splatfest turf bouts.
Then, halfway through the day, it all shifts around. The game mode swaps to the Tricolor Turf War, with three teams fighting at the same time. The leading team will try to defend its turf and hold control of the Ultra Signal, while the other two trailing teams storm in to try and throw the leader off.

Aside from settling the great debate of Rock, Paper, Scissors, this will also be a chance for players to get some hands-on time with Splatoon 3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtMOAvOWTvY
Last week, we got a full Direct on Splatoon 3, showcasing all the features and updates coming to the third iteration of this squid-based shooter. From big additions like an entire new tabletop card game to small ones like an always-open Salmon Run, seems like a lot's on the way for Splatoon. This Splatfest demo will be the opportunity to try out new weapons, new moves, and get a feel for how the turf bouts will go down ahead of launch.
Splatoon 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on September 9, 2022. Grab the Splatfest demo on the eShop here.

Spelunker may be considered by the Japanese to be a “densetsu no kusoge” or “crappy game of legend,” but I consider myself a fan. It wasn’t bad, it was just sort of a jerk. It made bank in Japan, but it then started filling up the bargain bins. So, you have to wonder what led to the development of Spelunker’s sequels: Spelunker II on arcade and, confusingly, Spelunker II on Famicom. Were they trying to make more money off the name, or were they trying to continue the legacy by making a worse game?
I don’t have an answer to that question, and by the end of this article, I still won’t have an answer. Spelunker II: Yuusha he no Chousen on Famicom isn’t terrible. It’s not great, but I’ve played much worse. More strikingly, it has very little to do with the original …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wave 4 is live now through August 26
A new set of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 icons are now available, and all you need to do is log into the Nintendo Switch Online hub and grab them.
This set involves chibi icons of the core cast, as well as two "heroes" (side party members). You can pick them up through August 26, at 9:59 JST — at which point they'll cycle out for something else. They cost a nominal amount of Platinum Points from the My Nintendo system to pick up, and you'll grab them on your actual Switch in the Switch Online app.
Week 4 of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 icons (August 18 tweet):
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1560431971314315265
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Arcade Paradise is a game about tending to a laundromat business while also building an arcade empire in the back room, and if that sounds strangely engrossing, it is — it's the kind of game you can sink hours into, session after session. But as much as I'm enjoying this slow-burn light-simulation-meets-arcade experience, it's hard not to notice lingering issues. With a meaty patch released today, Arcade Paradise is in much better shape.
This will seem like not that big of a deal, but it's now possible to get rid of a certain crushed soda can on the laundromat's window sill — it's been eating away at me!

Live service, free-to-play games are the new hotness. With massive fanbases built around games like Genshin Impact, Destiny, and Fortnite, which are regularly updated with new characters, content, and quests, it's easy to see how other game development studios might be tempted over to the dark side.
Games-as-a-service (GaaS) is a little hard to pin down when it comes to Nintendo, because the Japan-based mega-corp likes to forge its own path in everything.

If you've ever wanted to test out the Pokken series, now is the time: a Pokken Tournament DX game trial is live on Nintendo Switch. Some could have predicted this was coming, as Pokken Tournament DX was announced as part of the 2022 Pokemon World Championships event nearly a year ago as the main event. It's been a weekend of Pokemon news!
The trial is the full game, and honestly, it's a perfect opportunity to try out a fighter completely guilt-free, with everyone unlocked. While Pokken Tournament might not be for everyone, I'm willing to bet there were a lot of people on the fence about it, who would be wooed by a demo — now is the time.
If you partake in the Pokken Tournament DX game trial you'll earn 100 Platinum Points on My Nintendo for your trouble. As a reminder, if you already own the game, you can still pick up the 100 Platinum Points by booting up the full version. Just sift through your library or head straight to the eShop and redownload it. You can find the game here.
As per usual, game trials can be used by anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online account, as trials are a perk for the service. If you want to buy it, you can get 30% off during the trial period.

Minecraft is one of those games where you can play every night for two months, crafting intricate castles and communities with your friends, obsessing over ocean temples and finding The End, and then... you don't touch it at all for six months. Until one day, you see someone doing something cool in Minecraft, and you think, "huh... it has been a while. Maybe I should boot it up again?" And then you play every night for two months. Rinse and repeat.
I'm currently in my six month Minecraft lull, but this incredible project might be enough to lure me back in (if I wasn't about to go travelling for a month, anyway).

There are plenty of big milestones in game development: announcing a new game, getting in the first playable build, and of course, the release. But one of the most exciting parts of that process is when a game goes gold, meaning the final playable version goes off to distributors and manufacturers. It's a culmination of years of work from sometimes hundreds, if not thousands of people, and it's more exciting than it probably sounds.
Well, we got some good news from Asobo Studio this morning, because it just announced on Twitter that its highly-anticipated sequel A Plague Tale: Requiem has gone gold.
The game has been in development at Asobo for three years, but it wasn't announced until June of last year during E3 2021. That's a pretty quick turnaround after A Plague Tale: Innocence, so it's really impressive that the game went gold so soon without any hitches. We don't have any news of a third game in the series yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if Asobo wanted to make it a trilogy.
https://twitter.com/APlagueTale/status/1560641988591882249
What does this mean for us players? Well, it means that we're one step closer to that October 18 release date for PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X/S, and that the ever-present threat of a delay has been mitigated. Other than that, it's just a nice thing to celebrate with developers! They likely pulled crazy hours to get the game all ready to go, so it's an achievement worth announcing for sure.
We got a first look at the gameplay for A Plague Tale: Requiem during the Game Awards in 2021, where Amicia and Hugo continue their journey south using stealth and the environment to their advantage to evade those who might want to harm them, including huge masses of squeaking rats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Check it out in the gallery below
In an ongoing saga of "are the Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak amiibo ever coming out," we can confirm that they are shipping out of Japan for all of you who imported.
As we've reported in the past, the situation is a little strange depending on your region. Some parts of Europe have confirmed tweets stating that they've gotten them already, and Nintendo of Australia/New Zealand put them out on August 12. An internal GameStop memo has provided a window of August 26 or September 9 for a US date. It is expected that there will not be a pre-order period for these in the US, but anything can change.
Today, my Malzeno amiibo figure arrived from Amazon Japan (viewable in the gallery below). The Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico are still on the way, but have shipped. As a reminder, these figures provide costumes (layered armor), on top of in-game lottery item chances. The level of detail in the Malezno is obvious as soon as you see it up close, and in line with the general increase in quality for amiibo as a whole in recent years.
A quick recap of where amiibo stand in 2022 in addition to the Sunbreak amiibo:
Min Min came out in April of this year

Zelda: Breath of the Wild apple farming isn't something I really paid a whole lot of attention to when playing it, but now I'm all about it thanks to this video from I_snort_crayons (a name that made me snort in turn).
As the video shows, it's as simple as walking up to a tree, and using Revali's Gale. Instead of following up with the leap ability, you just cue it up, and the shockwave knocks apples off of the tree. The video creator calls it "non-destructive apple farming," as it doesn't involve chopping the tree down, or causing some amount of chaos to actually acquire the apples.
This Breath of the Wild apple farming method is one of many, many things I wish I knew during my travels the first time around. I can still think back to that era, playing it in isolation before launch: then seeing all of the crazy tweets and tips/tricks folks shared during the week of release. It's a magical time and as I talk about often: it's still paying out!
I know some of you are groaning at the prospect, but we likely have many more years to come of shared Breath of the Wild discoveries thanks to the sequel.
An easy Zelda: Breath of the Wild apple farming method:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what it's like at the beginning of a new year. You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.
It got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.

The lo-fi horror game scene is lighting up, and even as the short and often experimental games accumulate, I don't think we can have too much of a good thing. A new PS1-inspired psychological horror experience called The Fridge is Red is making the rounds with a demo on Steam ahead of a full launch on September 27. It's worth a look!

Part of my interest stems from the peculiar name, but as a Creepshow fan, I also like the premise of a horror story anthology confined to a single video game.

We'll admit it, mind control, transforming into demons and taking on the seven deadly sins sounds like an awful lot to pack into one Switch game, but today's reveal trailer for Bonus Level Entertainment's Saga of Sins promises all this and more.
In a move that we here at Nintendo Life are eternally grateful for, the reveal trailer focuses predominantly on gameplay (what a concept!) so while we may not know exactly what the plot will have in store for us, we can get an idea of the game's eye-catching and original stained glass window visual style. Looking like a Zelda prologue come to life, these visuals will help set Saga of Sins apart from other side-scrollers with a unique take on the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The action-adventure game picks up some new content in September
Kena: Bridge of Spirits is coming to a new platform, and getting an update alongside that. The Anniversary Update goes live on September 27, bringing Kena to Steam and adding a bunch of new features to all versions.
Alongside offering a new platform for folks who want to play Kena: Bridge of Spirits on Steam, or possibly their Steam Deck, the Anniversary Update tacks on more stuff to do.
Spirit Trials, Charmstones, and a New Game+ all arrive in Kenaas part of the update. The photo mode is also getting an overhaul, and there are some new abilities for Kena to use in battle. Charmstones let you customize your playstyle, and special trials test your mettle in archery, platforming, and more. There's even a new adventure in store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXeV9xz5MY
The reveal today says that this Anniversary Update will be free for those who want to dip back into Kena: Bridge of Spirits.
A new adventure awaits
Kena: Bridge of Spirits was a nice surprise last year, bringing a lot of charm and PS2-era action-adventure vibes to PlayStation and PC. While the game's graphics alone probably caught a lot of eyes, and it is a gorgeous video game, it sounds like the action underneath was also a good time.
Of course, this sort of experience seems just right for the Steam Deck. While the Deck is not mentioned on the Steam store page as of this writing, Kena: Bridge of Spirits will at least have full controller support. Fingers crossed?
Either way, this seems like an ideal time to check out Kena if you missed it the first time around. And for old players jumping in, New Game+ and the added content give a little bit more to explore as well.
Kena: Bridge of Spirits hits Steam on September 27, alongside the Anniversary Update.

Publisher Asmodee Digital has announced that it is rebranding to Twin Sails Interactive. The company, perhaps best known for its tabletop gaming adaptations, is hoping to increase its reputation within digital gaming, helping future indie and mid-tier gaming projects find their way onto the market.
The company released the below trailer in order to spotlight its new identity and first incoming releases, which include Studio Nul Games' management sim News Tower and Lumorama's physics-based platformer Amberial Dreams. Both titles are currently available to wishlist on PC via Steam.
"We aim to become a leading game publisher, which means three things to us: a great line-up of high quality, creative titles; an amazing team of passionate game professionals; and a work environment that feels both safe and fun," writes Twin Sails' COO Nicolas Godement of the company's new ambitions. "By limiting the number of releases per year, we are thus able to fully commit the relevant resources needed for the success of each project."

NPD Group has published its sales figures for July in North America, and to no one's surprise, the Switch has had another successful month! The console is once again the top-selling hardware in terms of units sold, and while spending is down compared to July 2021 by 10%, sales are beginning to return to 2020 levels.
The best-selling game on the Switch in July is Monolith Soft's Xenoblade Chronicles 3, despite only releasing on 29th of the month. The gigantic JRPG made a real splash at the end of July, and we dubbed it a "masterpiece" in our review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No further details so far
Sega selling add-on content isn't too surprising, but we may have our first soft confirmation of Sonic Frontiers DLC thanks to a retail listing.
The details come via a Taiwan game seller, who opted to put up an international promo image to incentivize pre-orders (as spotted by VGC). On it, in addition to bonus content, is an ad for future DLC that is "in development." The listing also showcases a November 15, 2022 release date, which could still be a placeholder or subject to change. Thus far, Sega has not provided an official date, but given that it's going to be seen at several tradeshows in the next few months, an announcement could be imminent.
DLC for recent (comparatively) 3D Sonic games has been very muted, so my expectations are a little low. Sonic Lost World had a few free Nintendo crossover lands, and Sonic Forces hosted "Episode Shadow" and "Super Sonic" side stories. But as far as major expansions go, things are light. Maybe Sonic Frontiers will change that, and given the nature of the mysterious Frontiers universe itself, it would be an easy candidate for whisking players away to far-off lands. The Cyber Space aesthetic is already kind of doing that.

While the Switch is selling briskly, there are many who feel the hardware is in need of a power boost – which is why rival handhelds like Valve's Steam Deck have attracted so much interest. While these portable PCs cost more than Nintendo's machine, they offer impressive technical specs – and this has predictably led some people to ponder what a Switch successor could look like.
Chinese firm Aya Neo has already released other Windows-based portable PCs, but its latest effort is notable for being much smaller than other products of this kind; in fact, it's around the same size as the Switch Lite. Our sister site Time Extension has gone hands-on with the device – which is currently doing the rounds on the crowdfunding circuit – and has come away suitably impressed by it, with some caveats.

These packs could be purchased to grant players things like character tokens for instant fighter unlocks, exclusive banners, and the premium in-game currency, Gleamium.

Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.
I did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anybody call for a web-slinger?
Insomniac Games has released the first major patch for the PC port of Marvel's Spider-Man. The patch, which is available to download right now, includes fixes for several issues pertaining to the port's use of ray-tracing technology alongside general improvements to Spidey Stability.
The clunkily titled Version 1.817.1.0 has been pushed out as a small fix to stick a band-aid over some of the port's most egregious issues. Insomniac has noted that it is already working on a much larger update, which will contain a litany of bug stomps as well as directly address issues brought to the developer's attention via player feedback. A release date for this secondary patch was not announced.
Today's update fixes crashes and visual distortions directly related to the use of ray-tracing, while also eliminating random issues that would crop under specific circumstances — such as when playing on widescreen monitors or when Alt-Tabbing out of the game. In addition, Insomniac assured fans it is aware of less common issues — such as a baffling bug that is stopping some players from photographing The Empire State Building — and is continuing to investigate solutions.
You can check out the patch notes for Version 1.817.1.0 right here.
Marvel's Spider-Man is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

For those of us still soaking up the last of the summer vibes, seeing businesses moving to consider their Fall items is enough to send a shiver down the spine. The rapid passing of time is made a little easier, however, by the promise of spooky season and Japan's Pokémon Cafe chain has got us ready to welcome the cooler months with open arms.
Getting ready for the Halloween period, The Pokémon Cafe has today revealed a new range of spooky Gengar-themed items that will be making a jump-scare appearance in their stores from September 3rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As expected, the Dragon Ball Adventure creative island is now live in Fortnite, and you can glide your way onto it right now. 
Once there, players can explore iconic Dragon Ball locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s house, and the Room of Spirit & Time. Plus, players can duke it out in the PvP battle arena, “Tenkaichi Budokai.” 

“We’re thrilled to partner with Epic Games and bring this first-ever Toei Animation franchise integration to Fortnite,” Toei Animation Inc. director of global marketing, Lisa Yamatoya, writes in a press release. “Over the last 36 years, the Dragon Ball franchise has built perhaps the largest global fanbase of any anime. And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” 
Epic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them. Both these islands and the new Dragon Ball Adventure island were created by Vysena Studios.

Many of us were surprised — and a little bit nostalgic — when Japanese developer and publisher Sunsoft announced it would be holding a digital event. The stream took place yesterday after an earlier announcement that cute NES favourite Gimmick! would be making a return later this year. And while the company mostly just teased its future, it did reveal that it will be bringing back another NES action adventure — one that we've called "surrealist" in the past here at Nintendo Life!
This time, it's Ufouria: The Saga, the first game in the Hebereke series. The game originally launched on the NES in 1991 in Japan and the following year in Europe. North America had to wait until the Wii eShop days before it got a chance to help Bop Louie find his friends. (Thanks, Gematsu!)

We've gotten a chunk of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news thus far, but we could always use more! Well, it turns out we're getting it on August 21.
As part of the opening ceremony of the currently-underway Pokemon World Championship weekend, Tsunekazu Ishihara, president and CEO of The Pokemon Company, shared a bit about their information rollout plan. Evidently, as part of the closing ceremony on August 21, we'll be getting info on both the trading card game and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
After Ishihara declared that he had some "news to share about some of our Pokemon games," the crowd cheered, but it was mainly for things already revealed in the recent franchise stream (save Unite). After the big news on Pokemon TCG and Scarlet and Violet was said to be coming later, there were groans in the crowd. You can watch the opening ceremony announcement yourself here at this timestamp, directly after the event opened up on Thursday, August 18. A full recap is also available here.
That closing ceremony is set to take place at 4PM UK local time, in case you're keeping track and want to watch it live. Day 2 of the Pokemon World Championships in London are currently underway. You can watch the festivities here on the Pokemon Twitch channel.
Day 1 of the Pokemon World Championshops is available in its 11-hour entirety below:

And yep, they were right on the money, with confirmation arriving today that the BB Boys will be pulling into Game Pass next week, on August 23rd.

Well, it has been quite the week for Sonic rumours hasn't it? After the third Sonic The Hedgehog movie supposedly had its plot leaked and the upcoming Sonic Frontiers game appears to have tentatively been given a release date and DLC info, we thought we were done with hedgehog hearsay for the time being - but no! According to a Pia interview with Sonic The Hedgehog producer, Toru Nakahara (thanks to My Nintendo News for the heads up), the hotly anticipated animated series, Sonic Prime, may well be speeding onto Netflix this December.
Talking about the success of his production work on the first Sonic movie, Nakahara referred to all of the other Sonic projects that have subsequently burst into reality. One such example was the upcoming series, about which the producer stated (according to Google Translate's services), 'in December a full CG animation called "Sonic Prime" is scheduled to be distributed on Netflix', providing the first hint of the series' release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's live on August 23
A PC Death Stranding Game Pass release is imminent, as 505 Games (the publisher for the PC version) has confirmed the launch this morning. It'll actually go live on August 23 at 5PM PT, at which point it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass for PC.
Here's 505's reasoning for the Game Pass arrival:
"To provide players with greater access to Hideo Kojima’s genre-defying title, in which they’ll reconnect a fractured America, one step at a time."

August 23 is also right on schedule for the Gamescom: Opening Night Live ceremony, where it will likely be mentioned in passing as an announcement to fill time. For real though, this is another slam dunk Game Pass game. So many people are probably waiting on a deep discount, or some sort of miracle to try this oddity out, and now there's no real excuse so long as you have a PC that can run it and a Game Pass subscription (though I'm sure many of you will find a way!).
Weirdly, there will be Death Stranding Game Pass PC items, too:
Chiral Gold / Omnireflector “Ludens Mask” Sunglasses (Color Variant)
Gold and Silver Power Skeleton
Gold and Silver All-Terrain Skeleton
Gold and Silver Armor Plate

The retro mini console follow-up will contain Genesis and Sega CD games, as well as ports that haven't been released before, and a few surprises. Devi & Pii is a unique one, as Sega reminds us that Takashi Iizuka developed it in 1993, before they worked on Sonic 3. Fantasy Zone is a new port (from the team who worked on Darius for the original Genesis Mini), Space Harrier II + Space Harrier has a sprite zoom mechanic, Spatter and Star Mobile are considered "hobby ports" from M2, Star Mobile will be released officially for the first time, and Vs Puyo Puyo Sun is considered a "demake," with only versus mode, and new game rules.

Shopee's listing shows what looks to be promotional material for the game, which lists a potential release date of 15th November — a different date to what was found on Steam last month — along with what may well be DLC.

Does the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.

From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.
It's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

A couple of weeks ago, with no new mainline Arkham game since 2015's Arkham Knight, they started discussing Batman: Arkham World, a fourth game in the series that came out in 2021.

QuakeCon 2022 kicked off digitally today, featuring streams and spotlights on a ton of Bethesda and id Software's games. And while new games are being celebrated, the hits are getting their fair share too. Several classics hit Xbox Game Pass for PC today.
These games range from the fourth entry in the Quake series to much, much further back, like The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, Battlespire, and a few Wolfenstein games.
If you want something a little bit more modern, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate perks now unlock all champions for use in Quake Champions.
https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1560312695546847232
Quake Champions is actually free right now on the Microsoft Store, alongside a few other games. The Elder Scrolls: Arena and The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall are up for download on the Microsoft Store for the low, low cost of nothing. And Heretic: Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel are all on sale.
Add on Doom 64 as one of the current Epic Games freebies, and it's a heck of a week to pick up some older games for cheap.
Let's do the time warp again
Quake actually received an update today, and yes, I mean the classic Quake. Threewave Capture the Flag hits Quake today, bringing back the classic mode and nine resurrected maps.
The Bethesda blog covers some of the history behind Threewave CTF, a mod that wound up being quite influential over the history of Quake. Now, the mod is available for free as part of the enhanced Quake re-release. It even comes with some enhancements, like a status display for your flag and some improved lighting and fog effects.
QuakeCon '22 is underway now, with more panels and streams expected in the coming days. You can find a handy schedule of all the upcoming events here, and follow them live on the Bethesda Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequel to the beloved life sim is ready for early access
Simulation fans rejoice, because Slime Rancher 2 is nearly here. It's been over five years since the first game's release, and fans are itching to dive back into the cozy, adorable world of the Far Far Range. The beloved open-world, FPS life sim is back, and this time, it's going to be better than ever. Slime Rancher 2 will not only be a big graphical improvement over its predecessor, but will also build on the mechanics, characters, and world of the first game as well.
https://twitter.com/slimerancher/status/1560310764321341441
With the early access build, players won't get to see all of the "features, slimes, environments, items, story, etc." that the full game will have to offer, Nick Popovich, the Slime Rancher series director, said in a Reddit post detailing what we can expect. "If you're someone who wants to play through a game all at once in a complete state," he continues, "you can simply wait until the full game is released at a later date."
Basically, the early access version of Slime Rancher 2 will have a lot missing, but if you've just been champing at the bit to play it all this time, it'll definitely be worth it to check the game out early.
Slime Rancher 2 officially hits early access on September 22, and is available to wish list now on Steam and the Epic Games Store. The game will also be available on Xbox Series X/S.
I'm usually more of a full-release person, like Popovich was talking about, but I have to admit that I'm tempted to load up Slime Rancher 2 the minute it's available. We have no shortage of relaxing games coming out this year, so between this and Ooblets both coming out in the next few weeks, I'm gonna be set until Christmas.

Originally due out this October, High On Life will now hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 13, 2022. It joins various other games delayed this week like Planet of Lana and Evil West, and for a similar reason: the team needs more time to make this game the best it can be. 
Here's the studio's statement about the delay, in full: 
"We have good news and bad news. Feel free to choose the option you'd prefer to read first; we won't meddle with your free will. 
The Good News: High On Life is still coming in 2022! The team at Squanch Games is working hard towards developing the best gaming experience to hit your screens, and a little extra time to squash some bugs never hurts. With that in mind, our new launch date is set to December 13, 2022. 
The Bad News: It's a game delay, sorry! Because we're making you wait an additional 6-ish weeks, please accept the linked animation as an apology. 
"High On Life will be available via Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PCs, Day One on Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, and through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Thank you for your continued patience and support." 
As for the linked animation mentioned in the statement above, it's what you can watch below: 
While you wait for High On Life, please find this 500 pound, diaper-wearing alien a wife. Please. He won't leave me alone.

As you can see, it's very Justin Roiland. Enjoy!

That’s a fun headline to read, right? And it’s true because after teasing earlier this week that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding was coming to PC Game Pass, Xbox announced that it hits the service next week. 
More specifically, Death Stranding will hit PC Game Pass next Tuesday, Aug. 23. Now, this might be somewhat surprising for those not caught up on Death Stranding’s journey from PlayStation 4, to PlayStation 5, and then PC. Sony and PlayStation funded Kojima Productions’ development of Death Stranding, and it’s a PlayStation intellectual property. 
However, a PC port was published by 505 Games, and it seems 505 Games and Kojima Productions are free to determine the whereabouts of the PC port of this game. As such, it’s now coming to PC Game Pass, a service owned by…]]></summary>

This was nothing to do with the file itself; even being near another laptop playing the song could cause a crash. According to Microsoft, one of the sonic frequencies in Rhythm Nation coincided with the natural resonant frequencies of a particular laptop hard drive, making it crash. Amazing. Perfect. A perfect bug.

The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.

It's pretty great, in a 'makes the game actually look the way I had remembered it' sort of way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is arguably one of the most anticipated games locked behind the fiery gates of development hell. The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. 
According to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:
Players must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing). Hopefully, this date holds up/reemerges as we move into the new year.

        <updated>2022-08-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. 
This winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. 


In addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.
And for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  
Inkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like the zombies that’ll presumably shamble around in it, Dead Island 2 keeps clinging on to life. Newly posted product listings for the console versions on Amazon US have shed some dying light – sorry – on the eternally-in-development horror game, first announced eight years ago at E3 2014. Here’s that infamous trailer once again, just for old times sake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. 
Happily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here.

MinnMax's Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as "company politics."


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he takes you through a demo of Betrayal At Club Low, an upcoming indie with a unique aesthetic and an even more unique gameplay loop. Wesley's enjoyed what he's played of the game so far, and he'll tell you why in today's New Gameplay Today.
Betrayal At Club Low is exclusive to PC and will launch on September 9 on Steam and Itch.io. Cosmo D Studios is the developer who is actually just one game designer: Cosmo D. He's the designer behind games like Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1. In today's New Gameplay Today, Wesley shows off roughly 20 minutes of Betrayal At Club Low, explaining how its unique dice-rolling mechanic works while highlighting what's so interesting about this strange world and its accompanying aesthetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thunderbolt graphics card enclosures are one of the coolest bits of kit you can get, I think. Open up this metal box, put a graphics card inside, and suddenly any PC or laptop you connect to it via Thunderbolt gets a substantial upgrade in gaming prowess. These docks used to cost around £200 or £300, but recently we've started to see radically more affordable options - and today we've reached a new low-water mark. 
The Lenovo Legion BoostStation can handle GPUs up to 300W (think an Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti or AMD RX 6800 XT), and is available for just £93 when you use the code BANK15 to knock 15% off the price at Ebay.

Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

The studio’s earlier project found players navigating a train on its way through hell, using deckbuilding card mechanics to fight one challenging battle after the next. In Inkbound, the team has held onto the roguelike formula, but almost everything else is going in a new direction.
Players each control a character making their way through a magical world called Atheneum, a place from which countless stories emerge and come to life. Players enter realms defined by books and help to shape and define the worlds and narratives within.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New set images have leaked from the production of Amazon’s Fallout TV show, and they appear to show the inside of Vault 32. There’s also a nice bit of propaganda that reads “The outside world can never hurt you” and shows a superheroic Vault Boy deflecting nukes with a shield. How very Fallout. Read on to take a look at some of the images below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom kicks off next week with Opening Night Live, the annual showcase of trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley. The presentation is generally on par with E3 or Summer Game Fest when it comes to delivering significant news, and we now know a few of the major titles that will appear.
The Summer Game Fest Twitter account revealed that ONL will feature world premieres for Sonic Frontiers, Hogwarts Legacy, The Callisto Protocol, and Return to Monkey Island. That usually means we’ll get new trailers for each game, whether they be gameplay, story, or both. Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games' The Expanse. 
Next Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.

August 17, 2022
Hogwarts Legacy was recently delayed to February, and this will be our first look at it since its gameplay reveal in March. Sonic Frontiers and The Callisto Protocol both graced Game Informer’s cover the last couple of months, and this may be one of the last big marketing pushes before they arrive later this year. Return to Monkey Island, also slated to launch this year, may get a firm release date as well.  
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be streamed on August 23. The two-hour event begins at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.
Even with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.

        <updated>2022-08-17T14:48:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2: Stay Human was released earlier this year and since then, the team has continued to pump new content into the expansive parkour RPG. However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. 
That could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: 


"What dangers await?" a press release reads. "How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal." 
As you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
For more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2. 
Are you excited about this DLC? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Genshin Impact wrapped this business model up in a surprisingly excellent open world RPG, that Graham called one of the best games of 2020. Tower Of Fantasy pulls from a neighbouring gacha vending machine, except that its mixture of MMO, realtime combat, and lootboxing isn't wrapped up in as consistent a package.

Key technical improvements to SteamVR include multiple crash fixes, smoother controller animations and new extension support for the OpenXR platform; the full patch notes are on Steam. But the update also adds a new SteamVR Home setting that – and I quote, with emphasis Valve’s - "showcases CT scans of actual dead bugs we found lying on the ground outside our office." See?

Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series.

As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay.

Výsledky jsou poměrně zajímavé, v průměru lze říci, že Ryzeny (konkrétně Ryzen 9 5900HX a Ryzen 7 Pro 6850U) jsou stále nejlepší, Intel je v závěsu (model Core i7 1280P), ale Apple M2 už k dotažení moc nechybí (M1 pak není o moc horší). Bavíme se přitom o linuxových testech, kde podpora čipů rodin M1 a M2 je teprve vyvíjena, přičemž Apple spíše linuxové podpoře naházel klacky pod nohy, kterými se vývojáři z Asahi Linuxu už více než rok a půl postupně prokousávají.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.
Do you still play Guild Wars 2? Will you be picking it up on Steam to dive in for the first time? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-16T18:44:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.]]></summary>

With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

Ebay is running a promotion today that knocks 15% off the price of brand-new items when you use the code BANK15 at the checkout, and you can use this to pick an RTX 3060 12GB for just £279. 
This is a great price for this mid-range GPU, and it's especially rare to see features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS image reconstruction at this price point.

Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see.

More specifically, OverBorder Studio's take on the action formula popularized by From Software hits consoles and PC on Aug. 18. If you're the type of person who loves a good Souls-like, or if you've been curious about Thymesia for a while now, you're going to want to check out today's New Gameplay Today. Not only does it feature more than 10 minutes of new gameplay, but Marcus, who's reviewing the game for Game Informer, walks Wesley through what works in the game, what doesn't, and how it's different from the countless others like it in the genre.

That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It's also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima, is being developed into a feature film with John Wick director Chad Stehelski set to direct it. The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

Are we sure that isn't Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I'm saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn't... astronommical. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/12/infinity-ward-details-farm-18-a-shoothouse-inspired-map-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2"/>
        <updated>2022-08-12T12:22:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Don't Stress Too Much About Your Cult's Faith Dropping To Zero
Your followers’ faith in your cult drives everything in Cult of the Lamb. If you fail to keep them fed and happy, or if you decline their sub-quests too much, or even simply neglect to clean up their poop, their faith will drop. Any kind of wrongdoing, neglect, or slight against them, can cause them to lose faith in y…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-11T17:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.]]></summary>

Anyway, you can get ten years' worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that's a nice little savings - and of course it's far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

It's capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it's dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port's development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we've decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It's an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
