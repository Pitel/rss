        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie cat adventure Stray has been doing well for itself since it was released last week. Now, it seems other games want to get in on that cute factor. Cue Stray In Doom, which sends Doomguy off for a rest to let a sweet little kitty frag some demons in his stead. Creator Edy Pagaza tweeted footage from the mod earlier this week, and you can now try it for yourself by downloading it from ModDB. You can watch a trailer below. Aww!

Splatoon has a lot of detailed lore and in the lead-up to the release of Splatoon 3, Nintendo's Squid Research Lab has been sharing also sorts of details about the Inklings, Octolings, weapons, maps, music and even the brands in the game.
In the latest social media update, the lab has officially confirmed the return of 'Skalop'. This brand has been in the series since the early days, so it's great to see it is back for the third outing. Here's a look at some squid kids posing in some Skalop gear:

This action is described as a "direct consequence" of GameSparks' servers being shut down - an external service by Amazon, which sustained the online mode.

What's remarkable about them is the photos. Someone at GoodSmile has clearly had a whale of a time showing off the poseable figurines, because every single one features the character in question in some utterly ludicrous positions... almost like the fake art that Animal Crossing's Redd attempts to sell you.

The countryside holds many secrets. And some of those are probably best left undiscovered. At least, that's what it seems like in The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, an upcoming horror adventure from Cloak and Dagger Games.
Cloak and Dagger are no stranger to horror or adventure, having explored the genres a fair bit in previous games. For The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, though, the studio is teaming up with Wadjet Eye Games as its publisher.
Wadjet Eye was founded by Dave Gilbert and has delivered a number of stellar adventure games, like Unavowed and The Shivah. This pairing up seems like one to watch for anyone who likes some creepy horror.
The Excavation follows antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who's writing a book on the barrows of England. As she explores the countryside and documents the treasures she finds, Bateman is drawn to a small village called Bewlay. Things begin to get stranger and stranger, as the locals seem wary and her assistant never arrives. And then the dreams start.

Don't go in the barrows
While horror games are easy to find these days on Steam, folk horror has a bit of a different air to it. Jump scares are easy to find, but a town with some creepy atmosphere and probably some kind of ancient ritual? That's fresh and interesting.
It's been quite a week for unusual and interesting horror game reveals. We spotlighted Slay the Princess, an upcoming horror visual novel about a very scary princess, earlier this week. And now Hob's Barrow is adding more incredible art and creepy vibes to the mix.
Seems like it's a good time ahead for fans of indie horror games. No date's been set yet, but The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is currently planned for a 2022 launch. You can find it on Steam here.

Toy Soldiers HD, an upcoming remaster of the Xbox Live Arcade game, just can't seem to catch a break. After being announced in May 2021 for an August 2021 release, the game was delayed until October of the same year owing to leaderboard issues.
The developers said at the time that they were "absolutely positive" that they would release all versions on October 21st, 2021, which was true for all versions except the Switch. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch release was pushed back, and it wasn't until July 2022 that the developers felt confident enough to pin down an exact release date: August 5th, 2022.

Putting the cat in catastrophe
The second I saw the announcement trailer for Stray, I knew it was a game I was going to play on release day, no questions asked. I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book. While it was pretty easy to get me on board with the premise of Stray alone, one thing I wasn't expecting was just how rich and compelling the story was going to be in this game. I mean, it was published by Annapurna so that should have been my first clue, but even so, it slipped my mind.
To start, the worldbuilding was incredibly detailed and made talking to NPCs, a pretty important mechanic when you'…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gone but not forgotten
Roblox is one of the most popular video games in the world, but even for those who don't play the game, a single sound effect has transcended into meme culture to become instantly recognizable: the "oof" death sound. In the wake of some ongoing licensing issues Roblox has had with sound effects, the team behind the game has announced that the infamous "oof" has been removed from the game entirely. They explained in a tweet from the official Roblox Twitter account that they "created a replacement default sound" and that they "plan to expand [their] Avatar Shop with a whole range of both old and new sounds in the future."

Roblox's trouble with the licensing for the sound started back in 2020, after the "oof" had pervaded online spaces, and video game composer Tommy Tallarico realized that was a sound he created for a game called Messiah. The "oof" was removed from Roblox back then as well, but was reintroduced after Tallarico reached an agreement with the developer, so that creators could buy access to the sound for about $1. It seems that the issue resurfaced and they weren't able to settle things this time, much to the dismay of fans who love the "oof" sound.
The tweet prior to the announcement of the sound's removal discusses the new plan for how sound effects will play a role in Roblox moving forward. The developer stated that they will be getting sounds "directly from the creators and licensors," and that "users will also be able to customize sounds for their avatars in the same way they customize clothing." That sounds like a pretty interesting step forward for the game, but I have to admit it feels like the end of an era with the "oof" sound effect being gone.

Halfway through 2022, that's where I'm at — I'm in the mood for some comfy, familiar gaming; hold the new stuff. I'm fighting the urge to keep moving from one in-the-zeitgeist target to the next, and I don't mind putting my backlog on pause for the near future.

You would be forgiven for forgetting about A Tale of Paper — the Little Nightmares-looking adventure game that was listed for a Switch release last year before disappearing without a trace. This remaster will be correcting that, bringing the original game to the console while also adding three prequel chapters alongside new playable characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kirby is second
Nintendo has provided "most downloaded games in Japan" Switch charts for 2022, and it's looking real good for Pokemon Legends.
Providing rankings for the first half of 2022, Pokemon Legends takes the undisputed crown from every other Switch game: benefitting from a January 2022 launch. Right behind it is Kirby and the Forgotten Land, followed by Nintendo Switch Sports (which is doing better than some expected it to).
From there we dive into third-party land with Monster Hunter Rise, then are reminded of the raw staying power of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which launched in the region in 2014), then we're back to third parties with Overcooked 2, Among Us, and Brave Corps Defeats the Demon King respectively for places six through eight. Then at spots nine and ten we predictably have Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which are hanging on in multiple regions, not just Japan.
The rest of the list is a fascinating microcosm of what does/doesn't work in Japan (the Kingdom Hearts cloud versions seem to be doing well, with two showings in the top 30 overall), and reinforces the evergreen nature of many first-party Nintendo games.
Nintendo also has annual rankings here for 2020 and 2021.

Nintendo of Japan's "most downloaded" Switch charts for the first half of 2022 (Top 10):
Pokemon Legends
Kirby and the Forgotten Land
Switch Sports
Monster Hunter Rise
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Overcooked 2
Among Us
The Brave Corps Defeats the Demon King
Smash Ultimate
Zelda: Breath of the Wild

NIS America has announced that it will be bringing its 2021 remaster Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix to the west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms in 2023. The flashy shmup is already available on PlayStation platforms in Japan and also on Nintendo Switch worldwide.
https://youtu.be/FO-DEnE6TEw
Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix is a revamped — or "remixed" — edition of the 2007 arcade hit Raiden IV, which has itself been revisited multiple times in the years since its original launch. This definitive edition of the vertically scrolling shooter features new levels, alternate enemies, and bullet patterns, as well as several modes including Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Rush. New Dual Play and Double Play options allow for co-op multiplayer action... and even the option for a single player to control two ships!
The visuals have been spruced up to HD quality, while the pulse-pounding score has been fully remixed and re-recorded, offering both new and veteran players the most definitive and electrifying edition of the challenging action title. If you have been waiting on a PC port or a localized release of this title, then you at least know that you won't have too much longer to wait. Better get that trigger finger in gear.
Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix will launch in the west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in 2023. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch.

In Nintendo's latest 'Ask the Developer' post, Monolith Soft developers - including Senior Director Tetsuya Takahashi, Producer/Director Koh Kojima, and Director and Planner Genki Yokota - got together to talk through the visual and sound direction for the upcoming JRPG.

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I've been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I've begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring's boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

Nintendo just rolled out Switch Sports update 1.2.0, and there's a lot to unpack. Here are the big parts with a full patch note rundown. So we already knew this update was coming, but I don't think I was ready for how massive it is.
Here are the quick bites:
One-on-one and four-on-four soccer have leg strap support
You can access a new camera mode via the options, user settings, other menu
Jump height has been fixed/normalized to avoid too much variance
Volleyball now has "slide attack" mechanics (move the stick left and right after a bump)
Bowling physics were adjusted
Global play is in
Playing with friends has been enhanced, with Room IDs
Unstable online connections will now be more visible via a wifi icon in the lower right-hand corner

The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game's design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …]]></summary>

If there's one area that the Xenoblade series has struggled with on Switch, it's performance and resolution — especially in handheld mode. But the folks at Digital Foundry have some pleasant news to deliver regarding Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the latest game in the series which releases this Friday.
Something we noted in our review of the game was that "this new entry is a big step up from its predecessors" in terms of performance. And Digital Foundry has reached a similar conclusion to us in its technical analysis of the game.

You have until August 1 to download last month's free games. In any case, here's what you can expect from this month's three titles:
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Cross-Gen Deluxe Bundle | PS4, PS5
In his review, Brian Shea awarded Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 an 8.75 out of 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revelations: Persona came in third
If you could get one Persona remake, what would it be? Well, Atlus asked that exact same question, and fans answered: Persona 3.
The results came via the Atlus Survey 2022 special program, where they were gathered by Persona Central.
Stuffed into one category (P3/FES/P3P), Persona 3 came out on top, but Persona 2 (Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment) was right there too with roughly the same percentage of votes, coming in second. After that we have Revelations: Persona (Persona 1), then Persona 4 (+Golden), and Devil Summoner: Raidou rounding out the top five.
I think I'd go with Persona 1 or Persona 2. The third, fourth, and fifth entries have been celebrated enough: it would be great to unify the entire series and have all five games in a palatable modern context, potentially even by the end of this console generation (or with some form of backward compatibility). With Persona 3-5 already being preserved again, it would round everything out.
Atlus' Persona remake/Atlus game poll results:
Persona 3 (P3 / P3FES / P3P) (78.9%)
Persona 2: Innocent Sin / Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (78.9%)
Revelations: Persona (76.3%)
Persona 4 (P4G) (74.8%)
Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha series (72.1%)
Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers (69.5%)
Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse (66.7%)
Shin Megami Tensei IV (65.3%)
Digital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner series (62.4%)
Etrian Odyssey series (58%)

A study performed by professors and researchers at the University of Oxford has found that playing video games is unlikely to affect the well-being of the player, either positively or negatively. This finding comes after China announced a three-hour-per-week limit to online video gaming for its younger citizens out of concern for their health, but also after Animal Crossing: New Horizons made headlines for being the perfect antidote to the fear and anxiety of the pandemic.
The study examined 39,000 gamers aged 18 or over, across seven games: Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Eve Online, Apex Legends, Forza Horizon 4, Gran Turismo Sport, and The Crew 2. The researchers also worked with seven "leading video game companies" — Nintendo of America, EA, CCP Games, Microsoft, Sony, Square Enix, and Ubisoft, the developers of the aforementioned games.

We can't wait for that though, right? Through a bit of datamining, a total of 13 additional costumes have been discovered, each of which likely to appear in the game in the coming weeks and months. As with all costumes in the game, the new sets will no doubt be made available for limited periods of time in an effort to encourage users to keep playing and unlock them.

"Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

WWE, a company that has absolutely no need to point eyes in other directions right now, has revealed that it is teaming up with two major video game brands for a pair of brand new in-game promotions, that will see its ring-rocking superstars feature in Epic Games' Fortnite, Psyonix' Rocket League, and Mediatonic's Fall Guys.
Battle royale juggernaut Fortnite will soon be welcoming the presence of one of the industry's biggest and most successful all-time stars: The Doctor of Thuganomics, John Cena. Cena will be dropping onto the landing zone on all platforms July 29, kitted out with his trademark jorts, inflatable finger melee tool, WWE title "Back Bling," and iconic "You Can't C Me" taunt. Unfortunately, it does not appear that playing as Cena will afford you the ability to hit your opponents with the Attitude Adjustment.
I expect Cena to be banned from online play almost immediately given his natural camouflage abilities.

For those of you who prefer your battle arts of the vehicular persuasion, then Rocket League is also currently feeling the pro-wrestling vibe. From July 28, players can purchase brand-new octane decals for their road rippers of choice. The two new designs are styled after the color schemes and shirt logos of both John Cena and the current Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns.
The WWE SummerSlam Octane Decal Bundle will retail for 500 credits.

Finally, over in the cutesy bean-bashing world of Fall Guys, three new costumes are headed to the in-game store. These outfits are stylized after three top WWE stars: The video game-lovin' Xavier Woods, legendary deadman The Undertaker, and yer boy Moyse's favorite, Asuka. These three skins will be available to purchase within Fall Guys during this week's "Blundermania" promotion, which will take place between July 28 and August 1.

Capcom has released its financial results for the first quarter of 2022, which sees the developer/publisher record year-on-year losses for the first time in recent memory.
The company recorded a revenue drop of 48% when compared to the same period in 2021, with a net sales figure of around ¥25.2 billion, (or roughly $184 million USD). Additionally, Capcom's operating income dropped by a huge 49%, with a total of ¥12 billion (or around $87.6 million).

The 2022 quarter was the first in some years where Capcom did not release a new or remade entry in its dominant Resident Evil franchise, which definitely carries some of the fiscal deficit in the new report. To date, Capcom's only major releases for 2022 are t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capturing lightning in a bottle again.
Way back in 2014, Inti Creates—of Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX fame—made waves in the action platforming space when it released Azure Striker Gunvolt, a clear successor to its previous work on the Blue Bomber. Though that initial release was kinda similar to older Mega Man games, this franchise has evolved far beyond those roots as new ideas and gameplay concepts have come into the fold. Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 represents the next step on this path of new ideas, and while it isn’t a revolutionary new take on the Gunvolt formula, it offers up a tightly designed and intensely addictive adventure that no fan of the franchise will want to miss out on.
Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 picks up several years after the events of the second entry and begins by following a new character named Kirin. Kirin is a feisty battle priestess working for a shadow organization that endeavors to contain a new Septimal threat where some Septima users are losing control of their powers and turning into powerful, chaotic dragons. The first dragon that Kirin takes down turns out to be Gunvolt himself, who quickly remembers who he is and joins forces with her to neutralize the remaining dragons and get to the heart of what caused their emergence in the first place.

Our sister site Push Square reported on the trailer earlier this morning, and while we've compared the game to Animal Crossing a few times, the game also has a little bit of Stardew Valley in how you interact with the famous Disney characters, and how you explore the world of Dreamlight Valley.

Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more "realistic".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Merrie Melodies
Yesterday, Warner Bros. Games launched the open beta for its incoming platform fighter MultiVersus, allowing players on both PC and console platforms to step into the ring with its crossover cast of pop culture characters. Already, the MultiVersus beta has seen incredible success, becoming the fourth most popular title on just the Steam platform alone.
The PC dashboard logged an incredible 144,000 players at its peak yesterday, surpassing launch day numbers for any other fighting game on the platform — including Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat. It should be noted, of course, that MultiVersus is a free-to-play title, but that's still a staggering amount of players. When you add in players on Xbox and PlayStation, we could easily be looking at the most popular fighting game beta of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAydKj4j0IA
Of course, these numbers lead to some particularly sweaty servers, and some players found themselves struggling to log in during Tuesday's peak activity period. A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, MultiVersus will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games' implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.
If you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the MultiVersus beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you're ready to rock. The "full" version of MultiVersus will launch later in 2022.

Capcom has presented its Q1 financial report for FY2022, highlighting some seriously impressive cumulative sales for its key franchises.
Despite reporting a downturn in sales and profits YoY (due in part to the launch of Resident Evil Village during the same period in 2021), Capcom's catalog sales grew steadily year-over-year, from 8.8 million to 9 million. The company states that its plan for FY2022 is proceeding as expected with no major changes earmarked for the remainder of the period.

And in follow-up posts, sadfutago asked more, providing more details and images. And then, what really blew up, was the video of it.
This might seem banal, but the thing is, this church is not a known area. No one playing Nier: Automata knew what sadfutago was talking about. This door just seemed to appear for this player, during the A2 section of the game, and led to quite a st…]]></summary>

This third Xenoblade Chronicles game is the latest Switch game for Monolith, a company that both crafts Xeno- games and supports other projects at Nintendo. The first Xenoblade Chronicles was a big hit for the studio, bringing a massive open-world RPG to the Nintendo Wii. Its follow-up, though, proved a little more divisive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

Now that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 reviews are out in the wild, I've seen all sorts of playthrough lengths flying around. So exactly how long is Xenoblade Chronicles 3? Let's dig in!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwG04ZdXCOo
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 core story (and nothing else) is roughly 60 hours
Note: that's a rough estimate, and read the below provisos!
JRPG game length is a hot-button issue, and I came prepared. So for this review, I actually used a timer to keep track of when I deviated from the main storyline. My first clear took around 85 hours or so, and taking away side content and some exploration, I ended up with a 60-hour estimate if you just go for the main story (this is when the credits rolled for me).

The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic could be on an indefinite delay, according to a new investigation. Bloomberg reports that Aspyr Media's KOTOR remake is on hold, after hitting some development troubles.
The remake was announced last year, during the PlayStation Showcase 2021. It's in development at Aspyr Media, an Austin-based studio that has built up a portfolio of ports, especially in the Star Wars franchise.
Bloomberg reports that Aspyr has fired the KOTOR remake's art director and design director this month. Following a series of meetings, sources tell Bloomberg that the project is on pause. Aspyr is reportedly looking for new contracts and development opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8
This comes after a demo was reportedly finalized at the end of June, showing off a slice of the Knights of the Old Republic remake. Studio heads told staff the slice wasn't where they wanted it to be.
Bloomberg's sources point to two issues, via sources familiar with the matter. One is that the project may not have been sustainable on its current course, given the amount of time and money invested in the demo. The other is the timeline. While Aspyr may have been targeting the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg's sources, a more realistic target would be 2025.
A galaxy far, far away
This news is disheartening for those hoping to see some KOTOR sooner rather than later. Saber Interactive, another studio under the Embracer umbrella, joined on the project earlier this year to assist development. Aspyr announced its intent to acquire Beamdog, which has some RPG talent in tow, in April. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake is still officially planned as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PC.
Neither Aspyr Media nor Embracer Group immediately responded to Bloomberg.

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

Everyone's favorite yellow friend from under the sea is back on the gaming scene yet again, and this time he's collaborating with Minecraft. He's a square, everything in Minecraft is a square — it just makes sense. Starting today, players can download the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC (as long as they have the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed), and then they're off on their adventures to explore Bikini Bottom like they never have before. The DLC was created in conjunction with Minecraft creators Spark Universe, and this has to be one of the biggest DLC packs I've seen for the game.
It comes with over forty skins, a huge map with locations all over Bikini Bottom, minigames, collectibles, and more. Of course, you'll get to visit classic locations like SpongeBob's house, the Krusty Krab, and the Chum Bucket, but the DLC even includes more obscure locations from the show like the Barg'N-Mart, Glove World, and Goo Lagoon. Whether you're frolicking through Jellyfish Fields, defending the Krusty Krab from hungry anchovies, or racing at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, you're likely to have the best day ever. Players can also get a free Character Creator item from now until September 16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9914FnO95J8
Based on the sheer amount of content we saw in the trailer alone, this looks like one of the most substantial DLCs for Minecraft I've ever seen. The level of detail in portraying the show's famous episodes is something to behold, and you just know that the creators are really big fans themselves.
Honestly, it looks like this DLC pack is basically a whole new game in its own right, and could keep you busy for a few dozen hours at least if you do everything. I haven't played Minecraft in a good while, but as someone who grew up with SpongeBob, this release has me thinking I might want to crack open the old account again, for nostalgia's sake.

[Update: Fangamer added Hades merch to its online store today, including pins, posters, and prints. The adorable Cerberus and Dusa plushes are $32 each, while the three-print Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium set is a whopping $179.]
Supergiant's fantastic action-RPG Hades is custom designed for merchandise, thanks to its attractive visuals, cool aesthetic style, strong colors, and varied cast of memorable characters. Bafflingly, however, Hades gear has been incredibly hard to come by, with nary an art book or pair of Zubaz pants in sight.
Enter merch-makers Fangamer, who has finally decided, two years after release, to bless fans of Zagreus and his Hades brethren with a fun line of items styled after the game's underworld denizens. While the full line is yet to be revealed, a teaser image appears to include long and short-sleeved shirts, art prints, and a badge set featuring Nyx, Thanatos, Megaera, and, of course, Zagreus himself. No Artemis or Tis, but it's fine.
https://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1549439138587222016?s=20&t=GrFE6W8m9nXAia2XjKzXrg
Perhaps best of all, the image features plush dolls of two of The House of Hades' most important employees: three-headed, bone-munching Good Boy Cerberus, and the lovely, hardworking, and ever-fangirling housemaid, Dusa. Better still, the Dusa plush talks! Yes, I will be purchasing both of them.
Hopefully, the full range will include further shirt designs and/or other cool gubbins, but I'm still stunned by the possibility that Hades is yet to receive a lavish, hardcover art book — which seems an absolute given for such a striking-looking release. Regardless, the fun-looking Hades range is set to launch on the Fangamer site on Tuesday, July 26.
For my wallet, There is No Escape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Meta gets a little more expensive
The price of the Meta Quest 2 is going up next month. Today, the VR company announced the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset will get a price bump in August, tacking another $100 onto the price tag.
This will bring the Meta Quest 2 up to $399.99 for the 128 GB version, and the 256 GB version up to $499.99. Refurbished units and Meta Quest 2 accessories will also see a price increase.
Meta, a.k.a. Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 and shifted the naming convention away from Oculus and under Meta in 2021. In today's statement on the pricing change, the company acknowledges VR's momentum, but also cites the cost of production as a concern.
"At the same time, the costs to make and ship our products have been on the rise. By adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights."

Those who pick up a Meta Quest 2 headset between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 will get a freebie. A copy of Beat Saber will be free to download for 14 days, after they've activated the headset.

The cost of virtual reality
This is surprising on a few levels. First, the Quest 2 has been available since 2020. A price hike without a hardware refresh is strange, to say the least.
But the Oculus Quest 2, or Meta Quest 2, has been the affordable entry point to virtual reality. Its ability to run wireless or hooked up to a computer is a huge boon. And the price point made it a no-brainer for those looking to get into the technology.
It certainly ratchets up the potential appeal of other headsets. For those who already managed to grab a PlayStation 5, the PS VR2 is slowly but surely leading up to its eventual launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spine-busting collectible coming from Apex Toys
Just yesterday, we reported on Storm Collectibles' upcoming premium figure of Guilty Gear badguy... erm... Sol Badguy. But what if you aren't all about Sol, what if you're all about the mischievous but thoroughly loveable Jack-O Valentine? Well, fret not, as Apex Toys has also announced that the Halloween lovin' gal is getting her own figure at some point in the near future.
As revealed during WonFest 2022, (and reported by Siliconera), the new Jack-O figure is scaled at 1/9, which translates to roughly eight-to-nine inches in height... or at least she would, if she were standing upright. Y'see, Apex Toys has teased the new figure with a suspiciously familiar silhouette, suggesting that our girl will be sporting her back-breaking, censor-worrying, meme-creating, crouch pose — the very same pose that took the internet by storm last year in the form of the "Jack-O Challenge."
https://twitter.com/APEX_TOYS/status/1551013041780559873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1551013041780559873%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D336431action%3Dedit
Apex Toys did not release any other info in regards to the new Jack-O pose figure, so we don't know the release window, price, or pre-order dates. But given that we don't even get to see an unpainted prototype, or even any new concept art, we are probably still a long way out from having to explain to our friends and relatives why the centerpiece of our lounge is a young woman in a bodysuit and a Halloween mask is essentially... well... "presenting."
It's a crouch pose, mom. You wouldn't understand.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC. Jack-O Valentine is available as DLC.

This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

        <updated>2022-07-26T18:30:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new update is free for Hitman 3 owners
Hitman 3 just got some new content today, in the form of a new map and more. Ambrose Island is a new locale that's free for any owner of Hitman 3.
The update rolls out for anyone today, so long as they own a copy of Hitman 3 on their platform of choice. That does include Game Pass subscription owners, according to IO Interactive's announcement. The only exception is the Hitman 3 Free Starter Pack, which does not get access to Ambrose Island.
The patch rolled out at 9 a.m. ET this morning, on July 26, and is included in the patch. No need to download anything extra from the store.
As for what Agent 47 is getting up to in these tropical islands? Well, the opening cinematic released today can give you a clue. A former associate of Mr. Grey's needs taking care of, and that will have to include dealing with a local pirate syndicate and disrupting a satellite connection along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWgJNXIOuw
With the update, there are also some new tools and challenges. A special wetsuit and massive machete are among the rewards. There's also a gas grenade with a poisonous frog trapped inside. And heck, even a fishing hook. Plus, new starting locations, stashes, and more await.
The future of Hitman
While this brings a new locale and likely plenty of mayhem to Hitman 3, there's also more in store. IO Interactive has also been refreshing old content as well, adding new challenges and unlockable items.
Plus, the evolving Freelancer mode is planned for somewhere further off in the future. It seems like the World of Assassination is not quite done with Hitman and Agent 47 yet. There will always be targets in need of taking down, bodies in need of a hiding place, and a runway to walk as notorious fashion icon Helmut Kruger.
The Ambrose Island location is live now for Hitman 3 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread the Bad Word
As part of the continued fight against the tidal wave of online toxicity, Twitch has implemented a new tool that it hopes will help streamers to collaborate against regular and/or returning toxic viewers, offensive commenters, and stream-ruining raiders.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the new "Shared Ban Info" feature will allow Twitch streamers with Partner and Affiliate status, as well as those who share a mutual follow status, to share with one another their ban information, allowing other streamers to make a note of the names of previously blocked Twitch users — lest they come crawling into your own stream. This system hopes to give the wider community a "heads up" of sorts on some of the usernames that frequently find themselves blocked from channels.
The Shared Ban Info feature is the latest release in Twitch's increasing efforts to clamp down on toxic behavior, derogatory language, hate raids, and personal attacks logged against its huge streamer base. The service recently improved its notification system to signify to banned users exactly why they were banned, while its new Twitch Ban Evasion Tool was instilled in an effort to prevent banned users from returning under new guises.
Online toxicity remains one of gaming's biggest and most enduring problems. From headset chatter during online play, to the comment sections of websites, Twitch streams, YouTube videos, and social media accounts, the spreading of hateful, racist, and homophobic language have been emboldened by the general anonymity of the internet, as well as an overall lack of real consequence from the platforms that host the abuse.
It is a concern that is likely to continue as long as humans are able to interact with humans in a non-face-to-face capacity. Hopefully, technology will continue to adopt new methods to mitigate the problem.

Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

Another Fallout 76 update is out today, and it intends to "address bugs, including issues that have been reported by the community."
Some of the big parts of the July 26, 2022 update include:
Reduced energy weapon durability
Meat Week reward fixes
Fixing the Grahm NPC (making it so he doesn't wander off and bug a quest)
This game has slowly become an anomaly. So many other studios would have completely given up on it: and a lot of the changes are fantastic. But it always comes with the baggage of "what if the game had more time in the oven to begin with?" It's something that I hope Bethesda is reflecting on in the years to come, as it continues to salvage the reputation of Fallout 76, and its legacy as a whole.
The team also reminds us that currently, you can partake in Pitt expeditions in the public test server (PTS), which is still hosting an early version of the upcoming major Fallout 76 update. As a reminder, the PTS has fully moved to Steam now, and the prior Bethesda Launcher access program is now completely dead. Two missions are available for Pitt expeditions, and the Pitt-themed pennant is still available as a bonus for PTS participants. As usual, all of the current PTS patch notes are kept separately on this page here.
Update Version 1.6.4.78
PC (Steam): 3.0 GB
PC (Microsoft Store): 8.1 GB
PlayStation: 7.6 GB
Xbox: 10.7 GB

It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years.

Well, you’re more limited in choice now, because 2K have removed four of their past WWE games from sale on Steam, leaving just the recent WWE 2K22 and the arcade-style 2K Battlegrounds up. Console yourself by watching the 2K22 launch trailer below, as you weep into your tasselled and bespangled leotard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.
What do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2? Share your thoughts in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg
July 25, 2022
Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a "holy" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, "So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown." McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Rollerskating has gone in and out of fashion too, and anyone who's glanced at Instagram for the past couple of years will know which stage of the wave we're at. Rollerdrome fuses these two oscillating trends in the story of a rollerskating hotshot with a vendetta against human heads. I got a look at the first few levels and, so far, it's a flashy spin on the slow-mo gun fight.

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…]]></summary>

Audible totiž používá DRM a Doctorow, ani jako autor knih a držitel práv, nemůže zákazníkům legálně umožnit ho obejít. Proto raději audioknihy nechává natáčet a nabízí nezávisle.

Either way, you get an impressive level of performance for half the price that some were paying just a few months ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game "by a few months." 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

A message shared by the publisher's Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna's last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven't been heard from in a good while. There's a good chance we'll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak."
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-25T13:10:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.]]></summary>

The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MultiVersus roster expands today with the news that LeBron James, Rick Sanchez, and Morty Smith are stepping into the ring. 


King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-22T16:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s fair to say that this hasn’t been the coolest week on record in many places around the world, so I’m giving Fortnite the side-eye for the No Sweat Summer event that’s running until August 9th. It’s a bit daft, as you’d expect from Epic Games’ battle royale by this point. You’ll get the opportunity to boogie down, race boats and help rebuild Tilted Towers. Watch the trailer below and marvel at how they can all dance without keeling over.

They all want our undivided attention and for Hayden and I, it's fast becoming a bit much. Believe it or not, we're adults with clothes to fold and ovens to pre-heat! Daily quests and inane challenges aren't bringing us back, if anything, they're beginning to drive us away.

Instead, I’ll be a nice lad and keep shtum. Aside from the extra characters, Additional Orders brings more stages and some other improvements to Mercenaries that Capcom haven’t elaborated on. Watch the trailer for it below and imagine being inside Lady D. Oh crap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cycling in video games leans towards the extreme and the exciting: bombing downhill at murderous speeds, professional racing, treasure hunt, and such. I'd like to see more of the mundane too. For many adults, a bicycle is simply a way to get to work, to the shops, or to see your pals. So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag & hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a building game that doesn't need constant babysitting. I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/22/you-can-toss-furniture-as-lady-dimitrescu-in-resident-evil-villages-mercenaries-update"/>
        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-21T20:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

We've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! 
But that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it.

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn. Two years ago, the debut trailer for its third game, Open Roads, was met with excitement.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest free No Man’s Sky update is out today, and it’s a good job Hello Games called the thing Endurance. It takes some serious stamina to scroll through the patch notes. Looks like it might be worth perusing all the way through them though, with this 3.94 update to the game majorly reworking freighter bases and shipping in some NPC crew members to populate them with. This crew will even share their thoughts as they’re wandering about. See for yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. 
Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a vaguely Yakuza sort of way, we've been treated to our first glimpse of what's likely to be Yakuza 8. First spotted by Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura and his team posted a video of them touring Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's offices before he gets his face scanned by a wall of cameras. But before the face-scanning, they record snippets of the Yakuza: Like A Dragon lads having a heated discussion in a small apartment. Ichiban has a ponytail! Apparently, there's a new town? And I got my mum to translate some bits. Sorry mum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post on the official BioWare website, Star Wars: The Old Republic's creative director, Charles Boyd, announced his departure. Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, Lego has dished out its fair share of nostalgia-inducing sets, from massive Star Wars tributes to a faithful, brick-by-brick replica of the NES. Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <id>118801</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/19/yakuza-8-screenshots-possibly-revealed-in-studio-tour"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T13:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

The final product (as reviewed by Katharine) isn’t quite as glossy as the 2016 test footage, but it’s still an impeccably detailed, gorgeously lit slice of cyberpunk – and even so, the PC version can run silkier than a Maine Coon’s coat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

As it turns out, expressing a desire to burn down Bungie's offices wasn't the worst thing discovered.
