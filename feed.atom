Not only that, Niantic also released the shiny version of Dynamax Falinks. This article will dive into ways to catch Dynamax Falinks in Pokémon GO. 


How to get Dynamax Falinks in Pokémon GO

You can fight against Dynamax Falinks in a three-star Max Battle in any Powerspot. But there’s a catch: you have to spend 400 Max Particles to get into a Max Battle. However, you don’t have to worry about the resources, as they are utilized once you have defeated the Dynamax Falinks.


But the availability of the Dynamax Falinks is restricted to 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. UTC, so you won’t encounter it every time in the Power Spots. Not only that, if you are lucky, you can even grab a shiny version of Dynamax Falinks. However, the odds are pretty dim, but it’s worth a shot. 


But remember, you must have a Dynamax Pokémon to enter in a Max Battle against Dynamax Falinks. And just so you know, you will have a better chance to defeat it if you are using a Psychic, Fairy or Flying-type Pokémon since Falinks is the latter. However, don’t use Rock, Bug, or Dark-type 'mon, as Falinks resist them. Once you defeat the Dynamax Falinks, you will get 7,500 XP.


Also, you can also get Dynamax Falinks from other players through trade. But if your friend has the basic version of this Pokémon, then it won’t cut it, as the normal Falinks cannot be evolved to Dynamax Falinks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The launch of critically acclaimed Atlus RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio is here, but a lot of players on PC are experiencing some audio issues when trying to play. Thankfully, some of these issues have some fixes you can try while we all await for Atlus to put out a patch for the problem. Here is how to fix audio issues in Metaphor ReFantazio on PC.

How to fix Low Audio and Echoing on PC


If you're experiencing low audio or buggy, echoing-sounding audio in Metaphor: ReFantazio, thankfully fellow player Claus on the Steam Discussions Board seems to have found a fix. Unfortunately, it requires a third party download to fix it. With so many players shaving this issue, I have to imagine Atlus will work on getting a hotfix out ASAP to fix it, but in the meantime, here's what you can do to fix low audio issues in Metaphor ReFantazio:



Completely close Metaphor: ReFantazio.


Visit the FxSound website and download it.


Launch FxSound and set your preferred output device (such as headphones, speakers, etc.)


Select a Sound Preset, and click save.


Open Metaphor: ReFantazio and go to System > Settings > Audio Settings > Audio Output.


Choose the same device that you picked in FxSound, which should be labeled as FxSound Speakers (FxSound Audio Enhancer) in Metaphor.



Feel free to try other Sound Presets to find one that works with your situation. Some other users have had success going into the sound software for their headphones (like Razer Synapse) and messed with increasing the audio output even further. Of course, if you do this, make sure you turn it back down when you quit playing Metaphor: ReFantazio so you don't blow out your ear drums when you load up another game!


Atlus has not yet acknowledged confirmation of the bug's existence, but hopefully they do so as we head into the weekend. Once they do, we'll be sure to post back here with any official feedback from Atlus in regards to a hotfix.

Creative director Johan Pilestedt and design director Niklas Malmborg announced that the 60-day patch will now be the 63-day patch, releasing on Tuesday, October 15. Why the delay? Well, apparently, someone at Arrowhead forgot to check what day the deadline would fall on. 


It's a Saturday, and, as Pilestedt and Malmborg explained in a short video clip, Arrowhead doesn't release patches on the weekend. The reason? They "don't want to break the game while you're playing the game." The patch has been delayed to avoid a scenario where would-be weekend …]]></summary>

I’m aware that the series didn’t end with Yakuza 6, but at that point, it began transitioning to the Like a Dragon nomenclature.

Vegetarian Taco Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To make a delicious Vegetarian Taco, you'll need the following ingredients:



Chili Pepper


Cheese


Corn


Any vegetable like a Carrot or Corn



To get yourself some Cheese, head over to Chez Remy and buy it from the rat. It might not pass safety standards in our world, but you can get the ingredient for 180 Star Coins. You'll need to complete the Ratatouille realm inside the castle to gain access to this restaurant and Remy himself. 


Corn seeds and the ingredient itself can be bought from Goofy's Stall in Dazzle Beach for 15 Star Coins. Chilli Pepper can be purchased from Goofy's Stall in the Sunlit Plateau for 20 Star Coins. 


You can buy another Corn to make up for the vegetable you need for the fourth ingredient or use something else you're growing like a Carrot. 


Once you have all the ingredients, you can make the Vegetarian Taco by throwing in all the ingredients at a stove from your house or Chez Remy. 


Other Cheese dishes you can make


With Cheese in your inventory, you can make Puffs in Disney Dreamlight Valley. For example, you can create Eggplant Puffs by including the Eggplant, Cheese, and Eggs. It's a three-star dish. You can even make Kronk's Spinach Puffs from the movie The Emperor's New Groove. 


The Chili Pepper can help you make Spicy Baked Bream too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's Episode: Revenant is a series heavily focused on the Stasis subclass, with a ton of artifact perks that enhance things like crystal creation, shattering, and Frost Armor to improve survivability. This has naturally made many Stasis equipment far more viable.


One such weapon that's come from the shadows isn't just because of the updates, but thanks to a new exotic catalyst. Here's how to get the Salvation's Grip exotic catalyst in Destiny 2.


Where to get the Salvation's Grip exotic catalyst in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid


Like many catalysts, the Salvation's Grip exotic catalyst is a random drop from completing ritual activities. This includes strikes, Crucible matches, and Gambit matches. Simply spamming these will eventually net you the catalyst. If you want to cheese it a bit, AFKing in private matches can snag you the catalyst after enough attempts.


Once you have the catalyst, you'll need to defeat a certain amount of targets using the Salvation's Grip. This progress can be tracked through a percentage on the details page of the weapon itself. Once you have 100% of the kills, you can then activate the catalyst immediately.


Does the catalyst make the Salvation's Grip worth using?


The exotic catalyst for the Salvation's Grip adds the Rimestealer perk, causing you to gain Frost Armor when shattering enemies or Stasis crystals. Since the exotic perk causes you to create Stasis crystals and freeze targets under the right conditions, this provides a huge amount of utility to the weapon and makes it great if you don't want a DPS-focused exotic weapon.

The best place to farm Exotic Engrams will be strikes, where you can get a guaranteed Exotic Engram every three, six, and nine strikes completed each week.

You can get the Peacekeepers through Engram Focusing too if that isn't your style. This can be done at Master Rahool in the Tower, provided you've reached rank 16 and reset your rank with him. Once done, this unlocks a third page in the Engram Focusing tab of his menu, where you can spend an Exotic Cipher and an Exotic Engram to get the Peacekeepers. You can do the same for other exotic armor you have yet to get.


Are the Peacekeepers worth using?


The Peacekeepers come with the Mecha Holster exotic perk, which grants you better handling, airborne effectiveness, and movement while wielding a Submachine Gun. You'll also get more damage against single combatants the more you fire at them while reloading those Submachine Guns while they're stowed. This all heavily improves your effectiveness with Submachine Guns, which can pair nicely with great SMGs like the Huckleberry. It's certainly a better exotic in PvP, but that doesn't mean it's terrible in PvE either.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While completing Gohan's main storyline in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, players can embark on an alternative scenario in which he is the warrior chosen by Zamasu, thus giving birth to Gohan Black.


But although you can fight this new variant on multiple occasions during the story, is it possible to unlock Gohan Black as a playable character? And if so, how? Here's whether or not you can unlock Gohan Black in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. 


Can you unlock Gohan Black in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero?


Differently from Goku Black, it is currently impossible to unlock Gohan Black as either a character or a costume in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. The same can be said about his Fused Zamasu variant, which unlike the former —who seems to have access to only the base moveset of Goku Black and boasts a new transformation animation— plays exactly like the character's main timeline version.

Will Gohan Black ever become available? 


To add to our bad news combo, there's no way to know if Gohan Black will ever be released as a playable character, as doing so might demand the recording of new lines and animations. I believe, however, that is very likely that his look will debut as an alternative skin for Adult Gohan in the near future. 


But don't let that put you down, as Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will receive more than 20 new playable characters as part of its first Season Pass, which is set to feature Daima representatives and is almost guaranteed to include the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero fan favorites Gohan Beast and Orange Piccolo. 


You can check out more details regarding the game's Season Pass by heading to All Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Season Pass rewards explained. I also highly recommend checking out how to unlock all of the game's current playable characters so that you can make sure you will have the full roster available as soon as possible.

Vantage Point, like the other Revenant seasonal weapons, is acquired by running the new seasonal activities.

To expedite that grind, equip four pieces of the Revenant seasonal gear for a rep buff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The calendar of events in Final Fantasy XIV is surging forward as always, and this year’s installment of All Saints’ Wake will be returning on October 18. 


All Saints’ Wake is the annual celebration of ghosts, ghouls, and all things spooktacular within Eorzea, and the city states will be decked out with pumpkins, ghosties, and of course, costumed players. 


This year’s All Saints’ Wake is dubbed “The Feast of Thanks for the Foulest Fiends”, and as always, the festivities will begin in Gridania at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre. The Pumpkin-Headed Apparition will be waiting to talk to us from 12 a.m. PST / 3 a.m. EST on October 18, and there’s no telling what he has in store for us. 


The Night of Devilry is upon us

The reward for completing the event this year is a particularly dark and spooky level one glamor set that comes fully set up with dual dye slots to customize your look at All Saints’ Wake. The Night of Devilry set comes complete with:



Night of Devilry Horns


Night of Devilry Shirt


Night of Devilry Fingerless Gloves


Night of Devilry Trousers


Night of Devilry Boots



The second item, which will be available for purchase during the event, is the Flying Pumpkin housing decor item. It's gloriously black, definitely creepy-looking, and perfect for the season. 


You’ll also be able to purchase items from previous years’ All Saints’ Wake celebrations by visiting the Bespectacled Peddler near the starting point for the quest. Last year’s rewards, the All Saints’ Charm emote and Wall-Mounted Vampire Bats housing item, will also be released on the FFXIV Online Store when this year’s event goes live.

We have finally arrived at the home stretch of Masahiro Sakurai's excellent YouTube channel uploads and today's penultimate video is all about the late, great Satoru Iwata.
Over the past two years, we've seen Sakurai get personal on the channel, opening up about his time in the industry with surprising honesty. But today's release might be the most personal of the bunch as the legendary game designer runs through his cherished memories with one of Nintendo's most fondly-remembered faces.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Europa is a puzzle-platformer that’s light on puzzles and platforming, set on (and named after) the moon of Jupiter. This indie title from Novadust Entertainment and Future Friends Games combines pretty expanses of green with futuristic elements. Its playthrough and story aim to both rouse your inner child and give you philosophical food for thought. Generally, all these things could make for a good game. But while none fail here, none really excel either.
As the game takes off, you hear the voice of your father, inviting you to Europa "if you ever get lonely." You take control of Zee, an android in the form of a young boy who totters past Adam’s gravestone (the father in question) to explore the land. You get a jetpack which you use to hover and glide through each area.

A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

As outlined in the new trailer (above), the dev is pushing Date Everything's release back by a few months to ensure everything is in tip-top shape for launch. This includes squashing any pesky bugs, tweaking certain areas and making sure all those romance options are as lovely as possible.

A lot of memorable games (Super Metroid, DKC, Earthworm Jim, Ridge Racer, and Doom II, to name a few) turn 30 this year, but Final Fantasy VI stands out to me because I was privileged to play and beat it a couple of months before its official release.
And, no, I didn’t simply import and play the Japanese version that had been released six months prior. In the summer of 1994, as a fresh-faced, 16-year-old kid, I played to completion an official, pre-release build of the English version.

This review was originally published in January 2015. We're updating and republishing it to mark the arrival of GP Legend (and Climax, which was never released in the West) in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

The F-Zero series has often dished out a steep challenge, and in GP Legend the uninitiated will be given no quarter unless they dig in their heels and learn the ropes. You're expected to tame every brutal hairpin, memorise each risky shortcut, and etch sweet boosting spots into your brain if you are to succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have woken to the sound of multiple former Disco Elysium developers arguing inside your own skull. They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

A new studio called Longdue has been formed by developers from ZA/UM, Bungie, Rockstar, and Brave at Night with the intention to create a 'spiritual successor' to the critically-acclaimed CRPG Disco Elysium.
Precious few details regarding the project are available at the moment bar a single piece of concept art which you can view below, but the project is said to continue the legacy of Disco Elysium while also introducing a new, groundbreaking ‘psychogeographic RPG’ mechanic. Essentially, it means that your decisions in the game will not only affect the people around you, but also the environment, with your charatcer's psyche constantly shifting with the landscape around you.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

The recent release of Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will have had many Switch owners pondering the robustness of their control setup; as much as we like the console's Joy-Con and Pro Controller offerings, they're not exactly ideal for the intense nature of one-on-one fighting games.
That's where Hori's Fighting Commander for Nintendo Switch comes in. The latest in a long line of similar pads created by the Japanese company, this controller has been designed with competitive brawlers in mind.

I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

Those in the market for a fresh addition to their Game Boy Color library might want to check out Sofia the Witch: Curse of the Monster Moon — a brand-new puzzler from developer Jake Macher and published by Bitmap Soft.
This one looks really rather sweet. You play as Sofia, a witch (obviously) who sets out on a platforming mission to save her friends from the clutches of a lunar curse. Despite there only being four central worlds, there are six different endings to unlock and a host of hidden bosses, minigames and secret areas — a little something to take your time over, perhaps.

We were particularly enamoured by The Eternal Life of Goldman's stunning hand-drawn aesthetic when we first glimpsed it at this year's THQ Nordic Showcase, but today's behind-the-scenes deep dive has seriously blown our socks off.
On paper, this platforming adventure is as charming as they come. There's an adorable elderly protagonist, a mysterious backdrop packed with folklore and fairytale references, and what appears to be a sweet gameplay flow consisting of running, jumping and cane-whacking. But the visuals really are the scene-stealer here, and that's what the publisher's new video is all about.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023.

Result! So here’s a little after-dinner mint of a PC gaming hardware bargain: JSAUX’s Steam Deck thumbstick covers, which come packaged with some stick-on decals for £8 / $8. Both 20% off, they be, leaving a price so low I have real hope you’ll forgive me using the phrase "stocking stuffer" in October.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

The first being the most obvious crime: a captain steering their space freighter into harm's way, entirely on purpose. You're there, staring through the eyes of the person in the cockpit. You open the locker and grab the key and insert it into the safety override panel with a satisfying click. You see the plastic casing spring open and the red button emerge. You press it and listen to the sirens whirr. You grab the steering wheel and yank it.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

And if space is the sole concern, it’s hard to get more substantial than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra. Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

As well as money off the finest Steam Deck microSD, there are savings to be had on our tip-top desktop SSD pick, the WD Black SN850X – which is a few years old now, but still produces superlative gaming load times. Or a lack thereof. The 1TB model is down to £70 at Amazon UK, but I think the Yanks have us beat here, as they can nab the 2TB edition for just $140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

He’s mental, he is! Has half a lemonade shandy with lunch sometimes, and wears one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo. Absolute mentalist! Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like Outer Wilds, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun.

Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.

Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.

It now has a release date: November 26th.

Interestingly, reports from France suggest that broadcasters of live sports are already seeing improvements on the piracy front.

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I read the words "The Rocky Horror Show", I am swept into a time warp back to the fan screening I attended in 2005. Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Good, because you need it to stay alive in this horror game about getting stalked through metro stations by a tall creep that nobody else on the platform can perceive. Crowded Followed is basically a playable It Follows, the 2014 horror movie and overt metaphor for sexually transmitted disease. Only this time the slow but unstoppable entity is following you because you picked up a mysterious briefcase from a dying man in an alleyway. I thought I told you to stop accepting random bloodsoaked objects from strange men? Quit it! Anyway, there's a demo for it on Steam if you like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

The update will also include commonly requested features, say developers Sabotage Studio, like tweaks to the combat and a "revamped prologue" that'll see players able to get stuck into the action quicker. We'd previously heard about this update, but now we know the actual release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Ubisoft announced they’d be delaying open world Tsushima-like Assassin's Creed Shadows until 2025, citing concerns over a "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws" in a financial targets update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."
Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.
