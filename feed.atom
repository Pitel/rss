Camelot's classic fantasy RPG series Golden Sun doesn't really get much attention nowadays, but it's still a significant part of the Japanese developer's history. With this in mind, the official company website has apparently been updated recently with some high-quality renders.

Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp was originally meant to launch last year until Nintendo decided it needed some more time in the oven. It then got delayed (again) due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. So when is this turn-based tactical strategy war game going to be released then?
There's a new rumour doing the rounds online that suggests fans of Andy, Sami, Max and co might be waiting until next year. It all stems from Twitter user 'EnterZalman' (as spotted by GameXplain), who recently got an email update about their pre-order of Advance Wars for Switch - suggesting the game won't be arriving until next year.

Education is extremely important, but I hated school. I was never very good at it. I’m not very book smart. Then again, I’m not very street smart. What I’m getting at is: I’m not very smart in general, so school wasn’t right for me.
Self-deprecation aside, I think it’s just the academic system I don’t like. I don’t care about grades. How do you even make a child care about aptitude scores? Do you know what children do care about? Defeating Bowser. So in the early ‘90s, Nintendo loosened its grip on the Mario franchise long enough for a smattering of edutainment games to be produced. They’re not fondly remembered, which is funny because many adults still cling to the edutainment games of their youth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Including Spidersaurs, Towaga, and Various Daylife
With the way agreements often shake out, it's only natural for games to come and go from subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra — but I haven't necessarily associated that ebb and flow with Apple Arcade. At least, not yet. Granted, I don't keep up with the service as much these days beyond the occasional headline, but it's a bit surprising to hear that 15 games are leaving Apple Arcade.
As reported by TouchArcade and The Verge, the timeline is hazy at best.
A new section in Apple Arcade lists the following games as leaving "soon":
Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree
BattleSky Brigade: Harpooner
Cardpocalypse
Dead End Job
Don’t Bug Me!
Dread Nautical
EarthNight
Explottens
Lifeslide
Over the Alps
Projection: First Light
Spelldrifter
Spidersaurs
Towaga: Among Shadows
Various Daylife
Recognize any of them? You might if you were there in the beginning.
I know a few off the top of my head — most notably Spidersaurs, a WayForward run-and-gun game that's now on other platforms like Nintendo Switch, and Various Daylife, a strangely named Square Enix RPG. Many, but not all, have been ported elsewhere.
[caption id="attachment_335442" align="alignnone" width="1440"] Towaga: Among Shadows, one of the planned game removals, is also playable on Steam.[/caption]
Another day, another delisting
We've been conditioned to expect that movies, shows, and games won't stick around indefinitely when they're lumped together in ever-shifting, ever-more-competitive libraries. A proper heads-up with removal dates is half the battle.
I just hope that in Apple Arcade's case, players aren't out of luck when it comes to their game data; the service is in a unique place with no in-app purchases or ads. It would be a shame to invest time and energy into an Apple Arcade title only for it to drop off the list with no other way of picking up the pieces. Games can be so fleeting these days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealt a winning hand
Inscryption was one of the more bizarre and compelling games to come out of last year. And next month, Daniel Mullins Games' creepy deckbuilder will hit consoles.
Publisher Devolver Digital confirms today that Inscryption arrives for PlayStation on August 30, 2022. The store listing is up now for the PS5 version, and Devolver has said it's also coming to PS4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn7OxLub9Y
As for what's coming for the PlayStation version? Well, it wouldn't be Inscryption if things didn't get weird. And some of the new features that PlayStation players will get sound downright unnerving.
Cabin in the woods
When it was highlighted in a recent indie roundup for PlayStation, Daniel Mullins teased that Inscryption would use some of the PlayStation's haptics in particular.
"But what about those exclusive features I mentioned earlier? Well, for starters your faithful companion, a talking Stoat card, will play its audio out of your controller as if it’s really in your hands! Secondly, the atmospheric lighting in the game will spill out from your controller, so if you’re playing in the dark you’ll be one step closer to feeling like you’re inside Leshy’s cabin. If we’re adding sound and lighting to the PlayStation experience then it only makes sense to ensure that Haptic feedback enhances every grisly action… why not use the pliers and find out?"

As for how the game will handle some of the more computer-y parts of Inscryption, I'm interested to see. Games like Doki Doki Literature Club have found some clever workarounds for that in the past, and Inscryption uses some elements that will be curious to see adapted to a PlayStation.
Given the track record though, I think it's safe to say the crew at Daniel Mullins Games to find a way to make it work, though. PlayStation players will get to build their decks and duel for survival on August 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fimbulwinter, here we come
The follow-up to Sony Santa Monica's God of War has to be one of the most anticipated games of the past few years, and as we get closer and closer to that November release date, fans are getting a closer look into what the game has to offer. The last story nugget we got was from the game's cinematic trailer, which confirmed that players will be able to visit all nine realms, but now God of War: Ragnarok has been listed on the PlayStation Store (initially reported by The Gamer), so we can finally get a look at the full story synopsis.
The listing reads as follows: "From Santa Monica Studio comes the sequel to the critically acclaimed God of War (2018). Fimbulwinter is well underway. Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as Asgardian forces prepare for a prophesied battle that will end the world."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIQGI36BxDE
"Along the way they will explore stunning, mythical landscapes, and face fearsome enemies in the form of Norse gods and monsters. The threat of Ragnarök grows ever closer. Kratos and Atreus must choose between their own safety and the safety of the realms."
So now we know the game won't just be taking place during Ragnarok itself, the epic final battle of the gods in Norse mythology, but will also take place in the era that comes directly before it: Fimbulwinter. We already know that Thor and Kratos don't quite get along, and given the fresh take that SMS is giving us on the God of Thunder we know and love, it's going to be interesting to see how Ragnarok shakes things up in the series.
The game's release is approaching quickly after some delays, but something tells me that this is a title that will have been worth waiting for.

Street Fighter 6 fans have been delving into all of the tidbits of tech coming out of Japan Expo 2022 this weekend — which offered attendees the opportunity to get their hands on an early build of the exciting-looking fighting sequel. And, in just a few days, Twitter has been abuzz with some potential tech.
Before the show doors had barely opened, we already received footage of Luke's abominable Popeye-dancing, essentially confirming Perfect Round win poses would be making their return to the series. This fun little note was followed up with some far more integral hits 'n' misses, such as the return of Ryu's dominant cr MK, which was last since dropping fools in Street Fighter III.

The upcoming Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion remaster has some big implications for the series. Aside from bringing Zack's story forward to new platforms, it also seems to be playing a role in the general Remake project.
This post contains spoilers for Final Fantasy VII Remake.
In an interview with Yoshinori Kitase, transcribed and translated by fan translator @aitaikimochi on Twitter, the producer discusses the upcoming Crisis Core remaster. The decision to make Reunion was apparently made in the middle of Final Fantasy VII Remake's development. Since Crisis Core was only on PSP, the team wanted more people to play Zack's story.
The question is whether there could be potential changes in the mix, too.

The hotly anticipated remake of 1994's Live A Live has undergone something of a glow-up. Now appearing in Square Enix's iconic HD-2D style — the likes of which we saw in Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler — the game's trailers look stunning, and we certainly enjoyed those sumptuous visuals when we went hands-on with it a couple of weeks ago.
Outside of the game itself, what better way to show off this newly-revitalised cast of characters than with an original painting by regular Square Enix collaborator Naoki Ikushima? Having worked on the character design team for both of the previously mentioned games as well as Bravely Default II, Ikushima knows what goes into making a piece of art that really pops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Well, I have to admit I didn't see this one coming, even with the current resurgence of obscure fighting titles. Publisher 3goo has announced that it is preparing to rerelease obscure arcade fight franchise The Rumble Fish on modern console platforms. Specific platforms were not announced.
The Rumble Fish, which launched in Japanese arcades in 2004, is a 2D fighter developed by Dimps and utilizing the then-popular Atomiswave hardware. The heavily anime-infused storyline tells the tale of a city crushed by capitalism and opportunity, and the warriors that emerge from the rubble to face a shiny, corporate-owned metropolis, each fighter carrying their own agenda either for or against the new world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next year will be the "most exciting" in Dead Cells' history
Time rolls on, and so does Dead Cells. Today, the team at Motion Twin shared an updated roadmap for the future of Dead Cells, which is set to carry into 2023 and contains some big things.
The team says this update is specifically to combat the belief that, after the latest DLC, Dead Cells is at or near the end of its lifespan.
Currently planned for 2022 is the panchaku update and flame head outfit, as well as some rebalancing and reworking. Then this fall, Motion Twin plans to launch a Boss Rush mode for Dead Cells.
More updates are set for winter as well. Keep in mind these are all rough estimates, and nothing's quite set in stone.

Then, in 2023, the team is advertising the "most exciting year" in Dead Cells' history. Motion Twin says it will be the biggest year since the Dead Cells 1.0 launch.
"What we're getting at here is that we're very much in the mid-life of Dead Cells. We're not sneaking out at night to get drunk on street corners anymore, but we've still got plenty of life in us before our knees start to give in, so prepare yourselves for more Dead Cells content."

Not quite dead after all
To its credit, the Dead Cells team has been steadily rolling out update after update over the years. Even though the action roguelike is roughly four years old at this point, Motion Twin and its spin-off studio Evil Empire have kept on delivering new content.
So, even though The Queen and The Sea DLC went live earlier this year, rumors of Dead Cells fading out of the picture seem to be greatly exaggerated. As for what Motion Twin and Evil Empire have planned for 2023, we'll have to see in the new year.

Rewind with me all the way back to mid-July 2007. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were mere weeks away. New Super Mario Bros. and Wii Sports spun endlessly that summer inside my Nintendo Wii, and I couldn’t wait for the seventh and final Harry Potter book, The Deathly Hallows, to debut. Among all this madness, a little rhythm game about secret agents helping out those in need launched on 13th July in the EU: Elite Beat Agents. For me, this cult classic got lost in that hectic midsummer shuffle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sales show no sign of samurai slowdown
Sucker Punch Productions' acclaimed adventure title Ghost of Tsushima is edging ever closer to the 10 million sales mark, having shifted a hugely impressive 9.75 million copies since its initial release in the summer of 2020.
The new sales figures are noted as part of a wider stat report released by the developer, which details the number of times wannabe samurais have indulged in some of the title's bloodthirsty, (and less bloodthirsty), activities over the course of the past two years. This period has seen an incredible 91.4 million Legends Mode missions played, a staggering 540.8 million Duels engaged, and — perhaps the most amazing stat of all — a huge 998.5 million pulse-pounding Standoffs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3TXsfTCs
Still, despite these bewildering sales numbers, the aforementioned stats are not the greatest Ghost of Tsushima milestones offered by the report. That title is bestowed upon the island's own Good Boys — the foxes — which have been petted by players 75.18 million times. This is perhaps the most relatable of all the statistics, as the foxes are one of the few activities on Tsushima island that provides respite from all the violence and bloodletting. Glory be to the foxes. Here's hoping that they make an appearance in the upcoming film adaptation.
You can check out the full list of statistics in the tweet below. Ghost of Tsushima is available now on PS4, while Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is available to purchase on PS5. This latter edition includes the Iki Island expansion, along with 4K visuals, improved load times, new filters, a Japanese lip-sync option, and support for DualSense capabilities.

Nintendo is splitting out the game from the other contents of the Collector's Edition for Xenoblade Chronicles 3. While the base game will still launch on July 29, the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition contents won't roll out for Europe until after the game's launch.
In a statement, Nintendo says that due to "unforeseen logistical challenges," the company is unable to open pre-orders for the collector's edition until after the game launches.
Rather than hold off on selling the game, Nintendo will be offering the contents of the Collector's Edition as a separate purchase. That way fans can purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 at launch and not have to re-buy the software.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-iNpDKuYb8
The Collector's Edition includes a softcover concept art book, a steel case, and the outer packaging that holds everything.
Pre-orders for the Collector's Edition contents will open sometime later in September. The special contents of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition are expected to be delivered sometime around autumn 2022, and all items will be shipped with free delivery. You can sign up for updates on the Nintendo UK site as well.

A sought-after special edition
The rollout of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition hasn't been smooth sailing. The online store has had a few pre-order windows, and they were usually accompanied by waves of people sitting in a long virtual queue and not making it in. The online storefront even crashed for some. Nintendo has to host several waves of releases as it resolved issues with purchasing physical products on the My Nintendo Store.
Whether this will still be a sought-after Collector's Edition in September, we'll see. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is due out later this month on July 29. As Chris wrote in our preview, the RPG is so far everything he needed it to be.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They're right: the glue looks delicious
If you haven't had a Mario kick in a while, this Super Mario Odyssey ship video will perk you right up.
From the mind of Studson Studio, using "plastic junk" as a base (which looks like a Boston Market takeout container), the Super Mario Odyssey ship (which is literally called the "Odyssey") is born. Cutting out a lot of fluff and elbow grease, the creator walks us through the process in an informative 20ish-minute video, with "obscene amounts of glue" holding it all together.
Like all their creations, it's a feat of engineering, with some trial and error, married with carefully crafted and meticulously planned concepts via digital testing. Tofu containers ended up giving the ship that perfect "metal panel" feel, and comprise the outside of the ship's foundation. Everything from dollar store trophies, to toothbrush heads, to hair rollers. Of course, it all needs to be painted (that starts around 7:30 in), which is in and of itself a whole extra journey and skill — that Studson Studio manages to pass with flying colors.
If you're curious about the rest of their creations: they're just as incredible! The most popular video they have is their astounding Howl's Moving Castle replica that frankly belongs in a museum.

Stray isn't just a good time for cat lovers, it's a good video game, period. A great one, even.
The unassuming protagonist — a normal cat in a not-so-normal sci-fi world in which humans are long gone — is the star of the show. But the game's surprisingly endearing robot companions, and strange, decaying yet vibrant city they inhabit, are also high points. I didn't expect the setting to draw me in and capture my imagination this much.
If you like the sound of a puzzle-adventure game that rewards curiosity and stays fresh the whole way through with a wonderfully fleshed-out world, you've gotta play Stray.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Nintendo gave us a bit of a tease a few days ago revealing that a LEGO Super Mario creation that will stand at over 14 feet tall will be appearing at San Diego Comic-Con. Now, we’ve been given a closer look at King Koopa’s monstrous, bricky final form. And no, you can’t buy this one sadly.
Nintendo of America shared a short clip of this behemoth on Twitter, which is based on ‘The Mighty Bowser’. That already pretty big LEGO Bowser already has over 2800 pieces, but this jumbo-sized display model makes that look pitiful. Built with 663,900 bricks (!!!), it’s sure to tower over attendees who are attending the annual convention in San Diego this weekend.

Reddit first complained about the bug before the weekend, with one user providing an example of how simply viewing items was instead causing the game to roll out the "Show Bucks."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NZXT, having previously expanded from PC cases and coolers into motherboards, microphones, mice, and keyboards, have now launched a pair of 1440p gaming monitors as well. Far from being just another PC hardware thing to check off, they look like they might be alright?


Both hit the 2560x1440 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, with the Canvas 27QHD being a flat 27in screen and the Canvas 32QHD Curved being 32in and… well, curved. They support AMD FreeSync Premium, meaning they should work with Nvidia G-Sync as well, and come with anti-glare coatings to see off reflections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make some space
Nintendo has updated the official page for the newly revealed sequel, and the Bayonetta 3 file size clocks in at 15GB.
It's not quite as compact as a first-party game (Nintendo continues to work its magic, as Mario Strikers Switch is a staggeringly low 3GB!); rather, it's a fairly standard "AAA" size without breaking the bank too much (like say, an open world RPG such as Witcher 3 does with roughly 31GB of space baseline).
For reference, here is how the Bayonetta 3 file size stacks up against the other games on Switch:
Bayonetta 1 - 8.6GB
Bayonetta 2 - 12.4GB
Bayonetta 3 - 15GB
On Switch, physical copies tend to matter more than other platforms. Not only are you cutting out the need for space (as Switch carts don't need to obnoxiously install anyway on your device), but typically, Nintendo games keep their value over time, especially if it's something that's technically first-party (developed or published) like Bayonetta 3.
Thankfully Nintendo tends to keep its file size data updated on the official listings for all its games, so people can plan ahead if needed, and people can do all the storage Tetris they can to prepare. For people with a lot of games, it can get overwhelming sometimes!

Go Nintendo has shared the work of TikTok star @ttptng – Tyler Atkin. Tyler is attempting to revamp his car by using Wii peripherals. That means the steering wheel is – obviously – the Wii Wheel. But he hasn’t stopped there, as Tyler has installed a fully-functioning Wii into his dash, has replaced the top of the shifter with a nunchuck, and has even changed part of the handbrake!

It's a Watch Dogs 2 Game Pass kind of week, as Microsoft has announced the next set of titles coming to the service this month.
Considered by many to be an improvement upon its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 delivered on a lot of promises Ubisoft originally made for the series (remember those bizarre Ubisoft E3 presentations?), and you can play it on PC, consoles, and cloud/mobile on July 19. The rest of the list isn't half bad either, as there's a new game in there (As Dusk Falls), as well as a MotoGP romp, and some RPG love. It's somewhat typical of a stratified Xbox Game Pass launch that has something for everyone. You can find the full list of games below slated for July beyond the Watch Dogs 2 Game Pass marquee offering.
Inside is also a sleeper Game Pass game, and will hit all three platforms later this month. It's definitely something that a lot of people missed, and although it's not everyone's cup of tea, it's hard to argue with "included with Game Pass, so why not?"
Xbox Game Pass week of July 18, 2022:
As Dusk Falls, July 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Ashes of Singularity: Escalation, July 19 (PC)
Watch Dogs 2, July 19 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
MotoGP 22, July 21 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Torment: Tides of Numenera, July 21 (Cloud and Console)
Xbox Game Pass week of July 25, 2022:
Inside, July 29 (Cloud, Console, and PC)

The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport launched an investigation into loot boxes in 2020, concluding with a comparison between these in-game purchases and gambling. Although no formal repercussions have come of this report, the UK government announced yesterday that it may introduce legislation.

It was an exciting time for the gaming community as Nintendo entered the 16-bit era, though it seems certain details from the reveal have slipped through the cracks in the years since — or perhaps just the cracks in our memory!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pilgrim, Evoker, and Summoner jobs are in
There's a new Stranger of Paradise DLC trailer in town (for Trials of the Dragon King), and it's actually pretty informative this time!
The main draw of the DLC will be the extra storyline involving the "Dragon King Bahamut," as well as a tangle with the Warrior of Light. Note that the video itself is a spoiler for the main game, so I'll be vague — but it's kind of hard to avoid the Warrior of Light being front and center everywhere!
Here are the new jobs revealed through the Stranger of Paradise DLC trailer:
Pilgrim (staff wielder)
Evoker (can use spirits that "independently" attack the enemy)
Summoner (controls Bahamut directly)
Trials of the Dragon King will also have a higher difficulty mode (titled "Bahamut"), which seems like a pretty key thing that hopefully will be part of a free update, as well as some quality of life upgrades. Accessory equipment is the biggest thing that stands out, as players can now adjust and utilize accessories to further customize builds.
The DLC is out on July 20, and will be part of the season pass. Future DLC includes Wanderer of the Rift and Different Future — both of which are micro-expansions similar to this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go on and tell us!
Depending on how long you've been gaming, whether or not you remember your very first video game might be a surprisingly tricky question to answer.
Some of you in our lovely Nintendo Life community may be on the younger side, in which case your first game could have been from the GameCube era, or perhaps even the Wii. Others, of course, will need to trawl through the archives for a bit to locate the one; your first gateway into the vast and beautiful world of video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK government has called for games companies to take greater responsibility in protecting children and young people from harm linked to loot boxes, including mental health issues and gambling problems. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that games companies and platforms needed to ensure parental purchase controls and age restrictions were in place to let kids play without the risk of harm, and to put parents’ minds at ease. Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.

Demon Turf, released back in 2021, may have arrived on multiple platforms, but it's one of those games that just belongs on the Switch, right? It's got that 'Nintendo' flair and this was only solidified early in 2022 when the standalone expansion, Demon Turf: Neon Splash, released to rave reviews (including our own!).
Wouldn't it be cool, though, if you could play it on another Nintendo handheld system? Say... maybe the Nintendo DS? Well, you can! As announced by developer Fabraz over on Twitter, you can download a 'demake' of the game for the DS via the Demon Turf Discord server right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember F-Zero?
If you look at the Mario Kart franchise and the F-Zero franchise, it's pretty easy to determine which of the two has been more successful. On the one hand, Mario Kart has seen major releases all the way up to 2020 with Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, and will see a whole bunch of DLC launched for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe all the way through to the end of 2023. Then on the flip side, F-Zero - oh, our poor dear F-Zero - hasn't seen a major release in nearly 20 ruddy years when F-Zero Climax launched in Japan in 2004 - so we didn't even get it in the west! Grumble...
It seems strange, then, to imagine that Nintendo would think to implement a mode within Mario Kart to potentially help the game reach F-Zero fans. Well, that's what very nearly happened with Mario Kart 64 during development of the game in the mid '90s. According to director Hideki Konno, Mario Kart 64 actually once featured a 'no-item' mode that would allow players to focus on the act of driving and compete in "serious races". Eventually, however, the mode was dropped from the final game due to the fact that players demoing the title refrained from choosing the mode.

The UK charts are in – and hopefully, many of you have been staying inside and playing video games! But there’s been a bit of a change up top again as one of 2022’s biggest sellers, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, has shot back up to number one. Seems like the impending heat means people just want to get cosy with something familiar!
That means F1 22 has lost its grip on pole position after two weeks at the top, but it’s now comfortably in second. And racing seems to be the thing as chart favourite Mario Kart 8 Deluxe boosts into third.

The highlight of the week for many Nintendo fans was the long-awaited announcement of the Bayonetta 3 release date. Yes, after years of Hideki Kamiya telling us development is going well, and everything is fine, the teams at Nintendo and PlatinumGames have finally locked in a release date.
Bayonetta is back on 28th October 2022 in an all-new adventure, where you - the player - will fight your way through the streets of Tokyo, the mountains of China and many other stunning locales. You'll even take control of other Bayonettas such as Viola - a "feisty witch" in training who fights with both a sword and a demon.

During June's Nintendo Direct Mini, you may have seen a game that looked a little bit like heartbreaking Disney flick The Fox And The Hound — except instead of a fox, it's a wolf, and instead of a hound, it's a deer. This was Blanc, a gorgeous, monochrome, hand-drawn game from French studio Casus Ludi, coming to the Switch in early 2023.
We sat down with Casus Ludi to find out more about this gorgeous co-operative adventure, focusing on the two adorable protagonists, and whether we can expect to cry just like at the end of The Fox and the Hound...

One big issue with writing for Destructoid while also working a full-time job is that it's very difficult to keep up with those games-as-a-service titles I love while also doing all the reviews, previews, and general articles that are of interest to me. It's too easy for these games to fall to the wayside, which is exactly what happened to Warframe about a year ago. Despite the many hours I put into it on Switch, I just couldn't catch up and keep up with everything Digital Extremes was putting out. Hopefully, I'll be better at managing my time when Soulframe launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon MOBA showcases its competitive chops in August.
Before last year, a Pokémon spin-off in the style of League Of Legends felt like an obscure offshoot, even for a franchise that’s pitched Pikachu as a coffee-swilling detective. In many ways, a Pokémon MOBA makes considerable sense – as a world filled with hundreds of unique monsters and built on battling – but it’s the first time we’ve seen the franchise adapted into a team-based multiplayer game that’s largely propped up by its popularity as an esport.
Pokémon Unite is pitched as an accessible entry point into an intimidating genre, and by most metrics, it’s successful. There are annoyances with the free-to-play model, like the overwhelming amount of in-game currencies and a general lack of polish, but its shorter 10-minute matches, emphasis on scoring points, and reliable, speedy matchmaking, make the experience far more approachable and instantly gratifying in comparison to League of Legends or Dota.

Kayaking is awesome — it's such a rewarding way to spend time outdoors and see a part of nature that many of us don't get to on a regular basis. That said, loading up a kayak with all your gear, driving to a good (not-too-busy) destination, hauling it out, and knowing you have to do it all again once you're done? It can be too much of a hassle sometimes.
While a simulation game isn't going to replicate the real thing, a newly-released PC VR game called Kayak VR: Mirage captures the scenic beauty and chill vibes of kayaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Scales of War
We're looking to the skies once again, retro gaming fans, as Hamster has released another sky-blasting shmup to its ever-expanding Arcade Archives range. It's Namco sequel Dragon Saber, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released into arcades in 1990, Dragon Saber is the follow-up to 1987's fantasy-themed blaster Dragon Spirit, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, Dragon Saber features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game's lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.
Unlike its predecessor, Dragon Saber did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco's previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years. Dragon Saber is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.
You can check out the button-punching action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.

Gummy Cat is delaying part of its launch for Bear and Breakfast. The upcoming B&B sim needs some extra tuning, so while PC players will still get it on schedule, Switch and controller support for Bear and Breakfast has been pushed back.
In a message from the dev team, the studio says that playing with a controller has not felt as good as they wanted. Thus, those versions of the game need a little more time in the oven.
"We are working very hard to finish the extra work, with our goal being to release the game on the Switch as soon as possible, sometime within the next couple of months at most," reads the statement.
The PC version, meanwhile, is still on track for a Steam launch on July 28. However, controller support will not be available for PC players at launch. That will come at a later date, "within the same time frame."

Building a bed and breakfast
While no date's been set, at least PC players can still get hands-on with the game this month. At least, so long as you're okay with mouse and keyboard, rather than a controller.
Bear and Breakfast is a charming-looking life sim game about a bear, running its own bed and breakfast. Having popped up at a few showcases over the last year or so, it seems to be all about attracting customers and gradually renovating your establishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmA6s_fVUHw
It's a fun take on a management sim-style game, and I really love the look of it. For a little extra time to make sure the controller support works alright, waiting's no issue.
PC players will get to open their establishments early on July 28, while Switch and controller users will be waiting just a while longer for Bear and Breakfast.

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Iron & Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft came to me as a request from the fabulous Akeashar. I had never heard of it, but my local game shop had a copy in stock. As I browsed the rack of PS1 games, I couldn’t remember the name. I just knew it was ridiculous, and sure enough, I found it based on that fact alone.
I don’t know. Initially, I thought it might not be that bad. There’s a cheesy ‘90s CGI cutscene that seems to go on forever and doesn’t make much sense unless you read the story in the instruction manual, but the presentation seems like whoever made the UI maybe sort of cared. One of the characters is a werewolf, so that’s always a plus for me.

Happy Friday! Last week we started MADiSON, a new first-person horror puzzle game. It definitely reminded me a lot of Visage, which is one of the spooky games I admire, so I’ve been having a good time. It took me a few hours to learn that you can’t die in MADiSON (so far?) so I played a little too scared, but this time I’m ready to charge around the place.

I think this will be most of the stream, but if we somehow finish it mega early, I’m nearly done with some Dark Souls II DLC and we could chip away at that.
See you tonight for some tasteful jumpscares!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

A My Nintendo Fire Emblem Warriors reward is coming soon, but don't get too excited! For 600 platinum you'll net a memo pad.
Announced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain "full color images" of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular "three" houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.
Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle 'til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude."

Currently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it'll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn't expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs. Stranger things have happened in terms of items running out of stock, but this one should be fine within a 24-hour window of going live; at least.
[Update: And the Fire Emblem Warriors reward is live! It's 600 Platinum.]

It's been a good long time since we've had a reason to bring up Dark Souls: Design Works — and it's amusing to go back and read Chris' thoughts about the art book from 2014. If you're in the mood to look at some badass dark-fantasy imagery, it's never too late. Udon Entertainment has issued reprints of the Design Works books for the whole trilogy.
The main difference with these reprints is that they sport new cover art. I'm sure some readers will prefer the original tome-like cover design, which is classy, but I'll admit that I'm a sucker for the crazed Gwyn concept art — that fiery backdrop really pops.
These hardcover books focus on concept art, key visuals, and character and monster designs, but there are …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's also a demo and sale for the first game
Fuga: Melodies of Steel is getting a follow-up. Developer CyberConnect2 confirms that it plans to release Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.
Melodies of Steel 2 will be a direct sequel to the first game. Not much else is known at the moment, but more news is planned for July 28. A "Fuga: Melodies on the Battlefield" anniversary stream is planned for that date.
https://twitter.com/Fuga_CC2_en/status/1547783715476357121
Additionally, the first game Fuga: Melodies of Steel is on sale for 30% off on the eShop until July 24. A demo is also available, with everything up to Chapter 3 playable and saves transferrable to the full game.
Rev up that Soul Cannon
If you're unfamiliar with the first game, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG about a bunch of young animal children and their giant tank. No, seriously. It follows a band of misfits who commandeer an all-powerful tank to fight back against an evil empire.
It's got a timeline-based battle system where you need to swap around different party members on each of the gun emplacements. Certain weapons tackle enemy types like fliers or smaller ground tanks better, and characters can learn new abilities over time.
And of course, if all else fails, there is the Soul Cannon. Basically a giant win card that will offer automatic victory in key fights, at the cost of a party member's soul. It's uh, bleak, to say the least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGO3bHkNB4
Still, it wound up being a surprisingly fun time that I was glad I tried out last year. It's got some really cool ideas with its party management, battle systems, and Metal Slug-style tank designs. The demo's worth giving a shot if any of that appeals to you, and I'm pretty intrigued in seeing what's in store for the 28th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

Visual-heavy trailer, right? You'll play a detective, Carl Faubert, and yes, there's a dog sled. You'll also travel by boat in search of clues — and survivors — in a remote mining village plagued by an unnatural mist. Parabole is going for the "omniscient narrator" angle again.

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray’s launch is just around the corner, and cat-lovers everywhere have another reason to get excited. Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.]]></summary>

When Sonic Frontiers was first announced, fans were happy to learn that longtime Sonic the Hedgehog comics writer Ian Flynn joined Sonic Team in writing the game. Flynn has been a prominent writer across both the long-running Archie Comics and IDW Publishing runs of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with hundreds of credits to his name. However, joining Sonic Team for a mainline entry is new territory.
"Ian has been working as a comic writer for a long time, so I was very familiar with his work, but after reading the IDW comics, I was even more impressed with his talent," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "That's why I wanted to ask him to work on the story fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. crossover platform fighter MultiVersus will soon be playable once again, this time to everyone who wants to throw down. The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthew is away this week, which leaves me and Nate to take over The Electronic Wireless Show podcast and turn it into a big ol' tower with loads of flamethrowers. That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <updated>2022-07-14T14:49:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."
What animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to? Let us know in the comments below!

First announced during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse is a free-to-play battle royale where players duke it out by brawling instead of shooting. Wrestling moves like suplexes and clotheslines reign supreme, and weapons include steel chairs and other melee items. Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. 


Rumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store. Season One begins on August 18]]></summary>

When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.

In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery.

Bird Snapper is a nice little free game that's just you, an endless grey desert, a bicycle, a howling night, and innumerable antennae and electricity pylons. A walking simulator on two wheels, with a bell.

        <updated>2022-07-13T15:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

A block of crosses, squares, and circles like a snippet of an old GTA cheats page. Wonky boxes filled with letters, like a shed that's just about held itself together after a storm. The rest? 1) WRO; 2) NYYVR; and other babblings of a newborn trying to make sense of the world. They might seem unhinged – they are, a bit – but they're signs of an experience that was really quite fun, and incredibly, made me feel quite clever.

Nonetheless, there are still a fair few offers still running on the WD Blue SN570, a seasoned member of the best SSDs club owing to its high PCIe 3.0 speeds and relatively affordable pricing.


It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK. The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.

To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I've been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.
Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don't have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime's 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down.

A Frog’s Tale, Schim, Frog Detective, Paradise Marsh, Olliefrog Toad Skater, Teacup, Frogsong - it feels like we're in the middle of an (incredibly adorable) frog uprising. Not that I'm complaining, I'm more than happy that our amphibian friends are getting the love they deserve and one such game is Time On Frog Island, a cosy adventure where you play as a gruff sea captain who has been shipwrecked on an island that is chock-a-block with, you guessed it, frogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam. 


Kirby’s Dream Buffet supports local and online multiplayer and will be sold digitally and at retail for an unannounced price.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the word "simulator" in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don't let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games is known for its interactive horror narratives, including 2015's Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and, more recently, The Quarry. Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.
Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, "Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll." However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

But what if you don’t have the Amazon Prime subscription required to partake of them – or if you just don’t like Amazon? Cheap new peripherals/monitors/SSDs/other gubbins can still be yours, as plenty of other retailers are running sales this week to give Prime Day some healthy competition. In some cases they’ll even have the same kit as Amazon but at a matching or even better prices. Thus, this list, which gathers together all of the best anti-Prime Day deals I’ve found.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were to distill the concept of Sonic Frontiers into an elevator pitch, it would likely involve the term "open-world" somewhere. However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.
For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it. 
Yesterday, Twitter user Nors3 shared a screen capture of Liberation HD’s now-defunct Steam page, displaying a notice that states, "At the request of the pub…]]></summary>

And it is, and they are awful. But behind the rude 'tude and Fortnite-grade fashion, Riders Republic makes riding a virtual bike feel like riding a real one in a way few video games manage. Switch to the first-person camera, turn off the music and HUD, and just cycle through American national parks with your bike humming beneath you. Bliss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long been on the "eh, seems okay" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It's a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it's a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting one of the best, and most underrated, Pokémon games from the Nintendo 64 library in Pokémon Puzzle League next week.
On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I wanted a gardening game. The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I've watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.
So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch. And I think I'm enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, "fun" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

Barely a day after British prime minister Boris Johnson announced his intent to resign, Douglas has already added it to his yet-unfinished level. And yes, he's made it even sillier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum's long journey to release nears its end, and after getting a release date and story trailer in May, curious fans can finally see what gameplay looks like in a new video. 
A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.]]></summary>

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

While Cult of the Lamb's impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here's a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card's audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, "spills out from your controller." We're not sure what …]]></summary>

The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today's new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.”

        <updated>2022-07-07T12:17:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.
