After all, doesn't each expansion cause existential crises for players?

That's due to Amazon's ridiculous budget, sure, to the multi-episode structure that allows the story to grow unrestrained, but mostly due to the great writing and acting behind its characters. That's always what earned Fallout a place in the hearts of fans, and I'm glad the showrunners noticed that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ID@Xbox Showcase, Kaizen Game Works, the developers of 2020’s Paradise Killer, has revealed their next bizarre crime drama, Promise Mascot Agency. The absolutely bonkers-looking open-world game is PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2025.


In Promise Mascot Agency, you play as Michi, a disgraced Yakuza member who is put in charge of the titular agency for mascots, and you must turn the business around. While trying to run a legitimate-ish business, he must also unravel the conspiracy that led to his exile.


Also, you’re helped along the way by Pinky, who seems to be an anthropomorphic severed finger.




Like Paradise Killer, Promise Mascot Agency is an open-world game. It takes place in an area called Kaso-Machi, and you get a pretty sweet truck to drive around in. But beyond just solving crime, you also have to actually manage the mascots who come to you for representation. This often leads to hilarious hijinks where you help these abominations using “Hero Cards” to get them out of trouble.


It looks spectacular. I reviewed Paradise Killer way back when it was released. It was one of my favorite games of that year, and has stuck with me since. You probably could have struck my interest with “from the developers of Paradise Killer,” but the trailer delivers beyond that with just a feverish representation of Japan. Damn, I’m excited.


Unfortunately, I have quite a while to wait, as Promise Mascot Agency launches on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2025.

The intimate pack of three games is due to be released this year and marks Jackbox's first foray into the world of mature gaming with three provocative games designed specifically for adult players.




What's in the box?


According to Jackbox, an overwhelming number of fans have indicated in customer feedback surveys that they want an adult-theme Jackbox Party Pack, which is just what the team is doing with Jackbox Naughty Pack. The three adult-themed games will still deliver on the promise of making you laugh, while also adding a more risque style of entertainment than is present in the previous iterations of the Party Pack.


Previous Jackbox titles only require one person to own the game while others can access the party-style gameplay using their own at-home devices such as phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs as long as they have an internet connection. This makes me ponder two questions immediately: Who's going to create a Jackbox Naughty Pack lobby and invite their friends, and what sort of devices are compatible with this pack? Actually, I'm not sure I want to know.


Jackbox Naughty Pack is set to release later this year, and the team plans to reveal more information about its three adult-only titles throughout the summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase, Poncle has released an amazing update for Vampire Survivors completely out of nowhere. The Laborratory update drops today and is as bewildering as it is spectacular.


I’m at a bit of a loss here because Poncle already does a better job at covering their big reveals than I could ever hope to. Whatever devious bastard they have in charge of their bulleted lists has them down to an artform. They describe it as their first “AAAA” update, and say it includes “1 character, 1 secret character, 3 weapons, and 2 stages, including a bonus go-cart racing stage.” They go on to say that the update also has “industry-defining innovations include fully rendered running animations, mind-blowing train physics, go-cart racing, and doors that open.”




Damn! After all these years, they finally caved to the demands of the community and added their most fervently requested feature: Opening doors. So much for having principles.


The Holiday-themed update arrives just in time for that special season when big-box retailers roll out the Christmas playlist to inspire the rabid consumer in all of us.


If you’re confused and thinking that a Contra-themed update was supposed to be released around this time, I have good news. That wasn’t just a shared hallucination. Vampire Survivor: Operation Guns is right around the corner on May 9, 2024.


As for the Vampire Survivors Laborratory Update, it’s free and will be released for all platforms today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From former Alabama head coach Nick Saban to previous Heisman winners, college football fans have made many predictions about who will be on the EA Sports College Football 25 cover. After months of speculation, a leak may help narrow down the field of potential candidates. 


College football reporter Matt Brown reports that the EA Sports College Football 25 will have multiple cover athletes for different title editions, featuring current players across multiple power conferences. Additionally, Brown claimed that all athletes play different positions, meaning there would only be one quarterback, running back, and more. Based on that set of criteria, there are a few noteworthy college athletes that check every box. 





Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado quarterback Shadeur Sanders, Colorado receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter, and Georgia quarterback Carson Beck will be at the top of most college football fan wishlists. However, potentially only having one QB would make that list of top candidates much smaller. 


This would also rule out all players who officially got drafted into the NFL over the weekend. Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels, Marvin Harrison Jr, and Malik Nabers could have been phenomenal candidates after shining on the field last season, but they have reportedly missed their window. 


As for when players can finally get their hands on the highly anticipated sports sim title, leaks point toward a July 19 release date, with more information to come earlier in the summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recently released Update 2 for Project Mugetsu (PM)  introduced several new Shikai to the game, once again changing up the meta. With eight total Shikai in PM at the moment, you may be wondering which is the best Shikai in Project Mugetsu. Here's what you should look for.

Best Shikai in Project Mugetsu


The best Shikai in Project Mugetsu as of Update 2 is the Nozarashi (Kenpachi) Legendary Shikai that was added in Update 2. Even though the new Ichimonji (Ichibei) Legendary Shikai is also very strong, it has no heal making it fall out of favor when compared to Bankai.


However, an already existing Shikai, the Ryujin Jakka is also incredibly powerful with certain builds. The new Minazuki (Unohana) Legendary Shikai is also a solid choice, but is not quite as good as the Nozarashi or even Ryujin Jakka.


Project Mugetsu (PM) Shikai Tier List in Update 2


Being Legendary Shikai, Nozarashi and Ryujin Jakka aren't exactly the easiest to acquire. As such, we've put together a Shikai Tier List updated for Update 2 of Project Mugetsu that includes all eight Shikai so you know what to work towards. 


You'll want to strive towards obtaining the S Tier Shikai, but even the A Tier ones are formidable options. The B Tier Shikai are versatile enough to be worthwhile until you're able to move on to A or S Tier ones, and the C Tier Shikai should be avoided for the most part except in specific scenarios. Here is our Project Mugetsu Shikai Tier List as of Update 2:


S Tier



Nozarashi


Ryujin Jakka


Minazuki



A Tier



Ichimonji


Senbonzakura



B Tier



Kamishini



C Tier



Hyorinmaru


Zangetsu

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were synonymous with gaming in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, largely thanks to their influence over arcade brawlers. Games like 1989’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also known as ’89 Arcade) and 1991’s Turtles in Time are time-honored classics that shaped the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre, and 2022’s Shredder’s Revenge demonstrated that the style is still viable in the modern landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley is incredibly successful due to the marvelous cozy vibes and nigh-limitless replayability options it offers. But players have found it's lacking something: the companions of Baldur's Gate 3. 


Not to worry, though, as Stardew Valley modder Xun and their team are working on bringing a map and various characters from Baldur's Gate 3 to Stardew Valley.




What parts of Baldur's Gate 3 are coming to Stardew Valley in Baldur's Village?


Via Twitter, Xun mentions that their mod, Baldur's Village, will introduce a new map and four Baldur's Gate 3 cast members. You'll get to interact with fan-favorites Shadowheart, Halsin, Gale, and, naturally, Astarion.


The mod team says that only Astarion gets to be dateable right now, but Xun assures that Astarion will feature a unique romance plot and that more characters could join the dating roster in the future if things go well.


The mod still isn't out, but Xun's team has already completed the artwork for the map of Baldur's Village, four different styles of buildings, and the designs of Astarion, Shadowheart, and Gale. Below you can check out Astarion in one of many pieces of artwork teased by Xun:

Xun closes by thanking Himetarts and Wildflour for the creation of some free assets used in Baldur's Village. You can check out their mods here.


The team hopes to release the first part of Baldur's Village before the first anniversary of Baldur's Gate 3. While you wait, you can enjoy Stardey Valley on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Baldur's Gate 3 is available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.

Note that some livestock have similar uses, but all of them have different purposes. It’s never an either/or decision where you need to choose between strengths and weaknesses for a task. There is no overlap. With that in mind, here are the different livestock.


To note, these are the Livestock you can buy at the Livestock Trading Post. There are also goats and chicken that are kept at Artisan plots and produce food. These are simply passive resources, and you don’t need to actually worry about the animals …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jackbox Party Packs have always allowed for adult-themed responses, but it was never solicited or directly encouraged by the games themselves. For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.
We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.
However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.
Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!]]></summary>

This could be recency bias, but Vault Boy is much more iconic than he used to be, partially thanks to the Amazon Fallout TV show. This figure is seen in the fictional propaganda from the United States government, before the universe's nuclear fallout occurred. He adorns all the tutorials for players in the game and has a smile that you can't forget.

Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

We are still a little way off the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch on 23rd May, but thanks to last week's hands-on previews, we now have confirmation of the game's frame rate. Nintendo's latest remake will run at 30FPS (down from 60FPS on the GameCube original), but this is not a decision that the developers will have made lightly, suggests Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon director, Abebe Tinari (thanks, My Nintendo News).
The director recently took to Twitter to state that they "can empathise" with the Paper Mario devs, drawing from their personal experience on Bayonetta Origins to explain why the game might not run at the higher frame rate that many were expecting.

Terry Pratchett created one of the most visually engaging franchises when he wrote the first Discworld novel, spawning a series of covers that I actively look out for and collect every time I'm in a used book store. The stories themselves are also brilliant, with touching emotional moments, fantastic comedy, and sprawling arcs that go beyond the books themselves and into reality. But the series is so vast and vibrant that it can be difficult to know what order you should read the books in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After waiting at the edge of their seats all weekend, Madfinger Games finally confirmed when Gray Zone Warfare Early Access will begin, and it's most likely earlier than some players would have thought. 


Madfinger Games announced that Gray Zone Warfare Early Access begins on April 30. The devs previously revealed four different editions of the title, ranging in price from $34.99 for the Standard Edition to $99.99 for the Supporter Edition. Players can find each version on Steam, but they cannot complete a purchase until the official release date. As to what players can expect on launch day, the devs urged players to be patient with overall performance of the title.

"We are working overnight to prepare all of the servers. We do expect some hiccups, but we are at it non-stop," Madfinger Games said. 


If players didn't get a chance to participate in the original playtest, Gray Zone Warfare is a new immersive tactical FPS that challenges users to explore an island in Southeast Asia and attempt to collect valuable resources and items. AI-controlled enemies and other users will also be on the map fighting for survival. 


Madfinger Games CEO Marek Rabas also apologized to content creators and streamers for being unable to give out keys to test the title a week before release, but further fixing from the playtest caused a delay. It's unclear what time the title will go live, but players can either wishlist the game on Steam to get an update or follow Gray Zone Warfare on Twitter for live updates on the server status.

Sure, you can come to some reasonable conclusions based on the trailers and preview footage, but there's nothing quite like a good comparison video, is there? Well, lucky for you, we've got one right here. We take a look at some footage from the original GameCube release and the new remake on Switch, before splicing them together for a good ol' fashioned side-by-side comparison.

What is Gray Zone Warfare?


Described as an immersive tactical FPS with a "maximum focus on realism," Gray Zone Warfare sees you join a PMC sent to an island in Southeast Asia; one that was completely evacuated following a "mysterious event." Your goal is to investigate the island's secrets and bring back anything of value, but you'll have to contend with AI-controlled enemies as well as other players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's camo challenges or new weekly tasks, there are plenty of ways to earn rewards in MW3. A common challenge is to get kills while Strafing, but if you don't know what that means, it can be tough to do. 


Getting kills while in Tactical Stance is a popular quest set by Sledgehammer, but they do tend to switch it up in the weekly challenges and slot Strafing eliminations in there too. In this guide, I'll explain what Strafing means, and how to get Strafing Kills in Modern Warfare 3. 


Strafing is a useful tool to have in your arsenal. Image via Activision


What is Strafing in MW3?


Strafing is moving side-to-side without turning your character. Essentially, imagine getting up off your chair and standing up, then taking a step to the right and back to the left. Doing this continually is Strafing. 


How to get easy Strafing kills in MW3


To get Strafing kills in MW3, you need to get the elimination while performing the Strafing motion explained above. For a helpful advantage, make sure to use the Stalker Boots which boost your Strafing and ADS movement speed, while I find an SMG like the WSP Swarm is the best gun to use. 


You should be Strafing all the time


Even if you don't have a Strafing challenge, you should still consider adding it your bag of tricks and doing it during matches. Strafing makes you a harder target to hit, as the side-to-side movement makes it difficult for your opponent to keep their crosshair on you. 


In a gunfight, it could make the difference between victory and defeat, so add it to your arsenal and see how much it can help.

While the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. 
Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All the feels.
Publisher Little Nook and developer Hyper Luminal Games have today announced that the cosy adventure game Pine Hearts will be bringing all of the emotions to Switch on 23rd May.
Billed as a "love letter to all those who have experienced loss," Pine Hearts will see you playing as Tyke and setting off through the titular caravan park which they used to visit their father. There looks to be a colourful cast of characters to meet and some sweet puzzles to solve along the way, all while Tyke revisits the memories of their previous vacations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Joy-Con buttons may also be a thing.
Ah, another day, another 'Switch 2' rumour (we know you love it). Following hot on the heels of a recent report detailing a new magnetic controller set up, the latest information dump comes courtesy of Chinese peripheral manufacturer Mobapad (thanks Wccftech and GamesIndustry).
According to Mobapad's blog post, the Switch's successor will be a "conservative evolution" of the current models; more akin to a "refined Pro model". As previously rumoured, the system's screen will indeed be larger and support 1080p resolution (the current Switch consoles max out at 720p), while the new larger Joy-Con controllers will adopt an 'electromagnetic suction docking structure' controlled by electric current.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter user pl_evil has helpfully translated a recent letter to shareholders from Bloober Team, showing that their new game "Project C" will be revealed later this year. This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon have SHOCKED and RATTLED the world of buying things off the Internet, by announcing that Prime Day 2024 – their latest of their Prime-members-only sales events, which usually take place in July – is taking place in July. And yes, we’re only hearing about this a mere month after the last big Amazon discount splurge, Spring Deal Days. My life is a calendar where every square has "deals" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.
Still, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.

There is a second hell in Helldivers 2, a hell made up of wartorn planets and soldiers who fight bile-spewing bugs and robots. And it is a hell that is subject to patches. One such update has nerfed a bunch of weapons including the popular quasar cannon. It's also increased the number of enemy patrols based on player numbers and tweaked the game's level generation, with the former making life more difficult in hell, and the latter possibly making things more interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks very 3D World-inspired.
When a publisher reveals that its upcoming game gives off 'Super Mario vibes' or 'Legend of Zelda vibes', we often can't help but chuckle under our breath, mutter "okay, we'll see about that", before scrutinising the trailer and coming up with any excuse as to why that's not the case.
With Microid's The Smurfs - Dreams, which the publisher outright states is "serving up some serious Super Mario vibes", we did the exact same thing. But you know what? Yeah, we can see it. Now, we're not going to sit here and say that it's going to be a genre-defining platforming and stand toe-to-toe with some of Nintendo's best, but it definitely looks like it's heavily inspired by the likes of Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Romancing the polls.
The SaGa series is one of the most unique franchises to come from RPG behemoth Square Enix.
Often known as Final Fantasy's "weird" cousin — though that's a little bit reductive — SaGa was created by Akitoshi Kawazu, one of the game designers on Final Fantasy II, which is often considered the odd one among the Final Fantasy titles. On the surface, Final Fantasy II is pretty similar to its predecessor, with one big exception — levelling. Instead of gaining experience points, your party improves depending on the actions they take. So attack will increase the more you attack, and depending on what weapon your character is attacking with, their proficiency with that weapon will improve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Truly goated.
Though the peak years of the 3D platformer genre were in the late '90s and early 2000s, there’s been a bit of a resurgence in interesting new genre entries in recent years. Titles such as Glyph and Lunistice have shown that smaller platforming projects can be just as compelling as the more well-known examples, and now we have BogoSoft's Corn Kidz 64 continuing that trend with something decidedly retro. Following the adventures of a spunky goat named Seve, this title aims to emulate the spirit of an N64 platformer as accurately as possible. It largely succeeds; Corn Kidz 64 actually feels like a lost game from this era, and even though it has some notable shortcomings, this is overall an enjoyable and fun retro romp.
Corn Kidz 64 is a true collectathon at heart, tasking you with picking up various doodads squirreled away in every imaginable corner of these modestly-sized playgrounds. Your main collectible is a large collection of cubes that grant you “XP” for each one you grab—after getting enough of them, you’ll be able to unlock doors that gate access to harder challenges that hide even more cubes. Additionally, there are other things to do, like knocking over all the trash cans in a level or finding a small collection of bottle caps to exchange for corn syrup, which raises your max health.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.
Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

Another week is almost over, which means it's once again time to kick back, relax, and play some games.
Before we do, however, let's just do a quick recap of some of the stories from this week. First up, Nintendo expanded the NSO service with two N64 games, which is always welcome in our book. We also got our first proper look at Tales of the Shire, the new Lord of the Rings-themed farm sim for the Switch. It looks... okay..? See what you think.

In any case, I shall endeavour to continue Alice0's great work in finding endless excellent vintage illustrations to pop at the tops of these posts. And I'll also be hiding a little smiley face in each one, for giggles. Ooh, can you find it? What fun!

In the heyday of the tennis-sim video game genre, Top Spin and Virtua Tennis were the best players in the crowded space. However, in the time since the genre’s boom settled, the offerings have fallen off considerably, with both franchises going more than a decade without a new release. TopSpin 2K25 signals the reemergence of the critically acclaimed series, and though it’s been a while since it stepped on the court, it’s evident the franchise hasn’t lost its stroke.

        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tales-of-kenzera-zau"/>
        <updated>2024-04-26T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zau do you do?
The best thing we can say about Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is that it’s a decent gateway game into the Metroidvania genre. The Switch is so chock full of incredible titles at this point that it can often be difficult to know where to start (we can help with that too, by the way), but Kenzera provides a relatively breezy 6-7-hour experience that should give you an indication as to whether or not to dip your toes in a bit further. For genre veterans, however, while the gameplay is certainly good enough to see you through to the end, there’s little here that hasn’t already been done elsewhere… and better, too.
What elevates the game, however, is its setting and story. If you’ve been following Tales of Kenzera's development at all, you’ll know that a great deal of the plot takes inspiration from Sugent Studio’s creative lead, Abubakar Salim, and his personal experience dealing with parental loss. Incidentally, Salim (a stage and screen actor and the voice of Bayek in Assassin's Creed Origins) also provides the voice for protagonist Zau, and we have to commend the voiceover work as a whole; it’s brilliantly done throughout and helps the plot resonate a lot more than if we were merely reading lines of dialogue.

        <updated>2024-04-26T17:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hint: it's teeny tiny.
If you've ever wondered what was actually inside a Nintendo Switch cart, then wonder no more, dear reader. Over on YouTube, Tinker Man Mick has uploaded a Short (okay, it was uploaded in July 2023, so we're a bit late, but who cares) to demonstrate that some Switch carts actually have quite a bit of empty space.
Cracking open a copy of Let's Sing 2021, you can see that the board within does indeed fill the entire casing, while a copy of Super Mario Odyssey actually has quite a bit of unused space. Now, the video is titled 'Why Does Nintendo Do This?', but we think it's fairly obvious. Switch carts are pretty small to begin with, so making it even smaller would no doubt make it more difficult to handle while leaving much less space for publishers to attach their printed game labels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes there’s a game that’s just a delight to write about, however you slice it. That’s how I feel about getting to tell you about Oyster Wars, a platforming game that melds the fluid movement of Celeste with the puzzle dungeons and hookshot traversal of Zelda. Oh, and top of that it’s about rebelling against capitalism via oyster farming - and it’s made by a real-life oyster farmer. Let’s get into this package of joys.

It was Steam's most wishlisted game before launch, and it's so popular right now that Steam's servers are struggling to keep up: there's an official developer post on the game's Steam forum warning that "the store is overwhelmed from all the people buying, it may take a couple tries for a bit while things calm down".

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?
In the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.
Perhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. 


I've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James made the observation that Lethal Company, a co-op game about being haunted space binmen, and this month's pick for the RPS Game Club, gets less fun the better you are at it. This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask "Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.

They're mostly just there to give you an early quest involving goat banditry or windmill rats or some such other domestic drudgery. Or, in the case of Tristram’s mayor in Diablo, to fret behind the scenes about how to properly fit considerable cathedral repairs into this month’s budget. Well, no more must this valuable civil servant hide behind balance sheets, occasionally popping out to cut a big ribbon in celebration of a nearby mausoleum being turned into a Wetherspoons. Tristam is a 72 hour Ludum Dare project where you play as said town’s mayor. And this time: It’s ceremonial!

The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. 

The actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to "all subsequent DLCs" as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.

Even though it's been almost a decade since its release, Fallout 4 has rocketed to the top of sales charts like a mushroom cloud into the atmosphere, which makes today's update perfectly timed: Fallout 4 is finally getting a proper next-gen update.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/25/todays-dragons-dogma-2-update-makes-dragonsplague-more-visible-pawns-less-annoying"/>
        <updated>2024-04-25T15:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.
An update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!
https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv
April 25, 2024
For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.
Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.
There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.]]></summary>

We thus use this as an excuse to spend some time talking about The Lord Of The Rings games we'd like to see, plus our favourite Rings games from days gone by (and also Gollum, and also we do impressions of Gollum).
Nate has been playing an impressive number of games, including one that did not allow him to invent the stick and therefore hampered his progress. We also talk about AI NPCs again, because one of them tried to get James drunk. Plus: some lovely recommendations to round off your weekly pod (one of them is a long life meat product).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement trailer for Lost Legions opens with a Roman Emperor bellowing “GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS” like a kid who’s just had his pudding taken away. I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. 


I mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.

And from the times I've played Lethal Company, I've come to think it's also a game about appreciating the mundane, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 4's "next generation" update goes live today. Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a "variety of quest updates" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to "stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth".
They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you're similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of my time in Lethal Company is full of tomfoolery, panicking, and ultimately letting the quota down. As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.
This had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?
Sure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.
So, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?
Join me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire. After all, once this month's Games Club is finished I'm not sure they'll even let me back on the ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The closest I have come to having any interest in sport is when I got really into reading about football hooligans, or like, Blood Bowl, but I do absolutely recognise the romance of it all. SUDDEN DEATH is a delicious free slice of playable art-pie that celebrates that romance. It is - says dev Cécile, who co-made the project with Nat Pussy and MOTHER GOOSE for collective Domino Club - “a game about love and sports. it's gay, it's very australian, and it's great.” You can tell it’s Australian quickly, because people call chips ‘chippies’, which makes me chuffed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a "mini-rework", which means drugs like morphine are "less of a 'solution for everything'". Wait. What?


Submariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have "a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations." Well. Guess I'll just die.

It must be the baleful influence of Creative Assembly's latest free update for bellowing strategy bonanza Total War: Warhammer 3. Out 30th April, the update introduces Epidemius, Proctor of Pestilence - a new Nurgle Legendary Lord who gains rewards based on how many ickle diseases you’ve spread to other factions (already my favourite aspect of playing Nurgle in the game). Does Epidemius also get buffs if the player is infected by something? I hope so. It would be a consolation to know that my ailing trachea is contributing to the Nurgle cause.


That’s not the only new addition in TWW3 patch 5. They’re also bringing a Gold Wizard hero, who is sort of Magneto but blingier, and a cursed crown that will make everybody hate you. Let’s dig in.

These represent perhaps the first major challenge to mechanical keyboard hegemony, but you may be wondering: who’s Hall? What’s their effect? And does it actually make for a better gaming keyboard? Time to found out.

We liked the game and were impressed by the depth of its action and world-building. Ahead of its release, but after spending some time with the game, we had a chance to reconnect with Shift Up CEO and Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim after speaking with him earlier this year. This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.


Game Informer: There are multiple endings?
Hyung-Tae Kim: There are multiple endings and actually, if you complete certain quests, there is a post-credits clip, as well.

Another Crab's Treasure, as the name suggests, is a humorous and pun-filled world where the sea is your Soulslike oyster. A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector. What follows is an adventure that excels at being an amusing and bright reprieve from the otherwise dark an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of Soulslikes have about as much joy, and the same colour palette, as a burning cowpat. They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land is like a sanitised manga-ish Mad Max Fury Road, where there are fewer explosions and nobody huffs paint and screams "Witness me!". So, arguably, a less cool Mad Max. In this incarnation it's an open world action game with light RPG elements; in previous incarnations it is a manga and anime by the creator of Dragon Ball. My takeaway from playing Sand Land the game is that it is a tremendous advert for the manga and anime, in the sense that everything good about Sand Land the game is from those, and I would rather be reading or watching them instead.

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story. Other elements of the game, like its …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely "Republicans buy sneakers too", if you ask me.
It made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When, in town building simulation Manor Lords, you erect your first manor, it feels natural to place it in the center of your humble 14th century European settlement. It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it's been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…]]></summary>

The June 2023 reveal of Star Wars Outlaws gave us our first glimpse of Kay Vess and Nix, the two protagonists of the game. From talking with Massive Entertainment during our recent trip out to Sweden to get our hands on Star Wars Outlaws, it sounds as though their bond will be special. However, they aren't on this journey alone, as they are joined by a trenchcoat-wearing BX-commando droid named ND-5. Though Kay and Nix were greater points of emphasis during our studio visit, we had to ask the developers about the internet-popular droid that joins the Star Wars Outlaws adventure.

EGX, of course, will feature a bunch of classic and upcoming games, while Comic Con is laser-targeted at our respected allies in the world of on-paper image-based storytelling with speech bubbles. EGX's headline partner is TikTok this year, which makes this a perfect nexus of entertainment artforms.

In it you run a big pub with room for a lot of grizzled adventurers, in a dog-eat-dog dark fantasy RPG sort of a world - think a roadside pub in one of the early seasons of Game Of Thrones, before everyone hated it. You do a lot of plate-spinning drudgery like cooking, cleaning, and serving, but also eavesdropping, rumourmongering, and knowing when to slip in a ribald joke as a distraction while you size up a mercenary's sword.

But IDK, there’s something about the ravages of mass industry that doesn’t quite gel with zoomorphic raccoon baristas and other such wholesome trappings. Have you ever encountered a cuddly smokestack? How about a cuddly just-in-time network?
Combine cosiness with automation, and a lot of the time, you end up with some kind of macabre joke, like Palworld. Or at least so I thought before I discovered Sweet Transit, out now, which seemingly resolves everything by means of a hearty injection of trains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.


Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.

Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.
You can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.]]></summary>

I've always felt that I, too, would like to one day find an artwork that I could describe in the same way. Partly because it sounds like an interesting experience, but mainly so I could steal that line and feel like one of those elite, urbanely perceptive, multiple trouser-owning critics.
Well, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn't, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It's more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.

        <updated>2024-04-23T13:41:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has revealed a new setting for Fortnite that allows players to hide emotes the company considers "confrontational." This doesn't outright ban these emotes from the game and those with them can still use them, but if someone has this new setting turned off, they won't see others use them. 
Called "See Confrontational Emotes," players can choose whether they want to see emotes like "Laugh It Up," "Take the L," "Whipcrack," and "Make It Plantain" from anyone, from friends in a party, or never. Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. 
This new setting can be found under "Social Privacy" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game.

The good news is that the grim action-RPG’s wonky performance is already being straightened out, with two of its three hotfixes thus far delivering a noticeable improvements, even on older graphics cards.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/23/metaphor-refantazio-gets-october-release-date-in-new-gameplay-trailer"/>
        <updated>2024-04-23T12:47:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. 
Dubbed "The King's Trial," this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. 
Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. 
If you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. 
The trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.
Here's what the Collector's Edition looks like: 
Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

"A lot of the philosophy that I approached New Vegas with was the philosophy of Fallout 1, or how I interpreted it," Sawyer observed. "Fallout 1 was foundational for me in understanding how role-playing games should be made."

I’m more efficient at clearing up scrap, less prone to fear-spasming inside out when a monster attacks, and have become wise to most of the haunted houses’ deadliest tricks. All of these, it turns out, make Lethal Company a worse game.

We get a look at a new rural town and the activities you can get up to, like bounty hunting. Travel on your magic mech is compared to "camping", which I wasn't expecting. And there's lots of combat on show, with transitions from real-time to turn-based battles outlined in a bit more detail. Oh and it's coming out in October, which gives me plenty of time to clear my JRPG backlog before this inevitably takes over my entire existence for the foreseeable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s it like to watch a smash hit TV show set in the backyard of a game you’ve made? It’s a question which Fallout: New Vegas project director Josh Sawyer is uniquely qualified to answer.
“The show really does capture the aesthetic of Fallout 4 and 76, while also feeling like it is set on the West Coast,” he says. “If you’re a fan, then you can see where the plot elements have been pulled from in previous entries. And if you’re new to it, thankfully, those plot elements are fairly straightforward. So I think it’s a good show for fans and a good show if you’re new to it, even though there’s a lot of stuff going on. I’m certainly interested to see where they’re going in the second season.”

The trouble was, all my friends liked football and I have an abiding hatred of popular things, a hatred that has obviously served me well during my later career as an online news journalist. I played hockey instead, which is the superior sport in that you get a big nasty stick, but also relatively niche because you need more equipment.
Still, I've enjoyed rediscovering football in videogames, and especially videogames that don't treat football with much respect. You may have played or at least heard of Behold The Kickmen - now, here's free downloadable Itch.io offering Cereballers to stick the boot in.

The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.
Fortnite Festival Main Stage: 4.23.24 pic.twitter.com/dxaQBsqD4A
April 22, 2024
Eilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.
Eilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for "What Was I Made For" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game. For more Fortnite, check out the current Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover and read about the upcoming Star Wars event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of last year I played the demo for An English Haunting and got very excited. I like horror that has a generally spooky, creeping dread vibe rather than being wall-to-wall cheap jumpscares and gore, and that sort of stuff is thin on the ground. But it'll be less so from May the 15th, cos that's when this ghosty point and click puzzle adventure is out! Hooray! The demo is still on Steam if you want a taste before then. In the meantime, the release date announcement comes with a new trailer to enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest is just a few months away, but that's not stopping Xbox from hosting its own indie event next week. Partnering with IGN, the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase will air live next Monday, April 29, at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. The event will feature "epic trailers, fresh gameplay, and new reveals," according to the announcement blog.
This announcement is brought to you by great indie games 📣

Tune in to the ID@Xbox x IGN Showcase on April 29 at 10am PT: https://t.co/ODYWGtHqzB pic.twitter.com/KdkACE03Ri

They've also given a heads-up on some games we can expect to see. Vampire Survivors, which cracked our top ten games of the year back in 2022, has been on the platform for some time now, but recently announced a new expansion featuring weapons and characters from the Contra series. Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
For more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.
You can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel. The showcase will also be available in American Sign Language.
What are you hoping to see from the showcase? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until I played Tales Of Kenzera: Zau I figured people had run out of ways to make original platformers, but an Afrofuturist story-in-a-story framing for a mythological platformer about healthy ways to deal with grief sure did teach me to not underestimate human creativity. I really liked a lot about Tales Of Kenzera, and got annoyed by a bunch of stuff too - and the division seems to be that a lot of the former falls on the story and design side, and the latter on the mechanical side, which I guess isn't ideal for a platformer. But still, I think it's worth persevering.

In Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios, the use of the word "Tales" is more literal than it initially seems. To kick off the events of the game, protagonist Zuberi reads a book written by his late father about a place called Kenzera. He uses fiction to cope with his grief, just as the player might do with the plot of the game, and as the studio founder, who lost his father as well, did when creating the story to begin with. While combat and map design in Tales of Kenzera falters at times, th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company that recently sold Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive for $500 million, has announced its plans to split into three individual, publicly traded companies. As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed mass-layoff-manufacturing corporation Embracer Group are dividing into three companies, which will be listed separately on Sweden’s stock exchange. Those companies are: Asmodee Group, which comprises Embracer’s tabletop games biz; Coffee Stain & Friends, an evolution of the existing Coffee Stain publisher, who will pursue "a dual focus on indie and A/AA premium and free-to-play games for PC/console and mobile"; and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends, “a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, as well as the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties, among many others”. 

After writing roughly 100,000 posts about Embracer’s butchering of vast swathes of the games industry, this is surely my chance to raise a cheer and celebrate the conglomerate’s unglomming with a cool glass of turnip juice, but it is Monday, the man next door is shouting again, and I am tired - so tired that only ill-suited Simpsons references come to mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rising Up is a free, sub-fifteen minute browser game that’s a bit like Streets of Rage, where you play a balding office worker and beat a giant scanner to death within the first 30 seconds. This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.
Created by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.

This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a "studio apartment". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. 


Lucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must "draft" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.

In either case, the Maw must be sated, and fortunately, there are quite a few appetising video-or-computer games out in the next seven days, with at least one behemoth landing on Friday.

One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” A small child dressed as legally distinct Sailor Moon chirped this trite little phrase at me about an hour into Rabbit and Bear’s Suikoden successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. I’m not sure when I realized the adage applies to Hundred Heroes itself as much as it did to whatever the child was talking about.

While visiting Massive Entertainment to be among the first to get my hands on Star Wars Outlaws, I enjoyed playing through stealth sequences, shootouts, conversations, and open-world speeder gameplay. However, one piece of the Star Wars Outlaws puzzle I did not get a chance to experience firsthand is the space gameplay. Thankfully, in addition to playing a chunk of Star Wars Outlaws during my time in Malmö, Sweden, I also had a chance to ask the developers how the game works once you jump into your ship and leave the planet or moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fabletown gang will be back, developer Telltale Games has promised in a new development update for The Wolf Among Us 2, its sequel to The Wolf Among Us it announced in 2019. This update, which reveals the studio is still hard at work on the game, arrives after an unspecified number of layoffs hit Telltale Games last October. 
"We've been quiet because we've been heads down, focusing on the promise of [The Wolf Among Us 2]," the update reads. "While we can't give a big update yet, here's a little something for you: in-progress shots from the current build. The work continues. The Fabletown gang will be back. Thanks for being fans." 
The four in-progress shots from the current build of The Wolf Among Us 2 can be viewed below: 

The Wolf Among Us 2 was originally due out last year but was delayed out of 2023 in a March update from the studio. 
For more about the game, watch The Wolf Among Us 2's official trailer, and then read about how the game's first episode will catch you up on what happened in the first game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 
Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

This news arrives just over a week after the series' release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Fallout review, so we're excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2's production.

It also joins a string of other successful video game adaptations, like HBO's The Last of Us, which is getting a Season 2 next year, Peacock's Twisted Metal, Netflix's Arcane, and Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
Fallout Season 1 is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it's too early to speak to any performance issues, it's clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a t…]]></summary>

The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.]]></summary>

Children of the Sun is hellbent on occupying your mind. During the six hours it took me to hit credits, I was engrossed in mastering its simple, yet wonderfully executed central mechanic. At first, taking down dozens of cultists with just one bullet was a fun gimmick to tinker with. As time passed, I became obsessed with pushing the tools at my disposal to their limits, repeatedly using people as target practice until I had concocted a satisfactory murder plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man, Insomniac Games began building one of the richest video game interpretations of the Marvel Universe that we've seen to date. The studio nailed the tone of Peter, Miles, and their supporting cast, but it was the care put into the rest of the universe that makes Insomniac's universe stand apart. Yes, the Easter eggs and references to heroes like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Black Panther, and more make this feel like an established universe full of superheroes, but Insomniac took things to the next level with its rogues' gallery. 
As a longtime Spider-Man and Marvel fan, I've delighted in watching my favorite villains – and those I rarely think of – pop up throughout the multi-game journey. Check out all the villains in Insomniac's Spider-Man universe below, and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.
New #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡

Tune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.

April 16, 2024
It's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.
If that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.
We won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail, arrives this summer alongside the game’s first graphical update. As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8]]></summary>

As you navigate the galaxy in Star Wars Outlaws, you do so as Kay Vess, a pickpocket-turned-thief who gets in over her head and winds up with a bounty on her head. Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a "resourceful underdog" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.
In the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!
