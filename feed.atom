        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing the game during the 2022 Game Awards and giving the game a proper trailer last week, Ascendent Studios is back with a new showcase for the title, this time focused on gameplay. The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.


For a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.]]></summary>

The Pokemon Company is very sly with a lot of their mainline Pokemon distributions, and we have yet another one that's live now in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. You might be thinking: well, we just got some Mystery Gifts! Well, you're right! You can read all about them here, but this one deals with two TMS.
Thanks to a new email distribution in Japan (cataloged by Twitter users like Makio & JRoses), we have another code: R0CKANDBAT0N.
Here's what you get from the Scarlet & Violet R0CKANDBAT0N code:
Stealth Rock (TM116)
Baton Pass (TM132)
Well, it does what it says on the tin! One of the key advantages of taking free TMs via the Mystery Gift system is time saved. If you need to adapt to a 7-Star Tera Raid and swap some abilities around, you won't need to either go to a store and buy the TM yourself and/or you don't need to create it using the TM machine.
Stealth Rock is normally crafted by using 5000 LP, Rockruff Rock x3, and Rolycoly Coal x3: which is a tad more valuable than Baton Pass, which only needs 3000 LP, Eevee Fur x3, and Girafarig Fur x3.
How to redeem Mystery Gift codes in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet
After the treasure hunt starts (read: following your full tour of the academy), you can select the mystery gift option in the main X button menu. Here’s how to find the mystery gift menu:
Press X and select “Poke Portal”
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find “mystery gift,” then select that option
Select “get with code/password”
Enter the code(s)

As part of its second Sunsoft is Back stream, Sunsoft has announced that a remake of the 1991 NES title, Ufouria: The Saga, is on the way.
If you didn’t catch the Sunsoft is Back stream, you didn’t miss much. Ufouria was essentially the only new reveal, and all we got was a screenshot. They showed off Trip World DX and Gimmick!, but we didn’t even get a release date for Gimmick! beyond “soon.” Trip World DX previously received an announcement, with Limited Run Games handling the physical versions of it. Pre-orders start April 28.
Ufouria: The Saga (known as Hebereke in Japan) notably never released in North America prior to its arrival on the Wii Virtual Console. However, it has never been ported well. The Virtual Console re-releases run at the PAL region’s 50hz, making everything run too fast. Despite the poor quality of the ports, Ufouria: The Saga has developed a cult following.
Unlike Gimmick!, which is just getting a modernized port, Ufouria will enjoy a full remake, with the demonstrated screenshot showing off a crafty art style similar to Yoshi’s Wooly World. We don't know much else aside from a planned 2003 release. There is no word on whether the character depicted in the screenshot will have the western “Bop-Louie” nomenclature or revert to the Japanese “Hebe.” Personally, I think “Bop-Louie” is just such an amazingly cute name.
The horrible Vtuber running the stream makes coy mention of two unannounced projects. We can only hope that one is the rumored Clock Tower port/remaster/remake. We’ll have to wait and hope for a better stream in the future.

Several weapons and playstyles were reworked/re-tooled as well, and tons of monster bugs were addressed (including an annoying problem with the Magnamalo fighting the Velkhana).

Five years ago today, Nintendo told the world to get creative and create pianos, fishing rods, and — eventually — a giant cardboard VR headset. That's right, Nintendo Labo is half a decade old, and as we look back, we're feeling a little bit fond.
Debuting in April 2018, this quasi-toys-to-life creation may have essentially been pieces of cardboard that came with instructions to create fun ways to interact with Switch games, but it's unabashedly Nintendo. It's unique, promotes play and creativity, and no one else has tried it yet.

In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still, that $80 price tag...
One of the big questions surrounding the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection announcement back in February was whether or not the games could adequately translate a game devised for two-screen devices into a single-screen experience. It's not impossible, as we saw with Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! earlier this year. Now, we have an idea of what the game will look like when it launches in a few weeks for Nintendo Switch and PC.
Yesterday, Atlus dropped a new trailer for the HD remasters that includes a detailed look at how dungeon mapping will work, as well as building your squad and battling monsters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zB2IkAXS0
As much as I like these games and as much fun as I know I'll have with them, I just don't know if the stars will align for me this year to actually play them. Etrian Odyssey games are a huge timesink, and getting three at once would basically take up two months' worth of free time for me. Also, there is a non-zero chance I won't still be playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by the time these games roll out.
Still, I just may have to pick them up and keep 'em on hand for when I do have the time...like when I'm 80.
Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection will launch for Nintendo Switch and PC on June 1. Each game will retail for $39.99, or you can buy the three together for $79.99. Preorders are open, and if you do buy early, you can unlock Atlus-themed character portraits for each of the games, including Aigis from Persona 3 Portable, Nahobino from Shin Megami Tensei V, and Joker from Persona 5 Royal.

Nintendo has got a ton of stellar indie titles on sale for just one week. Following yesterday's Indie World presentation, the Big N has slashed the prices of multiple hit titles from smaller studios by up to 75%.
The sale is on from now until 26th April at 11:59pm PT, and we're not biased here, but there are a lot of titles that we reviewed rather well. Dead Cells' Medley of Pain bundle is one of the highlights because it comes with the Return to Castlevania DLC — one of this year's highlights already, for sure. Plus other indie stand-outs like Hollow Knight, Hades, Celeste, and Neon White are all on offer.

Just like the first Oxenfree, there’ll be plenty of flexible walking and talking where you’ll be able to interrupt conversations at any time, or just stay silent throughout, which would be creepily on-brand for a series about ghostly rifts and unsettling radio frequencies.

Atari has announced that they’ve acquired “100 PC and console titles from the 1980s and 1990s.” That’s not impressive, Atari. I own way more than that.
“This is a deep catalog that includes groundbreaking and award-winning titles from Accolade, Infogrames, and Microprose,” said Atari CEO Wade Rosen.
The full list of purchases hasn’t been disclosed, but the mentioned titles are, “Bubsy, Hardball, Demolition Racer series, as well as the 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.” This deal also results in Atari gaining the Accolade and GTI brands.
What? I suppose “re-acquired” might be more accurate here. For starters, the current iteration of Atari stems from Infogrames. In late 2000, Infogrames acquired Hasbro Interactive, who were then the hol…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insert pun about going fast here
Sonic the Hedgehog made his LEGO debut in 2016 as a Level Pack for LEGO Dimensions. As the first official LEGO Sonic set, it included a minifigure of the blue blur, as well as a miniature replication of Tails' Tornado biplane and the Sonic Speedster, modeled after Sonic's car from his racing sub-series.
Sadly, LEGO Dimensions didn't stick around. But that wasn't the end of Sonic's collaboration with the LEGO brand. Last year marked the debut of the LEGO Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone set. While LEGO Ideas sets are generally a one-time thing, Sonic will be sticking around for a bit as he's set to receive four new sets later this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfHq1GznyKI
If that trailer piqued your interest, the first four sets of the Sonic the Hedgehog line are:
Sonic's Speed Sphere Challenge (76990)
Tails' Workshop and Tornado Plane (76991)
Amy's Animal Rescue Island (76992)
Sonic's Green Hill Zone Loop Challenge (76994)
Hopefully, this series ends up as popular as the other LEGO video game lines (Minecraft, Super Mario, Overwatch) because I'd love to see more characters from the series as minifigures for me to collect. Rogue the Bat and Cream the Rabbit? Yes, please! And who wouldn't want a Knuckles set, especially with his solo series for Paramount+ going into production?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me.
It’s a shame that League of Legends has become such a meme for being a source of toxicity, as Riot Games has consistently shown that the world of Runeterra has quite a bit more potential than the MOBA lets on. Through its Riot Forge publishing arm, the company has enlisted several indie developers to make a diverse lineup of games spanning multiple genres to spotlight its lineup of champions, leading to the creation of great releases like Ruined King and Hextech Mayhem. Now, Digital Sun—the creators of Moonlighter—has been given a crack at the IP with The Mageseeker, and we’re pleased to report that it provides yet another deeply enjoyable take on the world of Runeterra.
The Mageseeker primarily follows characters in the nation of Demacia. Demacia is a prim, proud, and powerful kingdom that arose from the ashes of a global magical war, but that war led to a deep-rooted hatred and fear for all things magic. Out of this fear, the aristocracy formed the Mageseekers, a secret police organization designed to systematically hunt down all natural-born mages within the kingdom and either imprison or kill them.

Here are a few of my selections from the sale:
Hades for $12.49 - this is a no-brainer if you want to jump in and see what the hype is all about
Dead Cells: Medley of Pain Bundle for $31.99 - Dead Cells has been in the collective gaming consciousness for a while, and this bundle sets you up with four DLCs, including the Castlevania one

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due on April 25
In case you missed it (and it was easy to miss!), Nintendo shadow-dropped a trailer and release date for the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 story DLC. Truth be told I expected this thing to arrive in Q3 or Q4 of this year, but, uh, it's out on April 25!
Following the core reveal, the Nintendo of America YouTube channel also gave us a new song from the DLC, and it's a banger. The track is called "New Battle!!!" (make sure you get those three exclamation marks in there), and I can't wait to listen to it over and over in-game. Suddenly, the massive string of emotional JRPGs I played from the '90s through the early aughts came rushing back to me. I love how much Xenoblade Chronicles just does that on a regular basis, dating back to the release of the original on the Wii.
With each and every release the Xenoblade name continues to be out there, and I hope that when the next inevitable entry drops, it's an even bigger success. Also, timing! This DLC got in right before Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which is going to be dominating the collecting gaming conversation come mid-May. Until then we have Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to talk about.

Sometimes you're presented with a skill check and if one of your stats isn't an arbitrary number like, I dunno, seven, then whoever it is you spoke with (a king, a bard, an elf) might shutter their mouths forever.
Betrayal At Club Low is a CRPG that we're playing for our Game Club this month, and which understands the unpredictability of a face-to-face wobble of the lips, and how befriending or swindling or aggravating someone is determined by so much more than a single seven. And when all seems lost, how visiting a puddle can turn your entire evening around.

While the Walking Wake and Iron Leaves raids in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet were supposed to be a big event for everyone, some players were left holding...an egg.

Thankfully, update 1.3.0 fixes that, amid some other bugs.
Link Battles were a big focus in this patch, as were general battles involving a select few abilities (like Cud Chew) and Zoroark.

The story seemed straightforward; 1fichier refused to take pirated content down so the court found it liable for €442K in damages. With 1fichier set to file an appeal, TorrentFreak is informed that Nintendo had been offered tools to instantly take down all pirated content at zero cost.

Ahead of the launch of Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed on April 25th, 2023, Nintendo has unleashed a new track from the expansion called 'New Battle!!!'.
The music is, according to Nintendo, just one of the new battle themes you can expect to enjoy in the new story, and it's certainly got some serious Persona vibes, right? You might recognise the theme already, of course, since a portion of it was used in the announcement trailer just yesterday.

Perhaps the most notable update is a fix for trainers who caught an egg instead of Walking Wake or Iron Leaves in a Tera Raid Battle before updating to Version 1.2.0. It's mentioned how the Tera Raid Battle events for these two Pokémon are returning, so if you missed out the first time, there's no need to worry.

A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat.

Gameplay involves hiring thugs, sending them out to do crime, and then laundering the goods through your restaurant establishment. Don Duality looks like a simple little game, but I loved the crime/restaurant angle present in the Pizza Connection games.
I know I lost a few of you when I said deckbuilder. Personally, I’ve found myself enjoying the genre the more I explore it. Mahokenshi was perhaps the first time I really felt engaged with the mechanics, but there are many more that I’ve experienced since then that I’ve connected with. I feel that it allows for an easily understood abstraction of random mechanics. However, I can understand that it can be a bit vexing to anyone who hates being shown exactly how bad their luck is, as well as anyone who hates mechanics that involve things outside their direct control.
Nonetheless, you’ll get your chance to see if Don Duality is for your tastes before dropping money on it. Don Duality: Initiation will release on PC on April 21, 2023. The release for the full game is a little less clear and will likely depend on feedback.

Nintendo aired a new Indie World Showcase today, spotlighting what's to come for independent games on the Switch. Clocking in at roughly 20 minutes, it's a neat little look at what indies have in store amid the coming months.
Really, it was a strange show. The games shown were neat, but this showcase felt a little slim when it came to firm updates. Several projects popped up that we've known about, and a lot of windows were confirmed, but there was less in the way of hard dates.
Still, there were some surprises, as always. And even a few "out later today" appearances, which are always a highlight. I'll also just pre-emptively say this now: sorry Silksong sickos, but no news.

Well, it's been a long time coming, but we finally have an official release date for Team Reptile's Bomb Rush Cyberfunk as today's Indie World Direct showcase revealed that the game will skate over to Switch on 18th August.
We have been feeling the Jet Set Radio vibes of this project since it first boogied its way onto the scene back in 2020. After being officially delayed last year, we had accepted that it was going to be a little while before we heard any more news about these funky beats, but a brief snippet in the Indie World's closing sizzle reel confirmed that the game will be coming our way this summer.

Premium merchandise makers First 4 Figures have opened pre-orders on two princely statues, depicting the likenesses of the iconic knights Siegward of Catarina and Siegmeyer of Catarina, as featured in FromSoftware's acclaimed fantasy adventure Dark Souls 3.
Cast in resin and standing a little over eight inches in height, the two statues feature stylized, chibi takes on the Catarinian nobles, known to players as the "Onion Knights" due to their bulbous helmets. The two statues see Siegward and Siegmeyer in personality-reflective poses, and feature fine detailing to their armor and bases, with atmospheric elements of dirt, grime, and battle damage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoWP-p2BOII&ab_channel=First4Figures
While undeniably delightful pieces, that would fit snugly into the guardhouse of the most dedicated Dark Souls fan — the added security of having the Onion Knights in your home comes at a cost. Each statue retails for a princely £250 GBP (or roughly $300 USD), and thus customers are looking at around £500 for the pair, not including shipping charges. You can check out both Siegward and Siegmeyer over on the official First 4 Figures website, where various staggered payment options are also available.
The Dark Souls Siegward and Siegmeyer statues are expected to ship from First 4 Figures in the first quarter of 2024.

The short but sweet Nintendo Indie World Showcase gave us a deeper look at a small selection of Indie titles. Titles like Rift of the NecroDancer and the Dunkey-published Animal Well were featured, but neither received specific release dates. This makes it incredibly humorous that one of the most anticipated Indie titles of the year did get a confirmed release date… as part of the ending montage.
That’s right, if you kept your eyes glued to the end, you might have seen Bomb Rush Cyberfunk get a brief shoutout. Except instead of showing a “Q3” release date, the launch was confirmed for August 18, 2023. I have absolutely zero idea why Bomb Rush Cyberfunk didn’t warrant a prominent feature during the Direct with this information. Everything shown looked good, but this is news, dang it. Confirmation that we’ll get to play it this August is a big deal!
Making the situation even more humorous, Team Reptile uploaded a new trailer for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk following the Indie showcase. This would have been a perfectly exciting way to end the stream, but at least we have the footage now to enjoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAwGzZ-x3H0
Quibbles about the handling of the announcement aside, I'm glad to see a release date nailed down here. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk immediately turned heads with its Jet Set Radio influence, which we happen to like a lot around here. Considering the Indie in question already faced a delay, hard confirmation shows the game’s development is right on track. I can't wait to try this title, especially if the final product lives up to the footage we’ve seen.
Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will release on PC, Mac, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch.

In this Crypt of the NecroDancer spin-off, Cadence is now fighting to the beat of the rhythm in modern times. And during the Indie World, we got a good look at the lane-based combat that we'll need to get to grips with to shred our opponents.

A spooky summertime adventure is in store for July. Night School Studio's Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is scheduled to launch on July 12, 2023.
The follow-up to 2016's Oxenfree sees protagonist Riley Poverly return to her hometown in Camena. As a newly hired research assistant, she's investigating the local phenomena that's been interfering with electronics and radios. Her job is to set up radio transmitters around certain areas and report the data. Should be easy, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7AJBSII0Q8
Well, get a cult and some spirits involved, and you've got a long night ahead. Much like the first Oxenfree, choices will shape your story and future, as you deal with the strange oddities creating all these disturbances. As shown in a trailer during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase, things may not always go as planned.
All the outs in free
Oxenfree II sees Night School returning to the spooky 2016 adventure, following 2019's partying romp through the underworld in Afterparty and a few other projects.
Meanwhile, it's also Night School's newest project under Netflix, as the studio was acquired by the streaming giant in 2021. It's nice to see that the acquisition didn't cancel the studio's plans for a sequel at the time.
It's exciting to see Oxenfree II get a date locked in, and to have it during the summer too. Sure, the original was released in January 2016, but it's a distinctly "summer" game to me. It's about a bunch of angsty, worrying teens on their final summer vacation, and absolutely worth your time ahead of the sequel's launch. And with a July launch, the sequel is also thankfully avoiding the traffic jam of games in June.
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals hits Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, PC via Steam, and the Netflix platform on July 12, 2023.

As part of the Nintendo Indie World stream, Modus Games has announced that Rain Games' anticipated Teslagrad 2 is out now on all platforms!
By "now," I mean, "later today."
https://youtu.be/LnWJCg2XDMk
And that's not all. Alongside it is Teslagrad Remastered, an upgraded version of the 2013 indie title. It features improved visuals and ten extra challenge levels. Rain Games says they have taken a "light-touch" approach to the remaster, so don't expect any drastic changes.
Teslagrad 2 was first announced back in 2020. Like the original, it's a physics-based puzzle-platformer centered around electromagnetism. It's a Metroidvania set in a Scandinavian-inspired world. "Scandivania" is the word they've cleverly coined to describe it. The sequel boasts an expanded world and visual storytelling without the use of text or voice.
I never played the first Teslagrad because, at that point, we had just been swamped by puzzle-platformers in the wake of games like Trine. However, it's been some time since the heyday of XBLA, so I might be interested in trying it out now.
Despite being part of Nintendo's Indie World stream, both Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered will be available today on all the platforms it was announced for. That's PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.

That's because four of them are available later today: Teslagrad Remastered, its sequel Teslagrad 2, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, and a new game in the West of Loathing series called Shadows Over Loathing. 
Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market.

Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

Last year, Epic Games made a big investment in Aquiris, the Brazilian developer of Horizon Chase Turbo. Today, they have announced that they’ve followed through, acquired the studio, and rebranded it as Epic Brasil. That would be fine, but the developer is now mostly working on Fortnite content.
It feels like the entire industry is on a slow collapse into a Fortnite singularity. Not, like, actually, but it’s an amusing and horrifying thought.
Beyond the Horizon Chase series, Aquiris has been largely a mobile developer. Some of their more notable titles include Wonderbox and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem. Last year, they released Horizon Chase 2 on mobile platforms, with PC and console ports planned for this year.
An additional Fortnite support studio is only one function of the new Epic Brasil. They also state that this is to establish a presence in South America and “spotlight” the region’s developers.
“With the creation of Epic Games Brasil, we look forward to tapping into the immense talent the region has to offer and establishing our presence in Latin America,” said Alain Tascan, Executive Vice President of Game Development at Epic Games in the press release.
In the interim, Epic Brasil will still continue to work on supporting the titles it did as Aquiris. However, the press release is pretty clear, saying, “the AQUIRIS team of developers will join Epic Games to create groundbreaking content and social experiences within Fortnite.” There is no word on whether or not this will affect the PC and console port of Horizon Chase 2.

I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

Understandably, given Cammy's espionage expertise and devotion to all things Black Ops, "OverTrip" is a little subtler than most of the roster's themes, with a definitive "undercover operation" vibe befitting the top-tier agent. The electronically charged theme conjures up images of stealing through enemy territory, surveilling from dark alleyways, and ascertaining hidden info from server mainfr…]]></summary>

Few series are as beloved as Final Fantasy, and given how many re-releases, remakes, and remasters we’ve gotten over the years, Square Enix knows this. Often these remakes and re-releases have questionable quality and design choices that diehard fans lament. Enter the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster, which bundles the first six games into one convenient, streamlined package (or you can buy them individually) with respect for the original versions from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System at the forefront.
Originally released separately on Steam and mobile between July 2021 and February 2022, these versions include updated pixel graphics – hence the name – and rearranged orchestral scores, along with gameplay balances aplenty. For the most part, the collection maintains respect for the old while introducing a few extra bells and whistles for the console releases which will help introduce these classics to newcomers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

Developer Panic has revealed that Playdate, the curious handheld console powered by a physical crank, has sold over 53,000 units since its release exactly one year ago. This number, as noted by Eurogamer, represents double Panic's forecast for the admittedly niche, but intriguing device.
Announced back in 2019, Playdate was pitched as a hand-cranked portable console that would play a library of titles, released on rotational/seasonal basis. Interest quickly spread about the quirky platform, which lead to pre-orders selling out in a scant 20 minutes, as interested parties snapped up one of the initial 20,000 planned production models. To date, over 27,000 Playdate consoles have been shipped to their owners, with the team at Panic working hard to fulfill the surprising demand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdF3CnFvxg4&ab_channel=Panic
"To have now sold more than 53,000 (and counting) is heartening," said Panic in an anniversary statement. "And this, at a time when parts shortages forced our delivery lead-times out as much as a year. As those lead times shorten and Playdate delivery becomes more immediate, we’re looking forward to an even better Year Two."
Playdate is currently available to pre-order over on the official website, priced at $199 USD. Due to demand, shipping of new orders is not expected until the latter months of 2023, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lamplighters League is the next turn-based strategy game from the team behind Battletech and Shadowrun, but it’s also the name of the ragtag group of scoundrels you’ll be fighting with across this pulp adventure. Katharine got to see three of those characters in action during her preview - where she walked away very excited about the game’s emergent chaos - and now developer Harebrained Schemes have revealed all ten playable agents. Oh boy, do they look stylish.

I am but a humble video boy! My only job is to cut out the big "ums" from the audio mix, not writing words about the things we did a chat about! Thankfully this week Indiescovery is all about change, as we're experimenting with a brand new format. A group review! We've all been playing Dredge, the eldritch fishing adventure by Black Salt Games, and hoo boy do we have some thoughts about it. Spoilers: much like Katharine, we all think it's really really good.


Elsewhere, the review bonanza continues. Rachel's been rewriting fiction in Storyteller, I've been reclaiming the wasteland in Terra Nil and Rebecca has been dating hot monsters in Romancelvania. We also chat about burgers, olives and our current hyperfixations because hey, this is an episode of Indiescovery after all.

First up is the Sega Mega Drive port of Capcom's Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition. Released over a year after the SNES port had dominated the market, Sega's take on the biggest game of the day was a fair port of the coin-op classic, and necessitated the development of the Sega Mega Drive six-button controller for anybody who wanted to play the fighter with any degree of compatibility.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has cemented itself as one of the greatest RPGs ever created. With its outstanding score, excellent battle system, memorable characters, and impactful story, it honestly feels like the summation of everything Monolith Soft has been working toward with this series. If you enjoyed the game, you probably picked up the Expansion Pass DLC already. Arriving way ahead of schedule for that DLC is Wave 4, the final wave of new content for the game. As promised, Wave 4 includes a new story scenario dubbed Future Redeemed.
If you've been waiting a while for this DLC to arrive, you won't have to wait much longer to play it because Nintendo is dropping Future Redeemed next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFlf_S5Woug
That's not the only bit of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 news Nintendo announced tonight. It confirmed the Pyra and Mytha Super Smash Bros. amiibo double-pack will launch on July 21, 2023. If you use these amiibo with XC3, you'll unlock two unique Aegis Sword weapon skins for the Swordfighter class.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648498494133641217
If you choose not to pick up the amiibo, Nintendo confirmed the Aegis Sword skins will be unlockable within the game following a future patch. If you are still an amiibo fan, know that two more Xenoblade Chronicle 3 amiibo figures are on the way for Noah and Mio.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648500990788915200
More information about the Noah and Mio amiibo figures will be released at a future date. In the meantime, you can enjoy a new chapter in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 when Future Redeemed releases on April 25, 2023. Future Redeemed is part of the XC3 Expansion Pass, which is available for $29.99.

The rerelease of Pokemon Stadium via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack has been a mixed bag. On one hand, it’s great to see a spinoff like Pokemon Stadium see the light of day again. Interest in competitive Pokemon battling has taken off exponentially since 2000, so Stadium in many ways feels more relevant today than it was at launch.
On the other hand, the greatest feature of Pokemon Stadium was its integration with Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow via the N64 Transfer Pak. The Switch release of Pokemon Stadium sorely lacks this, forcing players to use rental Pokemon with… less than ideal movesets. Pokemon like Alakazam that are otherwise very good in Generation 1 are rendered practically useless due to rental movesets. Beating Pokemon Stadium wit…]]></summary>

The Diablo IV open beta weekends came and went in back in March, giving players a little bit of time with the upcoming dungeon crawler. Blizzard also used the occasion to test out its new game a bit, and has detailed some of the changes its making based on feedback from the early Diablo IV play periods, ahead of the full launch in June.
In a blog titled "Diablo IV Open Beta Retrospective, Transforming Feedback Into Change," Blizzard outlines some lessons learned from the March 17 and 24 weekends. These Early Access and Open Beta periods saw a fair few folks pop on and level up their characters. During that time, Blizzard solicited feedback on the official forums, as well as through forums like Reddit and Discord.

Dead Island 2 finally rises from the ashes this week, with plenty of zombies to slay in either solo or co-op. But if you're running on some older hardware, you'll need to be the one joining rather than making the party.
In a blog outlining Dead Island 2's co-op features, Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver clarify that certain consoles won't be able to host parties, only join them. These are, specifically, the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and the Xbox One S, or what they call "Base Generation 8."
Because Dead Island 2 co-op games are peer-to-peer, rather than server-based, this means a player will have to host the game. Dead Island 2's graphical requirements mean that, at launch, a base Gen8 console won't be able to handle hosting co-op, only join it…]]></summary>

In VR, gunplay is more realistic than ever, and developers have experimented with the genre to introduce new and innovative gameplay styles. Players looking for the best FPS games on PSVR 2 have a few titles to choose from. Some titles, like Pavlov, follow a traditional FPS structure while others, like <Runner>, add an innovative twist to things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long division
Ubisoft has announced that it will host a stream to cover what’s upcoming for The Division franchise on April 20. This is apparently “Division Day,” but I feel like most of their target audience knows that day as something else.
https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1648370815459643392?s=20
The festivities will kick off with a look at the year 5 roadmap for The Division 2, which includes some insight into its “Descent game mode.” I can’t believe The Division 2 has been out for five years. It paradoxically feels like a lot longer and far shorter. I mean, it feels like yesterday that people were complaining that they had to literally queue up to interact with NPCs, because the weird design choice was made to only allow one player to talk to them at a time. In an online game.
Next is a gameplay preview of the upcoming The Division Heartland, which is a free-to-play game in the series’ universe. There’s supposedly going to be an open beta ahead of launch, so maybe we’ll hear a little about that.
Finally, there will be a “project update” for The Division Resurgence, which is an upcoming free-to-play mobile entry in the series. Wait. Where are you going? Come back!
I haven’t really touched anything with Tom Clancy’s name on it since Ubisoft started using it to brand a bunch of multi-player stuff. The Division, in particular, sounds like the oil to my water, which is to say, I don’t think I could get into it. Maybe in my younger days.
The Division stream is set to kick off on April 20, 2023, at 11AM PDT/ 8PM CEST/ 2PM EDT. You’ll be able to view it on Ubisoft’s Twitch and Youtube channels.

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.
Which games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve and CodeWeavers have released the latest version of Proton, their compatibility software that allows Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems – like that of the Steam Deck. Proton 8.0 is a biggun, smoothing out compatibility issues for over a dozen games (including the Dead Space remake and Forspoken) while making Steam Deck-specific fixes to many more.
These include an update that should make the repeatedly troublesome 2K Launcher behave itself again, while Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gets improved sleep/resume functionality on the handheld PC. A crashing issue with LLife is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.
Downloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives on June 6, and that date now feels more concrete because Blizzard announced today that the game has gone gold. That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.
The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For hardware that’s all about searing speed, advances in SSD tech can be a Beckettian waiting game. Microsoft’s DirectStorage has only so far only found support in the ho-hum Forspoken, and PCIe 5.0 SSDs still aren’t widely available despite the first compatible CPUs and motherboards launching in 2021.
However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC. The short version: with maximum read and write speeds that tower over the current generation’s best SSDs, albeit with less impact on game load times than such explosive pace would suggest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shardpunk: Verminfall smooshes together a bunch of different ideas you'll have seen before. It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

The latest is Fabledom, which promises the pastoral fields and castle wall construction I adore, then adds a twist by being set within a fairytale kingdom. It's in early access now.

That thrill fades as complete more runs and reach the game's edges, but its DLCs are so far doing a good job of creating new, uncharted territory. The latest, Tides Of The Foscari, is out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're starting playing Ghostwire: Tokyo after it came to Game Pass this week, I have a hot tip for you: prioritise upgrading movement abilities. The freedom to glide from rooftop to rooftop over haunted Tokyo will bring you so much more joy than any incremental damage upgrade. That's the most important thing I have to say, that it makes for good virtuatourism.
Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

I had left weird abiogenesis idle clicker The Barnacle Goose Experiment running in the background for a few days, dithering a bit any time I stumbled back across the browser tab, until one day it hit me. I don't remember what it was, but one discovery was so strange and exciting that I then sat there for four hours, thinking "I'll go to bed when this result comes in", and then. Woof. I am now far too old to stay up past my bedtime playing video games, and am still tired. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd planned on starting with a line about how Loretta is an exception to how psychological horror games are about trudging around an abandoned mental hospital with the worst torch in the world until the girl from Ringu menaces you. It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbbiden West gets a big story expansion called Burning Shores next week, and the game’s launch trailer sets the table for Aloy’s dangerous excursion to the remains of Hollywood. 
First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles. The untamed area has become a seismically unstable, volcanic archipelago where a new menace and never-before-seen machines await Aloy, who's now joined by a mysterious new companion. 


Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC. 
Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores launches on April 19. You can read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

I mean, I barbecued some womb in a restaurant in Japan recently, and I can confirm that it was like calamari but tougher, and, largely, a lot worse. So, that's why the idea of Pringles releasing a limited-edition Minecraft Suspicious Stew flavour intrigues me! I would like to give it a go and see if it's actually quite nice or makes me barf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's brutal working culture isn't exactly a secret. You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

It's a challenging climb yet a curiously chill vibe, perhaps because any time I fall all the way down, I'm delighted to be back surrounded by overgrown plants and sculptures rising from a pond. The developer says Beton Brutal "tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft," and I think I have a lot to learn. I didn't even know Minecraft had parkour.

Frakenstein is often cited as the first science fiction thing, and now it can add to its honours because it's the inspiration for the first major update to V Rising. The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's in a month, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright.

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s taken a few GPUs, but Nvidia’s RTX 40 series is finally veering away from ludicrous luxuries and heading back in the right direction: that of graphics cards you can, and maybe even should buy, even if you’re not the heir to an Emirati property conglomerate. The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

The extra time will be spent “to better incorporate community feedback,” by improving the balancing, meta-progression, and onboarding, and giving the roguelike a few more layers of polish.

Alongside concerns that the system introduces a single "point of failure" that could undermine the security of national networks, ISPs believe they could be held liable when over-blocking enters the equation. More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

It's a somewhat selfish thing, admittedly.

Previously announced updates will still hit the game before September, such as patches improving animations and the Create mode, as well the Tren update. Events such as DreamsCom, Impy Awards, and All Hallows Dreams will no longer take place as well.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others.

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I’m always thinking about death,” Ikumi Nakamura tells me, as we ourselves are, in fact, confronted by death. It’s late at night. There are no cars, people, or sounds to distract me. I can’t avoid what I’m seeing: a host of creatures about to be murdered.
We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

After twenty years of development Dwarf Fortress finally made the jump to Steam in December 2021, complete with exciting new features such as "graphics" and "mouse support". Although the game was already critically lauded, its availability on Steam made it a financial success, with thousands of long-term fans thrilled to provide the brothers with a long-overdue payday. 


Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2012, Double Fine Productions launched a Kickstarter campaign to make an adventure game.
At the time, the idea was that the adventure genre was dead – at least in the eyes of major publishers. However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?
In Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development. On that last point, Double Fine wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230401/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
