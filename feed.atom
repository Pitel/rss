        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[505 Games have revealed a remake of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, the mournful 2013 fantasy adventure from Josef Fares and Starbreeze Studios. It's due for release on 28th February 2024, and here's the first trailer.
A Tale of Two Sons is notable for having a split control scheme - you steer each brother with a different analog stick, weaving their movements together to bypass obstacles and puzzles. It's also notable for being a sad 'un: your goal in the game is to find a remedy for your sick father, which involves a journey up a mountain to a magical tree.
"It may well look like a kids-friendly game, but be warned that things do get surprisingly dark in places, and you'd end up having some pretty difficult conversations with any little ones once it's over," John Walker (RPS in peace) wrote back in 2013. "These are adult themes, presented in a mature way, via the lives of two fantastic children. And it's well worth your time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're only a couple minutes into The Game Awards, and the World Premieres are already coming. Kicking off the show, a remake of 2013's Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was announced.


The trailer is certainly in the "teaser" territory more than anything. We see some prettier versions of locations from the original game, as well as some gameplay featuring the titular brothers. Honestly, it's been so long since I've even seen the original game that I can't really compare much from memory. The single player co-op game certainly made waves a decade ago, so we'll have to see if the remake has the same impact.




Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons: Remake (is that really the title?) will launch on February 28, 2024. Stay tuned as we learn more about this reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, the award-winning 2013 indie from developer Starbreeze Studios, is getting remade. Italy-based developer Avantgarden, the team behind 2017's Last Day Of June and formerly named Ovosonico, is handling the remake and building it in Unreal Engine 5. Original publisher 505 Games is publishing the remake, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28, as well. 
505 Games says original Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons director, Josef Fares, who later founded Hazelight Studios, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 for It Takes Two, has endorsed the remake. 
Check out the Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 
INSERT TRAILER 
"Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake faithfully re-tells the remarkable heart-rending journey of brothers Naia and Naiee as they embark on a quest to save the life of their dying father," a press release reads. "Built on the Unreal Engine 5, every step of the brothers' journey has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up for the most immersive story possible, whilst remaining faithful to the original game. 
"As an additional bonus, the classic single-player experience is now also joined by local co-op, allowing friends to each control a brother's actions." 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons won a BAFTA for Game Innovation, the Downloadable Game of the Year from the D.I.C.E and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and Best Xbox Game as the VGAs after its release. 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, the Epic Game Store, and GOG, on February 28, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequel to a sequel would be "a little bit wild".
If you're wondering what the chances are of a "direct sequel" to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, don't get your hopes up. During an interview with Game Informer, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was asked about the possibility and says Tears of the Kingdom has already exhausted all of the possibilities in this particular world.

"Well that would be a sequel to a sequel, which is getting a little bit wild when you think about it! But as I've mentioned previously, with Tears of the Kingdom, we were seeking to build on top of the world we created with Breath of the Wild and really exhaust the possibilities of what we could put into that world. I think it is – to use a bit of a term – an apotheosis, or the final form of that version of The Legend of Zelda. In that regard, I don't think that we'll be making a direct sequel to a world such as that that we've created."

The show kicks off at 7:30 p.m. ET / 4:30 p.m. PT, on channels like YouTube and Twitch. You can watch it in the embed below, or through one of the countless number of channels that will co-stream it elsewhere.




A big but difficult year for games


This is usually the part of the watch post where I speculate on what we'll see there. We've already seen confirmations that games like Atlus' Metaphor: ReFantazio will be in attendance, as will Timothée Chalamet and Gonzo. Because at this point, the Awards must have to contractually include a Muppet.

Destructoid’s own Steven “Axel Grease” Mills is currently on the case, but he reports that he can’t even get onto a server. However, Steam user Dr. Compton states, “Turns out it is a real game. Kind of wish it wasn’t.” Others report that The Day Before’s performance isn’t quite what it should be. Some state that the settings menus don’t quite work right. A few imply that it’s not really a survival game, but is actually an extraction shooter.

In addition to spawning countless viral social media posts about the creations of players, it also quickly became the fastest-selling Legend of Zelda title, as well one of the frontrunners for 2023's Game of the Year award. At the time of its launch, producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi didn't know what the community reaction would eventually become.
However, now more than a half year removed from the launch of Tears of the Kingdom, I once again caught up with Aonuma and Fujibayashi to break down some of the more discussed moments of Tears of the Kingdom and speak about the evolution of the series. You can read the full interview below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an enjoyer of PC games, the only thing that could possibly be better than a Steam Deck OLED is a free Steam Deck OLED. Or maybe money to buy all my wishlisted games. The Game Awards 2023 is offering up a chance to get Valve's new handheld via a giveaway that starts tonight.


The Game Awards 2023 kicks off today, December 7, at 7:30 pm EST. Once it starts, you can navigate over to the Steam Deck OLED giveaway page for a chance to get one for free. The Game Awards is also shelling out for the 1 TB version, not the 512 GB OLED, meaning you could potentially save yourself $649 to buy one yourself. The giveaway begins as the show starts, and will end at 11 pm EST tonight. Those chosen will get an email on Friday, December 8.





How to qualify for a free Steam Deck OLED during The Game Awards


The Game Awards is using a Gleam widget on the giveaway page with a countdown leading to the start of the show. To enter, you'll need to provide contact information such as your email address, name, and address. You're also required to have a Steam account. During the show, you'll have to follow the Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards accounts on X/Twitter. 


It looks like following all the steps will award four entries, which you can use during the giveaway. There are more rules, of course, and not every country qualifies. So be sure to check out the page ahead of time.


If you don't want a free Steam Deck OLED, The Game Awards has other giveaways. There are 100 Lenovo Legion Go handhelds on offer tonight. The AMD-powered rival handheld has an MSRP of $699.99 for the 512 GB model. Getting it potentially for free certainly sounds much more desirable. You may also win tickets for Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood.

The trailer came out earlier than expected due to an unfortunate leak. Regardless, the graphics and world made the 10-year wait for a new Grand Theft Auto worth it for fans. With that, we are returning to a familiar location: Vice City. However, it's just a small part of the bigger map of Leonida. 


Yes, you can probably tell it's a clear reference to the real-life Florida. The references to the state don't end at the name, as many crazy scenes in the trailer actually happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've collected video game delay notices like Christmas candy, and today I have one more to shove in the stocking. The Alone in the Dark remake has been delayed once more until early next year — but the reason should leave most feeling jolly.


The Alone in the Dark remake is moving from its (already delayed) January 2024 launch to later on March 20, 2024. Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Pieces Interactive sent out a notice for the delay. It wrote that the companies are pushing the game a bit longer in order to "avoid any potential crunch over the Christmas holidays."

Alone in the Dark delayed until March to prevent any holiday humbug


Frankly, I'm totally okay with this reasoning. Normally, I'm also perfectly fine with companies delaying for polish reasons. But allowing game developers to relax and sip hot cocoa during the holidays without the ghost of Christmas crunch looming overhead is a big win in my book. Of course, additional game polish is a goal with the delay. 


"THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive want to ensure that the game not only meets but exceeds the expectations of the community," THQ Nordic explained, "especially with the outstanding performances of Hollywood stars David and Jodie as the main protagonists."


The Alone in the Dark remake returns to the series' roots, mashing together psychological horror with "Southern Gothic" charm. It starts David Harbour and Jodie Comer as co-protagonists Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively. The story was penned by Mikael Hedberg of SOMA and Amnesia fame. A Guillermo del Toro collaborator, Guy Davis, is contributing monster designs.

So far, Alone in the Dark is looking promising. But then again, anything would appear significantly better than what the series has been dishing out for the last 15 years or so.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is celebrating its 5th anniversary today, 7th December 2023, and we're publishing a handful of pieces to celebrate. Here, we'll be discussing the future of the Smash series — what's next? Is there even a next? And where do we think Sakurai will be involved?

It's hard to believe that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is five years old. It's one of the defining games of the Nintendo Switch, and along with its incredible roster of characters, stages, music — basically everything — it's easily one of the best fighting games ever. At least, in our humble opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your wallets ready because the soon-to-be "Dearly Beloved" Sora amiibo is on its way. The latest Super Smash Bros. amiibo arrives on February 16. 


Pre-orders have started to pop up at retailers, though it already seems like folks are clamoring to get their own Sora. It will likely be available at usual retailers, though. Sora marks the last Super Smash Bros. character to get an amiibo.




Better summon your bank account for this Sora amiibo


The Sora amiibo clocks in at the standard $15.99 that other Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo have cost. If you aren't able to pre-order Sora, you'll likely have to face the wrath of the second-hand market. 


Just like the rest of the Smash Bros series, Sora takes on the same pose as his appearance in the character select screen in Ultimate. He's giving a big smile as he holds the keyblade over his shoulder. His attire is based on Sora's original costume from the first game. It's one of his best looks, but that might be my nostalgia talking.


The amiibo can be used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and will learn from your attacks as it levels up. You can use it in amiibo battles online and in regular Smash matches. It would be cool if it had some integration with Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory, but right now, there's no other usage announced.

Something else you should know about Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory


You may have forgotten this, but if you have a Melody of Memory save file on your Switch, you'll unlock a new song in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It's the "Dearly Beloved" theme from the rhythm game's main menu. It's an upbeat, jazzy take on the track that works well in battles within Ultimate.


This story has been updated to reflect pre-orders and pricing going live at some retailers.

There’s a lot to unpack in this four minute long trailer. It opens by returning to Area Zero, the namesake of the DLC bundle and the highlight of the core games. But rather than get into any plot details of what this abyss of Paradox Pokemon contains, we instead get a montage showing both returning gym leaders and new faces alike. Additionally, the trailer shows a lot of legendary Pokemon from previous generations. Like a lot. We got the legendary birds. We got the legendary dogs/cats/gerbils. There are even som…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/pc-engine-cd-rpg-tengai-makyou-ziria-get-fan-translated/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pc-engine-cd-rpg-tengai-makyou-ziria-get-fan-translated"/>
        <updated>2023-12-07T18:34:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an RPG you probably haven’t played before? Maybe check out Tengai Makyou: Zirai, a 1989 PC-Engine CD-ROM² game that just got a fan translation.


The TurboGrafx 16 was an impressive flop in North America. A console failing is interesting enough, but the fact that it was the localized production of a very popular Japanese console makes it even better. The PC-Engine was huge in Japan. It took a sizeable chunk of Nintendo’s market dominance and outdid the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America) overall. We only saw a small fraction of what the Japanese market got, especially when it comes to the CD attachments.


Tengai Makyou: Zirai is the first in the series, sometimes called Far East of Eden over here because that’s the name it was given on the occasions it came so close to being released Westward. Also, it’s subtitled on the disc and title screen. The series is a trilogy of RPGs that were remade a few times, as well as spin-offs covering other genres.

While I’m not intimately familiar with the series, according to the developers behind the translation, the series is “an elaborate joke based around foreigners' misperceptions of Japan.” Tengai Makyou: Zirai is a somewhat humorous warping of Japanese folklore. It doesn’t seem to be on the same level as Ganbare Goemon, but it’s not entirely straight-faced, either.


Being on a CD platform, there’s voice acting, cutscenes, and more elaborate animations. More importantly, it kicked off a popular RPG series that we didn’t really see much of over here in the West. 


The translation of Tengai Makyou: Zirai is the work of user Supper and TheMajinZenki and can be found over here. If you want more, 1995’s Tengai Makyou Zero on the Super Famicom received a fan translation back in 2017.

It's been a long time since we've heard anything about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance port on Nintendo Switch. But today, in a surprise announcement, publisher Plaion has shared an update with us: the port of the 2018 title will be coming to the Switch in early 2024. At last!
The Switch port is being worked on by Saber Interactive, the same team that helped bring The Witcher III: Wild Hunt to the hybrid console, which inspires some faith. But when the game originally launched on PS4, Xbox One, and PC back in 2018, there were some criticisms about performance and bugs — whether those have been fixed and will be absent from the Switch version remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been over two years since it was announced that the 2018 medieval RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance would be launching on Switch. That silence has finally been broken with the news that the Nintendo port is arriving sometime next year.
The Switch version comes in the form of Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Royal Edition. The port is being handled by Saber Interactive (Warhorse Studios is the original developer) and bundles the base game with all released DLC. It will be available both digitally and physically. There's no new trailer showcasing how the game runs on Switch, but Saber did release a few screenshots of the port. 

Kingdom Come: Deliverance first arrived in February 2018 and stars Henry, the son of a blacksmith who embarks on a quest to fight against invaders to avenge the death of his parents and the destruction of his village. The game is best known for its demanding, realistic gameplay, which has earned it a cult following of dedicated fans while polarizing others.

But with the Indigo Disk DLC around the corner, it appears Game Freak is hyping up the end of Generation 9. Fittingly, trainers can grab Dialga and Palkia in this month's next Tera Raid event.


As many Pokemon fans know, Dialga and Palkia are the cover legendary Pokemon for Pokemon Diamond & Pearl. Perhaps newer fans know these monsters from the more recent Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but we don’t talk about those games. Either way, these are proper legendary monsters with crazy stats and powerful moves, so they’re well worth grabbing.

Fortunately, you shouldn’t need an optimal team to take on these monsters. Dialga and Palkia will a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam hardware survey has shown that previous Nvidia graphics cards are still very much in vogue when it comes to PC gaming. However, one of the lower-end 3000 series may be getting pushed aside to make room for a GPU that could be, inexplicably, worse.


According to a report from Videocardz – which references the Chinese website Board Channels – Nvidia may be replacing its RTX 3050 card in favor of a similar one, but with less memory. It's been suggested that Team Green could opt to manufacture and sell a 3050 with 6GB of RAM instead of the 8GB it currently has.


Image via Nvidia.


Quite why this would be the case is not clear, but the report suggests it may be down to this older GPU "impacting sales of the RTX 4060 too much." If the 3050 does get replaced with a lower spec version, it could be on the market by January, according to a Board Channels quote translated by Videocardz.


The usual tempering of expectations is recommended


As always with these things, it's best to take the information at face value for now. Until Nvidia confirms or denies these speculations, we have to assume that's what they are: just speculations.


It's believed that the RTX 3050 6GB card will still use the GA106 chip, but have a TDP of 75W. The current model has a TDP of 130W, so it's possible the rest of the hardware configurations will have a bit of a downgrade as well.


As I say, these details have yet to be confirmed so take them with a pinch of salt. Whatever reason Nvidia has for discontinuing an Ampere GPU and replacing it with a weaker model, it's best to hold off judgement until someone from the company addresses it. At the time of writing, Team Green has yet to comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive Monster is very slowly lifting the curtain of their upcoming Cult of the Lamb DLC, Sins of the Flesh. They will be showing off a teaser of the expansion every week until December 25. So we got one today (the 7th), which means we’re going to get (checks calendar) two more.


The gif animation we got today depicts the nudist ritual. Here you go, look at it.


Image via Massive Monster


That’s all we’ve got. That is the new “all we know” about Sins of the Flesh.


Actually, no, not quite. On November 28, 2023, the Cult of the Lamb Twitter announced that if they passed the 300K follower mark, they would add sex into the game. They almost immediately gained an additional 100K followers, putting them well over the mark.


That means sex, right? Speaking to Polygon, the developers said, “We used games like Pokémon and The Sims when it comes to references, but put our own cult-ish spin on things. The age rating will not change.” So, that means, suggested sex, right? Like WooHoo from The Sims?


Yes! Maybe! Probably somewhat. Or possibly not at all…


Posting on Steam Discussions (you owe me for delving into that cesspool), one of the developers states, “Hello! Here to soothe some worries. 'Sex Update' has become a bit of a meme in the community, one that a lot are really running with! But we have made sure all the new content (which is much more than what the keyart suggests) adheres to guidelines so the age rating should not change.”


So, what’s indicated here is that there will be some reference to sex, but you’ll probably still be able to play the incredibly family-friendly Cult of the Lamb in front of your mom. Unless the developers are just straight-up trolling us. It could be both! It’s probably both!


Cult of the Lamb is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Sins of the Flesh update is scheduled for early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in 2022 – read Game Informer's review here – developer Game Freak revealed that the ninth generation of Pokémon would be getting two DLC expansions, just like Pokémon Sword and Shield did. The first installment was called The Teal Mask and it hit Switch on September 13. The second expansion, The Indigo Disk, hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet next week, on December 14, and to celebrate its arrival, Game Freak and Nintendo released a four-minute trailer today showcasing some of the DLC's highlights. 
In it, we see plenty of starter Pokémon – every starter is returning in The Indigo Disk – and various legendaries, too, like the Johto dogs, the Hoenn legendaries, and much more. We also get a taste of Blueberry Academy, its special Blueberry Quests, unique Pokémon-centric minigames, and a dose of tough double battles against various trainers at the school. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the trailer, we also learn of some special upcoming events players can participate in. Until December 21, players can challenge Dialga and Palkia in Tera Raid Battles, and they can collect Darkrai via Mystery Gift, too. Players also have until January 3 to obtain a Master Ball and shiny Lucario via Mystery Gift, and they can take part in three Mass Outbreak events until December 21. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of Christmas, you probably don't think of Morrowind. And why would you? With its fantasy folklore and cursed Ashlands, it's not a fictional universe ripe for December joy. But that doesn't mean you can't be an outlander and not get into the spirit of the season.


To get all of us in the mood for the holidays, Nexus Mods user Danae123 has created an in-game advent calendar for Morrowind. Consisting of one gift per day, it gives you the chance to have a little festive joy up to December 24.


Image via Danae123/Nexus Mods.


Yes, I'm aware that we're now seven days into the month. That's on me for not spotting this sooner. But you can still claim a gift-a-day from a secret cabin for the rest of the time period.


Candy canes and moon sugar


For obvious reasons, Danae123 doesn't say what the advent gifts are each day. You wouldn't want to spoil the surprise now, would you?


As for how you can collect your presents, when asked on the mod page, a user was told that it's a "vanilla cabin on Solstheim that you are sent to during the Moon Sugar Mystery quest." Given this, you'll need to make sure you have the Bloodmoon expansion installed at the very least, as this is the only way to get access to the Morrowind island.


While many are still playing Skyrim, it's nice to see that the classic Elder Scrolls games are still getting some love. They might not officially celebrate Christmas on the Dunmer island of Vvardenfell, but that shouldn't stop you from wearing a Christmas smile as you slash through Nix Hounds and bandits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days in and the GTA 6 trailer is nearly at 120 million views on YouTube. It's become one of the most-watched video game trailers in history, but it's not just benefitting Rockstar. It's also seeing a revival of a music legend.


According to data sent to the BBC by Spotify, the recent GTA 6 reveal has seen interest in the late rock musician Tom Petty soar, thanks to his song "Love Is A Long Road" being featured in the teaser. Streams for the track – first released in 1989 – have increased by 36,979%.




Yes, I had to do a double take as well, because that's a comma, not a period. Nearly a 37,000% uptick in one song's popularity is insane, but given the hype around the upcoming Grand Theft Auto entry, it's perhaps not too surprising.


Rock never dies


After ten years of waiting, Rockstar finally gave us a taste of things to come in GTA 6. Sadly, we still have a bit longer to wait until it releases, as it's only due to come out in 2025. We don't even have an exact date. All we know is it'll be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. No word on when PC will get it, though.


With Tom Petty's song being given a new lease on life, it calls into question what other tracks will be in the game itself. As a series, Grand Theft Auto is known for its soundtrack, featuring a slew of classics from many artists and bands. 


On a personal note: it absolutely blew my mind when I first heard Slayer's "Raining Blood" on Vice City's V-Rock station. Ah, good times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta scout 'em all.
While Pokémon has long been the undisputed king of the monster-catching RPG niche, there have always been other releases that have offered up their own distinct take on that unique brand of recruitment gameplay. Megami Tensei, for example, pioneered the concept with ‘Demon Negotiation’ in 1987 and Dragon Quest took a crack at it with monster recruitment in Dragon Quest V in 1992, before expanding it into a sub-series with Dragon Quest Monsters in 1998.
Though it always had its fans, Dragon Quest Monsters never quite found its feet in the West, and its popularity started to peter out even across its small handful of Japan-only releases in the last decade. After several years of letting the franchise cool, Square has now decided to bring the series back with Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. While it may not quite be the roaring revival that longtime fans hoped it would be, this new release is nonetheless a fun and engaging new entry that we’d suggest you consider picking up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September, Nintendo revealed that the Kingdom Hearts "Sora" Amiibo for the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate line was coming sometime next year. Now, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 16, 2024. 
Nintendo revealed the release date late last night, on December 6, with a short video on Twitter showcasing the Amiibo. As expected, it adopts the look of Sora in the first Kingdom Hearts – a fan-favorite – with his trademark smile and keyblade hoisted over the shoulder. 
Check out the Sora Amiibo teaser for yourself below: 
The #SmashBros #amiibo of Sora will be released on 2/16/2024! #KingdomHearts pic.twitter.com/y3zdbaLplz
December 7, 2023
Sora is the last fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to get an Amiibo, meaning in February, players can finally complete their Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Amiibo lineup. Right before Sora, though, Nintendo will release the Noah and Mio Amiibo from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on January 19, 2024. Just last month, Nintendo released the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. 
For more, read Game Informer's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then check out the reveal trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4. Read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts 4 after that.

This is indeed an extremely Ubisoft game, with all the busywork and go-here-shoot-that roteness that entails, and although it throws some genuinely gorgeous visuals into the bargain, these also come at the cost of steep hardware requirements.
That said, good performance ain’t out of the question, at least not for modern CPUs and graphics cards. It will just take some digging through the graphics menus – digging that I’ve now completed, so join me as my blackened fingers bash out a convenient guide to Frontiers of Pandora’s PC performance and best settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see you, Gleeok.
Much like its immediate predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is seemingly crammed full of glitches; if you know how to trigger them, that is. The latest lets you view the world via a first-person perspective at any given moment.
As discovered by Gaming Reinvented, the glitch is admittedly a bit of a faff to pull off, so we're not going to list out every step required here, but be sure to watch the video carefully if you'd like to try it out yourself. Needless to say, you'll need to get started with the 'Hold Storage' glitch, so if you're already familiar with this, then you're on the right track.

The Gold Master Series officially started with The Making of Karateka, but the format was first piloted for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. Rather than just being collections, the titles are interactive documentaries built around the games they contain. In this way, greater context and, therefore, a greater appreciation can be formed for the subjects.




Jeff Minter is a veteran of game design. He began his career in the early 1980’s, developing games for 8-bit microcomputers like the Sinclair ZX81 and the Commodore Vic-20. A lot of his early games were clones of popular arcade titles, which w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what is an odd and pretty funny surprise, Vampire Survivors is getting an Among Us-themed DLC. Titled Emergency Meeting, the DLC sees the survivors teaming up with the Among Us crewmates and fighting alien hordes.


While Among Us is no stranger to crossovers, especially with other indie titles, Emergency Meeting marks Vampire Survivors' first crossover DLC. It's expansive too, adding eight playable characters, 15 weapons, and a new stage called Polus Replica.


As with the base game and other paid DLCs, Emergency Meeting is pretty affordable at $2.50. Fans won't have to wait long to play it either as it comes out on December 18 for PC and Xbox Series consoles. 




Alongside the blog post announcing the DLC, a trailer went live on poncle's YouTube page. It's pretty amazing, as several Vampire Survivors characters are transported to space and meet the Among Us cast. What ensures is a team-up to fend off thousands of angry aliens with planet-destroying powers.


It only slightly exaggerates the gameplay loop in Vampire Survivors, but it exemplifies the power trip that begins when equipped with all possible upgrades in a run. Honestly, I would have been happy with the crossover being just the trailer. An entire DLC paired with it is just the icing on the cake.


As unexpected as this crossover is, it looks like an absolute blast. This alongside patch 1.8 adding the narrative-based Adventures mode means Vampire Survivors fans are getting a significant amount of new content to chew through.

A new report from IGN's Rebekah Valentine alleges that the situation only worsens for the remaining employees at Bungie. Morale and company culture seem like they're taking a backseat, in order to avoid something as drastic as a complete Sony takeover.


Following Bungie's layoffs at the end of October, reports surfaced that the studio was drastically missing revenue targets. A Bloomberg report claimed the company would delay Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion in addition to the upcoming new title Marathon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Wholesome Snack Showcase, Happy Broccoli Games has revealed their investigative adventure, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami. It will be coming to PC sometime in 2024.


Happy Broccoli Games has stated that Duck Detective: The Secret Salami is a 90-minute detective game, and that sounds perfect. It’s inspired by Return to the Obra Dinn and The Case of the Golden Idol, and has you, the eponymous duck, gathering clues, interviewing suspects, and putting the pieces together to find out who did the crime. What crime? Something to do with sausages. 




That’s about all we’re told. It takes place in an office, so I assume someone ate their co-worker’s lunch. I cannot imagine ever doing that. I can’t imagine the kind of person who would. And yet, it happens. That’s so weird and maliciously inconsiderate. Who raised these people?


I like the sudden surge of detective games in the indie and alternative markets. It has gotten to the point where I can’t keep up with them, but most of the ones I’ve played have been really enjoyable. They make me feel smart, even if I’m just painting by numbers.


I also like seeing a game advertise its short length. Often, we get too caught up on time spent per dollar, but I don’t want to live in a world where every game is 60 hours. Some of them? Yes. But not all. I’d like to pick one up for afternoon entertainment. Such as Dangeresque The Roomisode Triungulate, which is also roughly 90 minutes. It’s great! There's no reason for me to not play this game. Even if I don't enjoy it, what have I lost? I spend more time a day killing my brain with Social Media.


Duck Detective: The Secret Salami is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've had enough of the rough and tumble adventure of Eastward, it's time to take a step back with the upcoming Octopia DLC. This one trades in a collapsing society for one full of fruitful farming fun, and developer Pixpil and publisher Chucklefish have it lined up for a January 31, 2024 launch. 


To shake the tribulation of Eastward, Pixpil set Octopia in a parallel world that is, to say the least, a lot more chill. This time around Sam and John get to bask in that sweet farming life in the countryside as they build up an old farmstead, grow crops, cook with neighbors, and attract more eager new folks to the town of Octopia. 


You can settle in yourself with the release date trailer:




The meticulous pixel art for which Eastward is known is one bond that this world and the other have in common. While Octopia is being released as DLC for Eastward, you don't have to complete the game to gain access. As long as you have a copy of Eastward you'll be able to venture to Octopia right from the main menu. Sam and John's peaceful new life will be available on Nintendo Switch and Steam for $5.99.


Eastward first launched in September 2021, delivering a journey adorned with gorgeous art and a soundtrack we won't soon forget. There's plenty of competition out there for farming sim games with nostalgic vibes, so we'll see how this one fits in early next year.

        <updated>2023-12-06T19:46:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open Roads, the narrative adventure game starring Keri Russell (The Americans, Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), finally has a release date, nearly three years after its initial reveal at The Game Awards 2020. It hits consoles and PC on February 22, 2024. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive announced this release date today with a new trailer that features Russell talking about the game. Check out the Open Roads release date trailer for yourself below: 


A likely reason Open Roads took three years to reveal a release date after its 2020 debut is because its original creative lead, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright and director of Gone Home, was accused of cultivating a hostile work environment in 2021, as reported by Polygon. Shortly after the allegations arose, Gaynor stepped back from his role as creative lead and manager. Since then, Open Roads has detached itself from Fullbright, with the small team of developers behind the title going by Open Roads Team.  
Game Informer spoke to the Open Roads Team in 2022 about these changes and how it was moving forward with the game's development – you can read our in-depth feature about it here. 
"In Open Roads, Tess [Devers] and Opal [Russell] embark on a road trip adventure to explore a series of long-abandoned properties, unearthing the past," the game's description reads on Steam. "They'll search the ruins of these places that hold buried memories, things Opal has tried for years to forget. And in this search, they'll discover not just the truth they've been seeking, but each other." 
Open Roads hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Febraury 22, 2024.

It runs over two-and-a-half minutes long and provides a pretty good idea of what Epic Games is trying to accomplish with the new game mode. It seems less like another battle royale, and more like a Minecraft-inspired world building game. 




The trailer follows the Brite Bomber character, one of over 1,200 Fortnite skins that are getting a Lego makeover. As we see her traverse this new Lego-themed land, we get a general idea of what Epic Games and Lego are collaborating on to create.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may think you're done with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but Team Ninja isn't done with you just yet. Koei Tecmo revealed a date for the third piece of DLC, titled Upheaval in Jingxiang, which touches down on December 12, 2023.


If you're looking for new challenges, there should be plenty to go around in Jingxiang. Chief among the additions is a new story chapter that finds Liu Bei's forces fighting back against the chaos the Elixir has caused. As it continues to wreak havoc throughout the land following the death of Yu Ji, you'll be tasked with traveling to the Jing Province to put an end to its grim effects. 


Get a taste of the story in the DLC 3 trailer:




Upheaval in Jingxiang also adds new enemies and demons, a new Divine Beast, and new generals that include Guan Ping and Lady M, among others. That's on top of the new equipment and a new system — that's all the official site says on the latter — and higher difficulty levels for those who didn't find Wo Long tough enough already. Finally, there's a new weapon category in the Whip, which looks painful as all hell.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is currently available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you have Xbox Game Pass you can also check it out there. This has me hungry to get back to Wo Long, which I unfortunately fell off after clearing a dozen or so bosses. It turns out there are multiple dozens more beyond that, so I've got my work cut out for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world, Twitch has more than its share of problems. Recently, the company announced 180 employees were being laid off, and now it's having to cease operations in Korea.


In a recent blog post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has said the service will shut down business in Korea, effective February 27, 2024. The statement goes on to say that it was a "difficult decision" but the "the cost to operate" Twitch in the country is "prohibitively expensive."

Clancy explains that the company had spent time trying to reduce the cost of running in Korea, saying that the team "experimented with a peer-to-peer model for source quality." All efforts appear to be in vain, though, with the platform saying it's been "operating at a loss."


What happens to Korean streamers?


Obviously, this means that anyone in Korea who uses Twitch to broadcast won't be able to come the end of February. In the blog post, Clancy says streamers who "devoted significant time and effort into building their communities" will be helped.


The company will "work to help Twitch streamers in Korea move their communities to alternative livestreaming services." Sadly, those who are perhaps not on Twitch's radar will unlikely be given a hand.


Last month, it was also announced that Twitch was being dropped from the Nintendo Switch, owing to numerous and recurring issues with the app. The Amazon-owned service will no doubt continue to dominate the streaming market, but these avenues being closed off will no doubt be harmful for business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyrim mods have always been a vital aspect in keeping the aging Elder Scrolls game alive and well. While the vast majority of them are free to download and install, Bethesda is once again interested in keeping some of the higher quality ones back for profit.


A recent update for Skyrim was sent out and with it, Bethesda announced Creations, a new way for "players to discover, download and play community-made content." In a nutshell, it means modders specially picked by the developer can earn a bit of money for their mods. That's right, you'll have to pay for these if you want to play them.




An FAQ explains those that have been vetted – referred to as "Verified Creators" – can set a price for mods "from a set selection of options." They will then receive royalties from their content. While anyone can apply to be entered into the "Verified Creator Program," it seems it's reserved mainly for those with experience and expertise, possibly bordering on professional levels.


Because it was so popular last time...


As you can imagine, it isn't going down well with the Skyrim community at all. Recent reviews on Steam show many are angry about this new "evolution," as Bethesda is calling it. Not only does it reintroduce paid community content, but some have said the update has broken some mods.


Something similar was attempted back in 2015, when Bethesda teamed up with Valve to implement a way of getting players to pay for custom mods. That didn't go down well then, either, so it's interesting that it's being tried again.


Whether this is something that's being attempted to see if it'll work with Starfield is just speculation on my part. It should be noted that modders can choose to upload content to Skyrim for free. But in any case, the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio is once again making itself unpopular among the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Day of the Devs Digital Showcase, SFB Games, the developers behind Snipperclips and the upcoming Crow Country, has revealed that their 2019 detective hit Tangle Tower is getting a sequel called The Mermaid’s Tongue. It’s set to release on PC in 2024, but has a demo available today.


The Mermaid’s Tongue is once again a murder mystery that brings back the duo of Grimoire and Sally. It will once again be a mix of point-and-click adventure, visual novel, and puzzle game. This time, the victim is the “captain of the world’s strangest submarine.” I’m going to directly quote the press release on why it’s so strange: “Some say the captain was an immortal time-traveler. Others say he was a vampire, cursed to stay hidden beneath the waves forever.” Yeah, me too.




What’s been shown off so far is what you’d expect from a Tangle Tower sequel. Wonderfully animated characters and fabulous backgrounds. I could watch that animation all day.


I played the demo, which does a great job of setting up the mystery and getting you hooked in before it stops abruptly. When it ended, I audibly said, “You dick!” I mean, I didn’t expect a demo to contain the whole game. It was inevitably going to end mid-mystery, but it feels like an episode of Columbo showed the murder and cut out before the investigation. That's a me problem. I probably shouldn’t have played the demo, I guess.


The Mermaid’s Tongue has a planned release in 2024 on PC. The demo is available today.

Pixpil's gorgeous adventure game Eastward is getting farming DLC, and it's out on 31st January 2024 on Nintendo Switch. The date was revealed during the Wholesome Snack presentation, which followed Day of the Devs Game Awards showcase.
Eastward: Octopia was announced earlier this year and is set in a parallel world where Sam and John don't need to worry about the miasma that plagues the main game. So this is a much more relaxing experience than the base game! We also have to appreciate the cheeky little Animal Crossing in the YouTube description. "Population.... growing!?" We see you, Chucklefish.

As for the reason for these layoffs, League of Geeks co-founder Trent Kusters states: 



“Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Wholesome Snack Showcase, Armor Games Studios and Bluecurse Studios announced that Snacko, the cat-fronted farming game, is set to enter Early Access… now. Right now! Go look!


Snacko is a farming sim much like Stardew Valley (and Harvest Moon before it). You grow crops, raise livestock, and help a town learn to love again. Also, you have to push back miasma born from a curse that has overtaken the town of Snacko. All the while being a cat.




I’m going to be honest with you: I actually knew this drop was going to happen ahead of time. I was only pretending to be surprised. I’m sorry for the betrayal. I also got to play it early and can tell you’re in for a cute time.


Aside from the visuals, one of Snacko’s big draws is the fact that you can seemingly build and customize anything. I think that includes the town, but I tried picking up somebody’s house, and it wouldn’t let me. It might just not let me do anything in town yet. I only really played enough to clear the tutorial.


It feels good so far, and its bright visuals with 2D characters look like a mix of a DS game and Mega Man Legends. The two-member developer states that they hope to have Snacko in Early Access for a year. In its current state, most of the game’s core systems are in place, and you can play the story from start to finish. From the sounds of things, Early Access is mostly going to be about getting feedback to help fix and polish its various elements.


Snacko is available on PC via Steam Early Access. It will also be coming to Switch, PS4, and PS5 in 2024.

Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. 
Mimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio. Naturally, spoilers circle these waters like hungry sharks, but if you're resigned to such a fate, let's dive in below.

As I mentioned in our RPS reacts piece, I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of a renewed Vice City and you bet I'll be there for the inevitable five-minute narrated trailer that begins with a person saying, "Welcome to Vice City".
There's no doubt Vice City is going to be dense and chaotic, going by all the twerking and the social media parodies of real life Florida folks. But really, I do hope that Rockstar doesn't just reserve next-gen's horsepower for wildness. I want some peace, some quiet, some innocuous suburbs to laze around in. That would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultros is one of those games you can't help but pay attention to. Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the launch of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1, Epic Games revealed Lego Fortnite, a new experience that takes the familiarity of Fortnite and mashes it together with Lego for a new survival adventure experience. Today, Epic Games and Lego released a cinematic trailer for Lego Fortnite that reveals crafting, combat, multiplayer team-ups, a massive world to explore, and more. 
The trailer begins with a standard Fortnite character – Brite Bomber – running into a reality-shifting rift that transports her to a Lego-fied world. There are Lego sheep, castle-like structures, rolling hills and plains, and, unfortunately for this character, a storm. She runs into the castle to discover a crafting bench of sorts where she crafts an axe, and that's where her survival adventure begins.
Check out the Lego Fortnite cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, after crafting an axe, she creates a cabin for shelter, a pen for the Lego sheep, an entire garden, and a bonfire to cook some food. It's not long before banana character Peely (also Lego-fied) shows up, and after hearing the howls of some nearby wolves, the two craft some weapons. From here, the duo meets two others, and together, all four of them set off on a survival adventure that brings them over snowy mountains, into a desert, and eventually, into a cavernous mine where they run into deadly skeletons and a massive monster. 
The trailer's cinematics end there, cutting to a Lego Fortnite title screen that reveals the new experience goes live in Fortnite tomorrow, December 7. 
Lego Fortnite is just one of three new Fortnite experiences revealed alongside Chapter 5 of the Battle Royale mode. Also joining the Fortnite multiverse of experiences is Rocket Racing, a new racing mode, and Fortnite Festival, a new music-centric experience.

The developers have now shared a bit about how it differs from Hi-Rez's Tribes Ascend, released way back in 2012, which we adored.
Created by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 launched back in September and became one of our favorite games of the year – read why in Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review here. Since its release, developer NetherRealm Studios has released additional characters, like Invincible's Omni-Man, while teasing other new fighters like Quan Chi and DC's Peacemaker. Now, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has teased even more new content on the way. 
During the recent CCXP23 event in Brazil, Boon revealed that story DLC is coming, as reported by IGN. 


"Just like we did with [Mortal Kombat 11], we're going to release a second part with more story and we have a big surprise after that," Boon told the crowd at CCXP23. 
Mentioning Mortal Kombat 11, it's likely that Boon was referring to its Aftermath DLC, which included an all-new story and more. After this story DLC release for Mortal Kombat 1, it sounds like players can expect even more in the form of a "big surprise." Unfortunately, Boon stopped short of sharing more about this surprise. 
This additional content speaks to the studio's philosophy around supporting Mortal Kombat 1 post-launch. Boon said during CCXP23 that, "[We're] going to be supporting the game for even longer than we did with Mortal Kombat 11," adding that, "It's going to be fun." 


If the recent cadence of content is any indication, Mortal Kombat 1 fans are in for a treat over the next few years with NetherRealm's latest fighter. 
For more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Boon on the YouTube interview show, Hot Ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.

Elsewhere, Rockstar has spent the days since the GTA VI reveal celebrating the milestone by quote tweeting the likes of Lebron James, Tom Petty (whose song, "Love Is A Long Road" plays in the trailer), and more. It even posted the trailer natively to Twittter.
Grand Theft Auto VI is set to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. 
For more, watch the Grand Theft Auto VI reveal trailer, and then watch Game Informer's own two Florida Men analyze it to determine just how Florida it is. After that, read about how Grand Theft Auto VI won't be launching on PC on day one. 
How many times have you watched the Grand Theft Auto VI reveal trailer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

One suggestion is to expand geo-blocking restrictions to the audiovisual sector, including streaming platforms. This has spooked some stakeholders who warn that a ban on geo-blocking would put the entire industry at risk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After my time spent with open world action adventure Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, all I wanted was a jeep, maybe a jet to get around quicker. The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, "the humans are bad", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.

Turns out I was wrong. 


While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora does indeed have some overlapping elements with the Far Cry series, it’s very much its own game. If anything, it takes those elements and pushes them further, while molding them to fit within the world of James Cameron’s Avatar.


For fans of Avatar in general, Frontiers of Pandora is just what you’re looking for. Even if you’re not, the beautiful world that Massive Entertainment has created mixed with its tight combat system pushes the staple open-world fun of Ubisoft to the ne…]]></summary>

The Avatar films are great fun but have never blown me away with original storytelling. Instead, the translation of familiar formulas into a vibrant and visually arresting alien world elevates the films. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora follows that same tack, featuring first-person exploration and combat that borrows liberally from franchises like Far Cry. But here, an enormous and detailed fantasy world breathes life into the experience, making it both more engaging and sometimes needlessly obtuse – but always with a flair for the source material.

The game, developed by Wayforward, features six playable heroes, and a new trailer runs down each one and what they bring to the table.


The trailer also provides another look at Operation Galuga’s modernized run-and-gun action, which harkens back to the classics with up to four players working together to blast apart enemies. Operation Galuga serves as a reimagining of the first Contra game with a roster of heroes bringing the fight to the Red Falcon terrorist faction, which Konami breaks down below:

The HDR OLED display of the updated Steam Deck handheld game console is gorgeous and was very impressed by it. On a technical level the battery life improvements are significant and one of the items I was most curious about were the power/performance implications in moving from the 7nm Van Gogh APU to a 6nm die shrink version of it while retaining the Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA2 integrated graphics. Here's a look at the performance and CPU power consumption between the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED models not only for gaming but other Linux workloads too.]]></summary>

Getter Love: Panda Love Unit is a party game by Hudson that pre-dates Mario Party by a scarce couple of weeks.

It’s the perfect game to bring home and play with family during the holidays.


It’s a party game mixed with a dating sim, and the dating sim part is taken very seriously. The genre had exploded a few years earlier with 1994’s Tokimeki Memorial, and it was quickly adopted into other genres, such as trivia and puzzle games.…]]></summary>

Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Last of Us Part II is getting the big remaster treatment in January, over three years after it was released for PlayStation 4.

It also adds new interactive goodies, such as developer commentary and previously unplayable lost levels. But the centerpiece of the package’s new offerings is a new mode called No Return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom scrolling social media looks to have replaced the age-old pasttime of watching TV in GTA 6, which has prompted feelings of alternating despair and increasing irrelevance in me this morning. I barely understand how TikTok works in real-life, let alone a video game pastiche of it, and oh god, how did I get so old and craggy? I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. 
Upon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's "PlanetLeonidaMan" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers.

Born of Bread isn't actually a baking sim. Even better than that: it's some kind of spin on vintage Ninty RPG Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, except that instead of being made of paper, the main character Loaf is made of living dough... but kind of looks like he's made of paper, this being a 2.5D game with flat character art. Look, just watch the trailer while I make myself a sandwich.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I had a feeling we'd see a lot of games about nature and plants and the wild coming out over the next few years, as developers and players alike emerged from being shut inside for basically a year like dairy cows during their annual spring turnout. We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.
Nine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal's partnership has been a fruitful one. Universal Studios Japan's version of Super Nintendo World kicked it all off in late 2020 and early 2021 with a magical experience for Nintendo fans (learn more about our experience here), then in February 2023, Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World opened its doors (see our photo tour of that version here). The collaboration to this point culminated shortly after that with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which garnered strong fan reactions and grossed more than $1 billion at the box office.
While 2025 is the next major milestone for the collaboration, with Super Nintendo World locations opening in Singapore and Orlando, we got an announcement during a Universal Kick-Off media meeting. The big news pertaining to Super Nintendo World, as reported by Universal Parks News Today, is that the previously announced Donkey Kong Country expansion to Universal Studios Japan's park opens this coming spring. The expansion features a new rollercoaster starring the iconic ape, themed merchandise, more interactive experiences, and presumably themed decorations to make you feel like you've traveled to The Country.
While there are currently no plans for the Donkey Kong Country expansion to come to Universal Studios Hollywood, but according to Orlando Park Stop, Epic Universe in Orlando will be getting a mine-cart-themed Donkey Kong rollercoaster. Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios' Epic Universe is currently slated to open in 2025, but prior to that, it sounds as though the Osaka location will debut the DK attractions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rockstar Games announced last week that it was going to release the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI on Tuesday, December 5. However, the studio released the trailer a day earlier – watch the official GTA VI reveal trailer here – after it leaked online. The trailer confirmed GTA VI will be released in 2025 and now, thanks to a new press release from Rockstar parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 
Curiously, the press release only mentions those two platforms, leaving out PC. Here's what it says: 
Despite the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, it seems like GTA VI won't be launching on PC on day one. Of course, this doesn't mean the game won't eventually make its way to PC; GTA V eventually got there (albeit about a year and a half later). And Red Dead Redemption II didn't launch on PC either. 
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar Games to ask if a PC version of GTA VI is planned and, if there is one, when it will be released, and will update this story if more is learned. 
In the meantime, read about the first official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer here, and then check out some screenshots from the trailer below:

        <updated>2023-12-04T20:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been a long time coming, and a new teaser trailer – arriving on Dragon Age Day, appropriately – provides a glimpse of its continent, Thedas, while also announcing when Bioware will properly reveal the game. 
The trailer provides a cinematic flyby of Thedas’ map and a few scenic shots of locales as out-of-context musings from several characters set the tone. It wraps up with a message announcing a full reveal coming next summer. 


It’s a bittersweet announcement. It’s good to know when we’ll finally see what Dreadwolf actually is. We're just bummed to get a teaser for a trailer that's months away. There’s always the chance Dreadwolf launches a few months after its grand debut (it’s happened before with several other big games), though the game was announced as being in the middle of full production last year, and with Bioware’s recent restructuring resulting in layoffs, a 2024 launch may be optimistic. 
Although Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development in some form since at least 2015, its first big teaser took place at The Game Awards in 2018. However, it didn’t get its proper title until last year. Dreadwolf has gone through the wringer in terms of development shake-ups, from high-profile departures at Bioware, including Casey Hudson (again), to EA reworking it from a live-service model to a more single-player-focused experience following Anthem’s failure. 
We still know very little about what Dreadwolf entails other than it takes place in Tevinter and will feature Solas (the titular Dread Wolf) and new characters Bellara and Davrin, whom we know nothing about as of yet. Here's hoping Bioware rolls out the carpet for the game in a big way next year after fans have waited so long to see what's next in the Dragon Age mythos.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re mere hours away from the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, the simple teaser image for which has already sparked an internet-wide meme and thrown infinite fuel on the ever-burning GTA 6 rumour fire. Big questions remain, of course. Not least: when will GTA 6 actually be out? Yet some eagle-eyed internet detectives reckon GTA 6’s release date has been staring us all in the face - and nips - for months.

Now that plate of nibbles is offering up, er, a basically identical plate of bite-sized nibbles that you don’t have to pay for right away, as the game has seen its early access release date - planned for tomorrow, no less - replaced by a last-minute week-long open beta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze, the studio behind games such as Payday 3, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and The Darkness, has announced a partnership with Wizards of the Coast to develop and publish a new cooperative multiplayer game set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
The title is codenamed Project Baxter and is slated to arrive in 2026. In a press release, Starbreeze states that Baxter is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and “will carry the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-Model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.” Although D&D is a role-playing game, it's unclear what genre Project Baxter will be. 
We are excited to unveil Dungeons & Dragons® as the IP for our next game, codename ”Project Baxter”. A co-operative multiplayer title to be released on all major platforms in 2026!

December 4, 2023
Project Baxter is slated to launch on all major platforms and will feature cross-play. Starbreeze released a piece of concept artwork, posted above, as a small visual hint of what's to come.
In a year where Baldur’s Gate 3 delivered on faithfully replicating the D&D experience in video games, Starbreeze has a lot to live up to. But as a D&D fan, it’s cool to see more triple-A projects based on the license, so hopefully Project Baxter turns out well.

There’s no amount of pesticide that can stay this tide, nor (sadly) is there the option to stand on a chair screaming and waving a broom. Rather, you must call upon your mammalian mastery of spatial reasoning to survive. The insect hivemind, you see, is incapable of grasping the complexities of block positioning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next week, Mortal Kombat 1 is getting its second DLC fighter in the form of the Nether Realm’s favorite wizard, Quan Chi. His gameplay trailer makes no bones about the fact that he’s an extremely formidable fighter.
Quan Chi sports his usual arsenal of necromancy-based offense, such as summoning skeletons and firing skulls, but he can now conjure giant tentacles from presumably another reality. He also tag teams with upcoming Kameo fighter Khameleon, who becomes available in January. We particularly enjoy seeing Quan Chi and Shang Tsung make perhaps the most delightfully eye-rolling Deadly Alliance reference ever, plus the bonus tease of another impending guest fighter, Peacemaker, who arrives in February.  


Owners of Mortal Kombat 1’s Premium Edition or Kombat Pack get access to Quan Chi early on December 14. Everyone else will have to wait until December 21. Quan Chi follows Invincible’s Omni-Man, who hit the game last month, on the DLC character roadmap, leaving Ermac, Takeda, Peacemaker, and The Boys’ Homelander.

It’s a combination of genres that seem to pair together as naturally as sausages and strawberry jam. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of both of these things as separate entities, but together? My assumption was that they would prove too strange to stomach, but much like the cursed pork and berry snack that became a staple of my university diet, the result is a thrilling concoction that delights the palette. I’ll say it right up top: Against The Storm is one of this year’s best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming TV adaptation of Fallout. The series is set to premiere on April 12 on Amazon Prime, and this teaser proves that visually speaking, the series appears to faithfully capture the essence of Bethesda’s beloved RPG.


Fallout is brought to life by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell as a freshly emerged Vault 33 dweller named Lucy and Walton Goggins as a gunslinging ghoul aptly dubbed “The Ghoul,” and the series synopsis reads as follows:
The trailer packs in what a lot of fans would expect from a Fallout adaptation: power armor, vaults, irradiated, mutated creatures, exploding headshots, and a dark sense of humor. Here's hoping it can live up to recent live-action success stories such as The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a weird place with the Meta Quest. It's really its own platform these days, with its own specs and increasingly divergent library of games. At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.
Also, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is an enigmatic puzzle adventure game that tasks players with solving riddles to grow plants within a mysterious estate. The game first raised eyebrows during its reveal at a Nintendo Direct last November, and we can exclusively reveal that it’s arriving next spring.
Players control Arabella Greene, a retired botanist looking to bring life back to her massive collection of rare, long-lost plants. Doing this involves exploring a giant 19th-century manor in search of clues, notes, and other items to uncover the proper methods and conditions to make her plants grow. This involves finding the ideal habitats to place seedlings, for example, which may require some creative problem-solving and mature plants have mysterious qualities. 


As players find and examine clues, they’ll also learn about the ups and downs in Arabella’s life, both personally and professionally. Overall, the game has a peaceful atmosphere accented by a calming presentation and a pleasant soundtrack. Botany Manor is the debut title by the small team at Balloon Studios and is published by Whitethorn Games. 
Botany Manor is coming to Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. It will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

Whether it's the humour falling flat, or just the general hyperactivity of its main cast being a bit too much, there are some games out there that you can't help but bounce off. Hard.

There are a few reveals in the offing. Some, we already know about, and may even have written up in advance; others, we'll learn about together with your good selves when the livestream begins at 4.30pm Los Angeles time on 7th December, which equates to 12.30am on 8th December (ouch) in the UK. There's the trifling matter of the first GTA 6 trailer on 5th December, too.


Some games out this week that we're keeping in the corner of our eye, in case they turn on us: A Highland Song (5th Dec), Blood West (5th Dec), Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader (7th Dec), Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (7th Dec).

This Zen 4 design includes 16 cores and 32 threads, making it their ultimate consumer CPU for highly threaded workloads like video production, 3D rendering... and yes, many video games too! 
This is still a pretty expensive processor, but it's a relative steal versus its launch price of £770. Amazon are now asking just £483 for this flagship-grade model, and that seems a fair price given just how well this CPU performs in everything from games to scientific computing and video rendering.

Update 2.1, due for release next week, is adding a fully-functioning metro system of the sort seen in Cyberpunk 2077's 2018 cinematic trailer - as well as new hangouts with your romantic pals, repeatable car races, and new accessibility settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Millions of people have moved away from traditional broadcasters and embraced the world of pirate IPTV, where content is plentiful, cheap, and mostly illegal. Pirate suppliers are able to undercut their legal counterparts for numerous reasons, including doing away with irritations such as adding VAT to customers' bills. After attracting attention from tax authorities, 80 pirate IPTV sellers now face a $3.5m tax bill, but the bad news is unlikely to stop there.

No matter how many blankets I pile on top of my knees, it hangs there lurking, breathing down my neck, extending its icy mitts down my fingers until they're too frosty to carry on typing. I sometimes worry the cold will penetrate my very soul, a harbinger of something more sinister and oppressive. Oh wait. False alarm. It's just the cat giving me the evils out the corner of my eye because I've stolen their favourite woolen nap pillow. Nothing to worry about. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

The underlying court orders and other legal mechanisms are intended to make it harder for people to access pirate sites. To help with this, Google removed thepiratebay.org from its search results in regions where it's already blocked. This ban apparently applies to Google's 'knowledge panels,' from which the site's problematic URL is carefully stripped.

Time, as ever, escaped me in the run-up to Gamescom, but it was also one of the first games in a while where I felt I wasn't quite equipped to do it justice.

The new trailer shows scenes that will be familiar to anyone who watched the Japanese trailer back in September, but it's nice to hear familiar voices connected to this new footage. The trailer also gives us a chance to hear Daniel Dae Kim's Masataka Ebina and Danny Trejo's Dwight. Here's what Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has to say about the two characters.
Ebina is the de-facto leader for the Seiryu Clan, a yakuza syndicate whose current chairman is incarcerated. Dwight leads the Barracudas gang in Hawaii and supervises the world's largest counterfeit goods market, aided by his sharp sense of business and even sharper machete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out CD Projekt has even more plans for Cyberpunk beyond its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty earlier this year. During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.
The metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to "quality time" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.
As stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms. To read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review, follow the link. You can also read our Phantom Liberty review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.
pic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt
December 1, 2023
Rockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is "Trailer 1" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, "We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto," it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.
The art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.


If you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't drive myself, and while that's mostly because I can't afford a car, don't really need one for work and have wibbly environmentalist sensibilities, it's also because the experience of driving, for me, has been thoroughly spoiled by videogames. I mean, just look at this trailer for Ironwood's Vandemeerian vehicle survival roguelike Pacific Drive. How am I supposed to be satisfied with some stupid road after watching that? What's the point of cars if there are no floating cryptid lifeforms, inexplicable walls of energy or lost research facilities involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, previously described by Ed as "an exciting action-RPG mix of Elden Ring and God Of War" has a new trailer - and cat-lovers, you are in for a treat, because this game has a cat called Enki which you can use as a magic grappling hook and a handy source of lightning for your groundpounds. Enki has big cute ears and a beaver's tail, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's related to one of those awful, many-limbed gods Flintlock's protagonist Nor Vanek is trying to slay. 


I'm sorry, it's my first time writing about Flintlock, and I realise the "OMG it has a cat!" ship has probably long since sailed. Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as "fox-like", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.

An order handed down by a Washington court this week, one of the broadest ever seen in a case of this type, requires dozens of major platforms to help identify the remainder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

Things aren't looking great for Starfield - or at least, they're looking mixed, as in the Steam reviews, and verified but nameless devs are responding to negative reviews with comments that are basically like "no, our space game is fun and you're playing it wrong". We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.

If you're in the UK, the figure is currently £53.98 on Steam. It's the first time Capcom have sold the base edition of a game for $70 in the US of A, and follows comments this September from a Capcom executive that videogames are priced "too low" these days, based on how much games cost to make.

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or "Succession" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. 


I did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much "lions led by donkeys" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.

I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life.

I say “another” because Shadow briefly appears during Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s mid-credits scene, setting him up as presumably the antagonist of the third film. While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes.

November 29, 2023
Production on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).
Whatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After unforeseeable problems with Elon Musk's public image, my publishers delayed my debut young adult novel about teenagers saving the future using NFTs. I rolled with the punches, fighting back against Musk's cult of personality with a bold new direction for the future of the 'chain in the second novel of my Non-Fungible Future series. Well. I had expected both books to be in your hands already (and on the bestseller list), but now my publishers are concerned by that report declaring "the vast majority of NFTs are worthless". Well then! As we say on the Infobahn: when Turing closes a crypto exchange, he opens an ICO. So in the wake of Cyber Monday, I now present to you a sneak peek at my third Non-Fungible Future novel, a mint read I call 'Worthless'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is arriving early next year. The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. 
According to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:
The store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.

According to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” 
"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year," Ubisoft wrote in the statement. 
Beyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. 
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. 


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland. 
"Lucy is charming and plucky and strong," Nolan says. "And then you see she’s confronted with the reality of, hey, maybe the supposedly virtuous things you …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

        <updated>2023-11-27T18:08:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese company ByteDance is best known for its ownership of TikTok, the international video platform, but it owns a number of other companies as well. One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has unexpectedly provided a light update on its upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2, ensuring fans that its development is “progressing smoothly”. You'll just have to wait for Konami to share more details. 
In an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. 


Here is Bloober Team’s full update: 
Silent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.]]></summary>

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitiv…]]></summary>

Since its official reveal in June 2021, Palworld has raised eyebrows with its vibrant, expansive world teeming with dozens of monsters ripe for catching but in greater fidelity than Pokémon’s recent entries. In addition to capturing them and harnessing their abilities in battle, you can also wield realistic firearms and other weapons to blast them apart or, more hilariously, arm your cuddly critters with some serious heat.
“Pokémon with guns” has become the shorthand description of Palworld, but the experience packs in survival mechanics, base-building, a central narrative, and other bells and whistles.

In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.
