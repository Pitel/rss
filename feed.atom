It's a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter. So if the starting word is AHEM, as it was yesterday, you could change the first letter and enter THEM. 

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cubic Conundrum
Hamster has returned to the back catalog of veteran publisher Taito for this week's Arcade Archives entry — so get your brain in gear, as the classic cube-based puzzler Flipull has returned on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1989, before finding its way to a wide variety of home computers and consoles, Flipull, (or "Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game"), is a unique take on block-busting, tile-switching puzzlers of the time, and tasks the player with guiding a cute blob character up and down a ladder, throwing out symbol-covered cubes in order to clear out a horizontal playing field. The aim is to clear out rows of matching cubes, while then finding fresh chains for the spare cubes that are left behind. your only enemies are the clock, and some often dizzying background imagery.
This gameplay is better demonstrated in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro MGV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3OukUwYJw
When I first saw Flipull referenced as this week's Arcade Archives release, I had no idea what it was, but once I realized that it was renamed "Plotting" in the west, the memories came flooding back. I certainly remember Plotting, (and Taito's very similar tile-matcher, Puzznic), from my early gaming years. The cute puzzler is one of those gaming memories that remains locked away in the subconscious until a familiar flyer, magazine advert, or box art image magically opens up some long-discarded file in the brain. It's good to see it again after all of these decades.
Flipull is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

In all seriousness, I love Out Run. It was a great arcade title with a terrific sense of speed and a relaxing atmosphere. In the Sega Ages release, you can even turn off traffic, which brings about an even better sense of stress relief. After all, Out Run was more about driving than it was about racing. Get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and hit the open road.
There were many spin-offs to Out Run. Some of them were pretty strange, such as Out Run Europa. Out Run 2019 is one game on Sega Genesis that took the concept to a strange new place: the unimaginably distant future! It’s also probably my fav…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sneak peek at an upcoming music track from Splatoon 3. Nintendo describes "Sea Me Now" by in-universe band Front Roe as having "a melodious, punkish sound" that has been "swimming up the charts in Splatville lately." True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon's soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.
You can listen to "Sea Me Now" by Front Roe below.


The Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don't know who the figurehead announcers of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.
Splatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9. For more on what this third entry in the franchise brings to the battlefield, check out the latest gameplay trailer here or learn about its improvements on the series' wave-based cooperative mode, Salmon Run: Next Wave, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we'd like to announce the next season officially. 
Season six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or "Stylish Action"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:
Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 2
Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening
Devil May Cry 4
DmC: Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 5
Video Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. 
Last season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry.

Splatoon 3 will arrive on the Switch this September, and ahead of release, Nintendo has been building up excitement by sharing new information and footage of the game.
Today is a little different though, with the reveal of a new in-game music track - "Sea Me Now" by the rock outfit, Front Roe (the song and title are obviously a play on words). It seems Nintendo's Japanese YouTube channel also shared this song earlier in the week. This sneak peek lasts for just over a minute. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords is coming to Switch on June 8. This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.
The Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.
We recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying "Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables."]]></summary>

He starred in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order alongside Cal Kestis, will be in the just-announced sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and may have even been in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett. This adorable droid is now getting the brick treatment with a Lego set launching this August.
Lego announced this BD-1 set at Star Wars Celebration and showed off what it can do. The set consists of 1,062 pieces and is a part of Lego's recent droid line, which consists of R2-D2, D-O, and a Probe Droid. BD-1's legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:
Lego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year. This set comes with minifigures of Cassian Andor, Luthen Rael, and inspector Syril Karn. The Mobile Tac-Pod is piloted by Karn.]]></summary>

I have a history with Total Recall on NES. Not only has it been frequently trashed by everyone I’ve ever looked up to, but it also soured my early retro gaming experience. We had an NES growing up, but my family sold it for an SNES while I was still too young to care. I reacquired one when I was a teenager and it came with potentially the worst assortment of games I could have started with: Kid Icarus, Castlevania 2, and Total Recall. It would be years later that Punch-Out!! and River City Ransom would teach me that not every game on the system would make me feel like peeling my skin off.
I’m not very familiar with the movie, Total Recall. I’ve seen glimpses of it, but mostly I just know that there’s a woman in it with three tits. The fact that I know thi…]]></summary>

If you're already an existing subscriber though, this offer isn't available to you.
This trial will give you access to Nintendo Switch games online, and will also allow you to play the libraries of NES and SNES games, and make use of Save Data Cloud support. Keep in mind, N64 and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive games are part of the 'Expansion Pack' premium tier - so to access that content, you'll just have to pay extra.

HELLO I HAVE RETURNED! I had to take a beat last week, but I'm really glad to be back again in the swing of things tonight. Name of the game is: Pathologic! You've probably heard of it if you're into creepy role-playing survival games, à la Amnesia type stuff.

Made in 2005 and updated with an HD version 10 years later, it's been described to me as "Dark Souls but it hates you and everybody dies." The player's "only necessary goal" is to survive to the end of 12 days by maintaining resources. So... let's try to keep other NPCs alive, stay alive ourselves, and see what this heavily requested game is all about!
See you on stream!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No more awkward post-fight goodbyes
A new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.
Yes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.
Shown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8
The mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.
The Fellowship of the Elden Ring
It's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.
Of course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.
It's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.

Batgirl AKA Barbara Gordon is one of Gotham Knights’ four playable characters alongside Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in a story that sees the Bat family defending Gotham after Bruce Wayne’s death. In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle. In DC's 2011 New 52 comic reboot, Barbara regains her mobility due to an experimental surgery followed by physical therapy/training.

This PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S network test will run from June 23 through June 28 in the United States and Canada, according to Bandai Namco, and there will be a lottery to determine who's invited to play Gundam Evolution early. The results will go out on Ju…]]></summary>

The 2018 reboot of the God of War series was a huge game for Sony. It was pretty much universally praised, won plenty of Game of the Year awards, and sold a butt load of units. Kratos has become one of the faces of the PlayStation brand, and rightfully so — even before the reboot, God of War was considered one of the best game series of all time.
Now fans are thrilled to have that legacy continue, because the next entry in the franchise, God of War Ragnarok, is finally getting ready for its 2022 release, which fans were unsure it was going to be able to meet. After a recent video of studio head Cory Barlog apologizing that Sony Santa Monica didn't have anything new to show fans, there were concerns that there was another delay on the horizon, after the game was …]]></summary>

If you saw a Nintendo Switch selling for just $4, you might assume that Doug Bowser had lost his mind, before buying every single one available — but perhaps unsurprisingly, in the case of unlucky South Africans seeing the deal on Facebook, it's naught but a scam.
According to a report by Cape Town Etc., a post is circulating on social media site Facebook claiming to have Nintendo Switches for sale for 60 Rand, which is roughly $3.80 (£3).

Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, you should avoid going any further. The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.
These announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.
The trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.
Hasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.
Hasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.
Hasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.]]></summary>

A brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez's ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert. Other notable characters are the potential antagonist who narrates the trailer…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. 
Yesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: 
TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.
May 26, 2022
Valve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.]]></summary>

I have a serious soft-spot for Jajamaru-Kun. It was Jaleco’s almost-classic series of games. None were all that great, but they tried their little hearts out. 1986’s Jajamaru no Daibouken was the second game in the series (third if you count Ninja-Kun). Super Mario Bros. dominated the previous year, so for the sequel, Jaleco decided to change the formula to be more of a side-scrolling platformer.
1986 was the year that Metroid and Castlevania hit the scene. Next to them, Jajamaru no Daibouken is pretty embarrassing. It’s an obvious attempt to keep up with the pack but makes so many mistakes that it’s not batting in the same league. Despite that, it’s everything I love about plumbing the Famicom library. It’s unique, it’s blatantly Japanese, and it seems to e…]]></summary>

The Dark Souls series' servers went offline on PC after the discovery of a security vulnerability with dangerous remote-code repercussions, and we're now into the four-month mark of having no online PvP or PvE in these games. Is there any hope of online functionality returning for Dark Souls and its sequels? The response from Bandai Namco has been limited, to say the least — but there's a small status update today.
In a new response issued to PC Gamer, FromSoftware said that developers are "currently in the process of restoring the online servers for the Dark Souls series on PC," adding that they "plan to restore online service for each game progressively, bringing back servers for Dark Souls III once we complete the necessary work to correc…]]></summary>

Nintendo leaker markomaro is being cagey on Twitter, and with no Zelda news to keep us sane, his latest tweet has got people speculating. Let's take a look at the tweet in question:
Right, well, that's not much to go on, is it? That's like us tweeting out a picture of Epona and saying "keep an eye out." If it turns out to be relevant, that's great; if not, we can just delete the tweet and pretend nothing happened.

There was a time when the idea of faithfully adapting a first-person shooter for mobile phones was the stuff of a madman's dream, and yet, with each passing generation, developers become more and more adept at taking the visually-demanding, resource-heavy genre and plonking it down onto tiny, four-inch screens. Case in point, Electronic Arts' Apex Legends Mobile, which launched on iOS and Android just last week.
It would be easy to assume that the large, open-plan maps and pinpoint accuracy required for the sci-fi shooter would put it well out of mobile jurisdiction. But developer Respawn Entertainment has done just that, capturing the essence of the console editions and translating it to the old dog 'n' bone. It seems that the playerbase w…]]></summary>

Japanese gaming outlet Famitsu recently sat down with four of the developers behind upcoming RPG, Trinity Trigger — which was leaked earlier this week for a Japan release later this year.
They spoke about their goals in creating a "traditional RPG" in the vein of Bravely Default, Octopath Traveler, and Seiken Densetsu (the Mana series), which some of the developers also worked on, as well as what to expect from the music, and what it's like for younger members of the team to work with industry veterans.

The secret is already out, as Diablo Immortal is no longer a mobile exclusive. Starting now you can even trigger up a Diablo Immortal PC pre-load, and be ready for the June 2 launch while you peruse a new blog post that showcases a ton of details for what happens next week.

The post is fairly comprehensive, offering up full launch times, as well as all of the controllers that the game will support (the big ones are the Xbox One controllers and DualShock 3-4, as well as the DualSense — and the Switch Pro Controller in wired form or wirelessly via "Mayflash Magic NS").
Globally, the game will launch at 1PM ET on June 2, but the full global release calendar can be seen above (and again, Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now). The team reiterates that there are eight zones, as well as the following classes playable in the launch build: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, or Wizard.
It'll feature cross-progression, so long as you log into your Battle.net account, which allows you to carry over progress from PC to mobile devices. Finally, here are the minimum and recommended PC requirements (with a note that "ultra" settings are only available on PC, or select iPad devices):
Minimum Requirements For PC
Operating System: Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)
CPU: AMD FX-8100 or Intel Core i3
GPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 460, ATI Radeon™ HD 6850 or Intel® HD Graphics 530
Memory: 4 GB RAM
Recommended Specifications For PC
Operating System: Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)
CPU: Intel® Core i5 or AMD Ryzen™ 5
GPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 770 or AMD Radeon™ RX 470

*Disk Space Requirement: 24GB

It's been a long, long time, but we're now only a short month away from the launch of Nexon's plucky underdog fighter DNF Duel. Following on from an array of character trailers and a semi-successful beta test, the great-looking punchfest will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.
To help keep the fans' hype fires stoked, Nexon released a short new trailer taking a look at the title's single-player options. Those of you who don't feel like throwing down with friends or strangers in rollback-based online matches will instead be able to lock horns with the CPU in Free Battle (essentially Offline Vs.), Arcade Mode, in which your chosen character takes on a series of player-chosen opponents, and Survival, where you can test your mettle against an endless run of enemies, cashing out your score for a variety of health, damage, and meter buffs between fights.
These all seem like mighty fine ways to get acquainted with DNF Duel's exciting roster of characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY1H30c_TdA&t
In addition to the above modes, it should be noted that DNF Duel also includes its own individual Story Mode, which uses comic book-style panels and a rotational cast of characters to tell a new chapter in the Dungeon Fighter Online universe. Once you've held your own in these offline battles, I would not be surprised if you do not have a potential main character or two and will perhaps be getting ready to step up to plate for one of DNF Duel's rollback netcode-powered showdowns.
DNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. And while you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.

No reason has been given for the game's removal from the line-up, but the game hasn't been updated for a long time, and perhaps The Pokémon Company sees something different in the Championship Series' future.

        <updated>2022-05-27T17:40:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few minor fixes just came out
A new N64 on Switch patch was recently released alongside of Kirby 64, and some sneaky dataminers have managed to once again uncover some invisible patch notes. Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.
Over on Twitter, Switch "tinkerer" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled "version 2.3.0:"
Kirby 64 added
Star Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.
Dr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)
Mario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).
In short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, "Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks."
With that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.
[Update: Nintendo has acknowledged the Kirby 64 issue in a recent tweet, calling it a "bug that can prevent players progressing under a certain condition." The patch is scheduled to arrive "early next week." For Nintendo, this is a pretty fast response!]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also Rival Turf and Pinball
The SNES Nintendo Switch Online offerings just got a little more lively this week, as Nintendo just did a customary late-night content drop that involves three more retro games (two SNES, one NES). There are no Expansion Pack offerings (Genesis/N64) this week.
Following a maintenance announcement that most certainly tipped folks off that more games would be coming, Nintendo unleashed three new games into the mix:
Congo's Caper (SNES)
Rival Turf (SNES)
Pinball (NES)
Pinball will likely trigger some nostalgia, but it's been far surpassed in the arena — despite being one of the first home console pinball games in 1984 (just five years later we'd get Pinball Quest). Rival Turf is a serviceable beat 'em up that's part of the Rushing Beat saga, and joins the already existing Brawl Brothers on the Switch Online service.
But Congo's Caper is the real star here of the weekly SNES Switch Online drops, at least for me. I remember renting it because of a gaming magazine feature, and I couldn't be happier. As one of many "dinosaur/prehistoric"-angled games of that era (and the preceding NES generation), it had a vibrant visual style that still sticks out; a wild plotline involving demon kidnappers; and a protagonist that evolves and devolves from a monkey to a boy as part of the gameplay (similar to Ghosts'N Goblins).
Alongside of a good platforming foundation, the stark aesthetic style and goofy premise will still hold up today for a lot of people: give it a shot!

Kao the Kangaroo isn't the first platforming mascot you might think of when you cast your mind back to the heady days of the late '90s and early 2000s. But in a world where dragons, bandicoots, plumbers, blue hedgehogs, and more duked it out, this punching marsupial stood out with his simplicity.
Many hold the Kao the Kangaroo series dearly having grown up with him, but with only three games to his name (plus the GBA one) — and the last releasing in 2005 — many might have been surprised when the bouncy boxer was given a second chance. Earlier this year, Tate Multimedia announced a reboot of the series, and today Kao the Kangaroo makes a triumphant leap back onto consoles!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.

Capcom, Square Enix — Dragon Quest even gets its own — there are tons of places to eat and drink that are inspired by your favourite video games, from eating moogle burgers to sipping on t-Virus drinks.
It's probably not a surprise to anyone, then, that Pokémon also has its own food stores. The Pokémon Center in Japan is already a wildly popular destination for natives and tourists, and you can throw the Pokémon Café into the mix with its irresistible treats, like pancakes with a Pikachu tail, rice served in a sleeping Snorlax bowl, and curry inspired by the Galar region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Jurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters in two weeks, we’ll see what happens when dinosaurs walk among us. Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.
The Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.
The arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).
Other new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.
Frontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XIV's Make it Rain Gold Saucer event kicks off very soon, and will last the better part of June 2022 when it does.
As another seasonal event, this one will let players unlock the "show left" and "show right" emotes, which will come in handy during a raid post-win photo session. The gist is that during the runtime, you'll get 50% extra MGP rewards from the Gold Saucer, and some prizes are available for cheaper: "The Crystal Tower striker, Monster Toss machine, Cuff-a-Cur machine, and a number of other prizes may be purchased at a reduced MGP cost from the campaign attendant. In addition, certain items available during previous iterations of the event can be obtained from the same vendor."
In short, it's a way to get people to head back to the Gold Saucer. It'll run from June 3, 2022 at 1AM PT through June 20, 2022 at 7:59AM PT. This follows the previous Maiden's Rhapsody event, which was a crossover with Final Fantasy XI, and ended on May 18. There's always something going on, even if it's a repeat!

Where to start Final Fantasy XIV's Make it Rain event:
Head to Ul'dah - Steps of Nald, and find Ollier at X:9.4, Y:9.2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games’ fantasy MMORPG New World has received its latest update, ‘Arenas’, which means you can now smack other players upside the head in teams of three. The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

Vampire The Masquerade: The New York Bundle is a newly-announced physical double-pack of vampy games, both set in — you guessed it — New York City. (Can you imagine if they were set in, like, upstate New York? Suburban vampires? Maybe some day.)
The double pack includes Coteries of New York and Shadows of New York, both independent adventures set in NYC that are both based on the world from the fifth edition of Vampire: The Masquerade. Coteries of New York lets you choose a character from three different clans; Shadows of New York has you investigating the death of the leader of the New York Anarchists, while you play a member of the Lasombra clan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <updated>2022-05-27T15:00:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At 10AM PT
"In the spirit of the new season," a mystery Destiny 2 dungeon is coming out later today, sight unseen. It debuts at 10AM PT, and here's the quick rundown:
"A new dungeon has arrived and yes, it definitely puts a new spin on existential crisis. Normally, this is where we reveal all sorts of new information for the TWAB readers out there, but in the spirit of this Season, we want you to experience it for the first time with a feeling of discovery. Believe us when we say that we couldn’t be more jazzed up to hear your thoughts!"

This is alongside new gear themed after the Season of the Haunted, as well as details surrounding the "Solar 3.0" rework, the Iron Banner changes, the return of the Leviathan ("the Sever game  mode challenges a team of up to three Guardians to navigate the seedy Underbelly of the derelict Leviathan to battle it out against hordes of foes to find and sever Calus’s power"), and Nightmare Containment (a free-to-play public event).
Bungie has also detailed how the scythe weapon works:
Light Attack: 
A horizontal slice that launches out a wide Solar projectile.
4-hit combo.
Hitting enemies with the light-attack projectile Scorches them (30+20 stacks) and deals damage.
The light attack also does melee damage to nearby targets when the player swings.
Air Attack: 
Launches out a single Solar projectile with a cool spinning slice. Same projectile as the light attack, just with more aerial flare.
Heavy Attack: 
Slam the Scythe into the ground and send out a fan-shaped group of AOE flame damage.
Hitting enemies with the heavy attack Scorches them (50+40 stacks) and deals damage.
Scythe Perk: 
When you defeat enemies with the Scythe, you spawn orbs of healing Solar light that float back to you and grant Restoration +2.
Overall it seems like an action-packed season, and I should probably get on it soon.

This review originally went live in 2015, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival on Switch as part of the Super NES library of games included with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

When approaching Jaleco's Rival Turf! (known as Rushing Beat in Japan), it's important to understand the context of its release. In the early days of the Super NES, Capcom duly ported over its illustrious arcade brawler Final Fight, which dazzled gamers with its arcade-quality visuals and sound. It was a tremendous achievement given the relative gulf that existed between coin-ops and home consoles, but sadly not entirely perfect: the two-player mode that made the arcade original such a hoot was missing due to memory constraints, as was the third playable character, Guy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new State of Play scheduled to air next Thursday, June 2 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. 
The PlayStation Blog states the event will run for 30 minutes and showcases “exciting reveals from our third-party partners.” The post doesn’t mention first-party at all, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect updates on games like God of War: Ragnarok, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, or the rumored remake of The Last of Us.
Sony also teases that viewers will get a “sneak peek” into PlayStation VR2 games. Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.
The last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. 
We recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast. What do you hope/expect to see at State of Play? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

Film and video game fans have been left shocked and saddened by the news that Ray Liotta, whose career was defined by his select yet endlessly iconic roles, has passed away. He was 67.
Abandoned at a New Jersey orphanage at just six months old, Liotta was raised by adoptive parents Mary and Alfred Liotta. During his formative years, Liotta quickly took to acting and the performing arts, appearing in plays and musicals during his tenure at Union High School and the University of Miami, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978. Upon moving to New York thereafter, Liotta began acting on stage, TV, and in film.

First debuting in 2005 on Nintendo's GameCube, the Mario Strikers series has developed a cult fan base over the last 17 years. However, in the time since that original launch, the series has only seen one additional title hit store shelves. Just two years after the launch of that first game, Mario Strikers Charged launched on Wii, but that's the last we heard of the Mario Strikers franchise until earlier this year when Nintendo announced a new title for Switch, Mario Strikers: Battle League. While it has certainly been a long w…]]></summary>

I’d only just started this job and was still setting up my email signature at the time (sorry, TF2 community), but thankfully all that shouting has finally been heard by the people who matter most. For the first time in two years, Valve tweeted through the official TF2 account today that they’re finally going to do something about the bots. My inbox is thankful.

A Sega surprise stream has been announced with an "urgent notice" this morning from the company's Japanese Twitter account, and there's a few hints as to what it could deal with.
Debuting on June 3 at 20:00 JST (7AM ET), the live broadcast will feature Hiroyuki Miyazaki and Yosuke Okunari. Respectively, they have worked on many franchises at Sega in the past, including Puyo Puyo/Phantasy Star Online 2/Sonic/NiGHTs, and Jet Set Radio/3DS Sega Classics/Panzer Dragoon. Now I wouldn't expect any of those franchises to make a glorious comeback on a random June 3 stream, but those are their credentials nonetheless.
We also have a small potential hint with the Twitter teaser image, which involves a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis controller in the shape of a dessert, with frosting as the d-pad and buttons. When the Sega surprise stream debuts, you can watch it below.
Is it the "Super Game" project? I hope not! In all likelihood it'll be some sort of re-release again, as Sega tends to make big deals out of. But maybe, just maybe, we could get some semblance of E3 hype with this stream. Remember the days when studios would announce big games anytime around June?
Watch the June 3, 2022 Sega stream:

But none stood out quite like Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos, a third-person fighting adventure set in a punk-fantasy universe. Despite only the briefest of hands-on sessions cut short by sod's law, I simply can't shake the game from my short back and sides-furnished skull. I think I need someone to roundhouse kick me into reality, before I fall asleep and wake up in the fantastical reams of Zenozoik for good.

Namely, SteamOS 3.2 tweaks the Deck’s fan curve to make it quieter (especially under light load), and adds the option to set the screen’s refresh rate anywhere between 40Hz and 60Hz – potentially saving battery life in exchange for a lower frames-per-second ceiling.

Between bots, scalpers, and in-person tactics, whole communities have formed around a common desire: the ability to just buy these gaming machines within reason. If you're struggling, or you have a soft spot for scavenger hunts, we've got a contest for you — a chance to win a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch OLED in one swoop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PUBG-verse isn't adding horror to its docket just yet
Upcoming sci-fi survival horror game The Callisto Protocol is branching out on its own. Today, Striking Distance Studios founder and CEO Glen Schofield confirms The Callisto Protocol is no longer in the PUBG universe.
Previously, Striking Distance's debut project was set in the same universe as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG. That's not the case anymore, it seems.
"FYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world," Schofield tweeted today. "It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, [and] we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story, and universe."
https://twitter.com/GlenSchofield/status/1529930056725712897
The upcoming game channels some strong Dead Space vibes, which makes sense given Schofield and other Dead Space veterans are on the project and open about its influence. In all honesty, it's probably a good thing that the team is free to do whatever it wants. Even if now, I'll never get the crazy Evangelion x Callisto Protocol crossover that would make my mind melt.
In space, no one can hear the Battlegrounds
The new game from Striking Distance, as mentioned, is being made by some Dead Space veterans. And from the sounds of it, it's definitely going for a similar mix of sci-fi and survival horror elements. The Callisto Protocol is currently Game Informer's cover story, and the digital magazine has some neat details about it.
This includes an every-man type protagonist thrust into an absolute hell-in-space. Creepy space-alien designs are on deck, too.
With the team at EA Motive also working on a Dead Space remake, this seems like a good time to be a fan of surviving untold horrors in space. The Callisto Protocol is due out on PC and consoles sometime this year.

One of the project’s more intriguing aspects was that it canonically took place in the same universe as popular battle royale PUBG: Battlegrounds, albeit in the distant future and on another planet. As of today, that’s no longer the case.
Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No stranger to Star Wars or the annual celebration happening right now in Anaheim, CA, Harrison Ford made a surprise appearance at the Lucasfilm Showcase today, but he didn't show up for a space-faring adventure this time around. Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.
Ford's segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. "I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold," said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. "I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus."
Ford says they've almost finished the next Indy film. "I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold," who is also here. "I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus."
May 26, 2022
Before leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today's panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?
Right now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.

Following the announcement, the folks behind the Indiana Jones Twitter account posted the first image of the film of Jones crossing what looks to be an old, rickety bridge in a dark cave. Classic Indy.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-26T19:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.
The teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor's life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna's Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O'Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.
“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor
May 26, 2022
The opening panel for this year's Celebration wasn't streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.
Andor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.

The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. The Mandalorian's third season won't hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. 
This news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series' creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of Ahsoka to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.
Filoni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. This Disney Plus show is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will star Jude Law. It's yet another project touched by Favreau and Filoni and also has Jon Watts and Christopher Ford serving as executive producers. You can see the official teaser image below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week AWS announced general availability on their new Arm Neoverse-V1 based processors, Graviton3. Right after that I posted some initial Graviton3 benchmarks against prior-generation Graviton2 for showing the very sizable generational improvement with Amazon's new in-house Arm server processors. Since then I have been carrying out a more robust set of around 100 benchmarks across the original Graviton instance, Graviton2, Graviton3, and then up again Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC competing instances. Here is that much larger collection of Graviton3 performance benchmarks carried out on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games’ The Quarry launches in just a couple of weeks and serves as a campy (as in a literal summer camp) spiritual successor to Until Dawn. While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.
The studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.
An update on The Quarry's online multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/Bipo0yxp2g
May 26, 2022
The full statement reads as follows:
While a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. 
The Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here. Be sure to also read about how you can finish the game without pressing a button.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-26T17:21:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadline is reporting actor Ray Liotta has passed away at the age of 67.
Liotta died in his sleep while filming a movie called Dangerous Waters in the Dominican Republic. According to a source that has spoken with TMZ, there is "nothing suspicious about the death, and no foul play is suspected." The cause of death remains unknown at this time.
Liotta had a prolific acting career. Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. 
Although his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta's portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer's 2002 Game of the Year. It's sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.
Liotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo. Game Informer offers our condolences to Liotta's family and friends in this trying time.]]></summary>

Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is "about as big as an Alsatian" and "basically a bin-bag full of girders".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Jurassic World: Primal Ops, dinosaurs once again roam the world, and humanity is learning what it's like to live alongside them. You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.
The top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.
“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”
The game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.]]></summary>

VGC reports that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra confirmed the creation of the three shows during a recent business briefing. Amazon has the streaming rights to God of War while Horizon is slated for a Netflix release. However, no streaming service is connected to Gran Turismo (see Benji-Sales’ tweet above). There’s no launch date set for any of the shows seeing as how development was just announced.
In other video game adaptation news, the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 movie dropped earlier this week on Paramount Plus. Be sure to read Brian Shea’s review of the film. And when you’re done with that, head here to find out where to stream the best video game movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We still don’t know when PlayStation VR2 will hit stores, but when it does, it will have over 20 games available on day one, according to Sony. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan told investors during a briefing call that,
“Right now, there is a considerable amount of money being spent on partnerships with independent and other third-party developers to secure a considerable pipeline of attractive VR content at the launch of PlayStation VR2.”
He continued by saying, “That energy, that effort, and that money will continue to grow as the installed base of PlayStation VR2 headsets grows also.”
A slide image from the presentation (posted below) states these games consist of both first-party and third-party games. The only PS VR2 title announced so far is Horizon: Call of the Mountain, a first-person experience in development at Firesprite and Guerrilla Games. 
Sony formally unveiled PS VR2 in January during CES. The headset’s features include enhanced screen resolution and head tracking, a single cord for easier set-up, and more ergonomically designed controllers featuring haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. 
What games do you expect or would like to see launch with PlayStation VR2? Let us know in the comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to make a bunch of jokes about Two Point Campus in the vein of, "A nudist knight and a wizard studying the dark arts? Sounds like my freshman year!" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, "You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?]]></summary>

I can't wait to see Ewan McGregor reprise the role of Obi-Wan and hope Hayden Christensen gets the chance to be the version of Darth Vader that brings fear to the Jedi ranks. I'm also eager to see the Inquisitors in a live-action format. Rupert Friend is suiting up as the Grand Inquisitor, Sung Kang is The Fifth Brother, and Moses Ingram is The Third Sister, who we also know is named Reva Sevander. Reva is everywhere in the early merchandising announcements, perhaps implying she is one of Obi-Wan's significant threats.
Hasbro is also placing Reva front and center in three different action figure series. Yesterday, the toy manufacturer showed images of Reva as a Black Series, Vintage, and Retro action figure. She comes with her unique double-bladed lightsaber in all variations, which can split in two. More information about these figures will be made available this weekend during the Star Wars Celebration. For now, you can see the announcement video and images below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

        <id>118280</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/26/ps5-shortages-expected-to-stabilize-and-overtake-ps4-sales-by-2024"/>
        <updated>2022-05-26T12:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that the PlayStation 5 is frustratingly elusive for millions of Sony fans around the globe. In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn't the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. 
In the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won't be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. 
Matt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:
"The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it's also overpowering, and the design won't please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what's important to you, most especially your leisure time."
Hopefully, we'll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going 'cheap' on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's shaping up to be a great weekend for people who like getting lost in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars Celebration kicks off tomorrow in Anaheim, Calif, and the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi hit Disney's streaming service a day later. Obi-Wan will also join the fight in Fortnite tomorrow night. And we should really start celebrating Star Wars right now, as today is the anniversary of A New Hope's theatrical release.
If past Star Wars Celebrations are any example to follow, we'll see plenty of collectibles announcements over the weekend. Some toy manufacturers are getting out in front of the potential bombardment of news. Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I'm guessing we'll see more in the days to come.
This line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith. We're also getting a menacing sculpt of Darth Vader, who looks exactly like you would expect. The only new character is Reva, the Third Sister, looking ready to ignite her lightsaber. A deluxe version of Obi-Wan riding an Eopie is also on the way. All of these figures are expected to hit retailers in October. You can see them below:]]></summary>

While working on the upcoming localization of Trails From Zero (another Falcom game you should keep your eyes on), PH3 developer Peter "Durante" Thoman discovered how to increase CPU performance in that game. After finding promising results in Trails From Zero, he brought the technique over to Ys IX. Lo and behold, there was an impressive frame rate boost with the same implementation, with a 25% increase in parts of the game where the CPU can bottleneck performance. The update proved stable enough in testing to push it live for everyone playing the Steam version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. 


Like the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: 
“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” 
For all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. 
Kim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:
“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”


Hopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.
If the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic's launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. 


Them’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. 
The console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. 
Them’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End Global 7, a co-op company composed of prominent development studios like DC Universe Online dev Daybreak Game Company, revealed last November that it had a new Marvel MMORPG in early development. Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. 
This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. 
“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”
EG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” 
It sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future. For more, read about the graphics upgrade and massive expansion coming to DC Universe Online in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Hello Games just released the Outlaws update for No Man’s Sky back in April alongside news that its next project won’t be a sequel to the sci-fi title, and now, the studio has revealed that it’s launching another expedition…today!
Dubbed “Leviathan,” this expedition is the result of a community in-joke that No Man’s Sky is missing space whales because space whales is exactly what Leviathan brings to the game. However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. 


“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.
“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”

The story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet. 
You can view the full patch notes for Leviathan here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Temtem is a popular online multiplayer monster-catching game that’s a lot like Pokémon and it’s been in early access for years. However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. 


That includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. 
“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”
However, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here. For more, read about Temtem’s PS5 arrival back in December of 2020, and then check out this installment of New Gameplay Today all about Temtem.

Here's a handful of films you may want to check out, and where to find them on a given streaming service if they are available. If a movie below isn't available to view as part of a subscription, such as Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Disney+, etc., it's most likely available to rent or buy digitally from companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Vudu, and more. 
The following list was created on May 5, 2022, and the availability of these movies may have changed.

The remake of Infinity Ward's famous (and infamous?) first-person shooter will release on October 28th, and Activision Blizzard decided to reveal some of its character art via the medium of a real world cargo ship.

Think, perhaps, Melatonin. It's an in-development rhythm game about dreams merging with reality, and looks like exactly my thing. Watch the trailer below.

What if there was a way to stop the aging process and only your family knew the secret? How far would you go to protect it? And at what cost? The Centennial Case isn’t your typical murder-mystery adventure game. It goes out of its way to be different, whether it’s swapping you to various murders over the course of 100 years or using live-action footage to make you feel like you’re participating in a movie. The latter evokes a nostalgic feeling of the FMV games of yore, but the advanced tech and heavy focus on deduction create an experience …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.
A PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. 


The DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. 
The controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  
To learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.]]></summary>

A few weeks after the confirmation of its existence, Activision Blizzard announced the release date of the next Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, in a tweet accompanied by a video showing off character art from the game.
#ModernWarfare2 Ships October 28th 💀 pic.twitter.com/OsgOspGh1j
May 24, 2022
The tweet reads, “#ModernWarfare2 ships October 28.” Get it? Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.
For a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.

While we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has secured its release date along with a new cinematic trailer. 
Gollum’s video game solo outing launches September 1 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.


The game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. 
Gameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. 
We last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.]]></summary>

I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur's debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

According to a post on the Bungie website, the Cabal's emperor, Calus, has ventured to the Pyramid ship on the Moon. His world-eating frigate, Leviathan, is back. But not all is as it seems, as dangerous "Nightmares" now call the explorable locale home. Activities like "Nightmare Containment" pit guardians against ghostly bosses in scaling battles.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show.

What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they're not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?

There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew's life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
