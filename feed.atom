        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA FC 24, match durations are not always flexible, which often confuses many first-time players. Your ability to change the match length depends on what type of game you're playing. 


The game offers different game modes - some of them put you against AI, while the rest involves matchmaking with other human opponents. This is one of the main determinants of whether you can change the match length or not in a round of EA FC 24. 


Which EA FC 24 modes allow you to change match length?


Basically, any game mode where you play against the AI usually lets you change the match length. It's important to understand that EA Sports allows you to keep halves as low as two minutes and crank them up all the way to make them longer.


This includes the following modes, where you can change the dur…]]></summary>

The latest FC video game has plenty of authentic teams from all over the world, including national and league sides. Unfortunately, certain nations are completely absent from the database. While their absences are noticeable, Brazil is a heavyweight in the soccer world, and when such a legendary squad is unavailable, it leaves a lot players upset.


Why is Brazil absent from EA FC 24?


When EA Sports adds a team to its database, it all comes down to intellectual property rights. For example, EA contracts with leagues like the Premier League and La Liga to use all image rights for their products. It appears that the CBF (the governing council of football in Br…]]></summary>

Challenging, imposing, and memorable, Raid bosses are supposed to serve as the final obstacle to loot and other assorted goodies, but is that always the case? Or have some Raid bosses become overhyped Strike targets rather than top-end world-ending threats?
While we don't aim to make any of the following Destiny 2 Raid bosses seem like outright pushovers, one could easily argue that that's precisely what some of them are.

Following its announcement that Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, and Amy would be heading to Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble via paid DLC, Sega has confirmed that Crazy Taxi's Axel will also be joining the roster in Fall 2024.
Much like the Sonic DLC, you can gain access to Axel by either grabbing the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, purchasing the 'Sega Pass' DLC separately, or opting for individual character packs for £4.49 each. When playing as Axel, the in-game collectable bananas will also change to coins to better reflect the Crazy Taxi branding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite patches often add new and exciting content for players to enjoy, but they've been known to take things away too. Following the June 13 update, fans are wondering if Party Royale has been removed, and we've got the answer. 


Fortnite's 30.10 update definitely introduced a lot of stuff, from the massive Metallica collaboration, the Ride the Lightning Mythic item, and new modes to LEGO Fortnite. Epic definitely gives, but they also take away, and that has been the case with the latest patch.

Did Epic remove Party Royale?


Yes, Epic Games has removed Party Royale from Fortnite. The mode had been in the game since April 2020, but four years on, it is no more. As for why it's gone, unfortunately, we don't know that either. Epic didn't even announce that the mode was gone, and we had to jump on for ourselves to check. 


Worst of all, we don't know if this is Epic removing it with a plan to update and improve it, or if it's gone for good, never to be seen again. Epic says that anything they place in the vault always has a chance of returning, but just ask fans of the Among Us-esque Impostors mode how that's gone. 


Party Royale was a special place in Fortnite, ideal for those who found the battle royale mode a little too stressful. Here, players could hang out without the threat of elimination, watch movies or concerts by musical artists, and take part in fun mini-games with friends. The experimental space would change and evolve as seasons went by and had a dedicated fanbase who loved it. 


All we can do now is hope that Epic has plans for its return.

Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure really sets itself apart from other puzzle games. We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.
It’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.

In a move that very few of us saw coming, PlayStation's Horizon series is heading to Nintendo Switch (albeit in the slightly more family-friendly, LEGO Horizon Adventures form). Is this a crossover episode? Are we witnessing the start of a bold new partnership between Sony and the Big N? Does this mean PlayStation IP will start leaking into the likes of Super Smash Bros.? We'd have to assume 'no' for that last one, but that's not to say that the devs of this latest LEGO adventure wouldn't be up for it.
In a new feature from Kotaku, Guerrilla Games' franchise development lead producer Tim Symons (who previously spent a decade at Nintendo of Europe as a Product Development Manager amongst other roles) was asked whether Horizon on Switch might lead to a Smash collaboration at some point down the line. While the dev hardly answered in the affirmative, he did confess that it would be "nice" to see. "If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us," Symons told Kotaku, "let me know".

What Echoes should you farm in Wuthering Waves?


As you probably already know, Echoes come from pretty much every enemy in the game, and every enemy drops a different type. There are three different classifications of enemies and, therefore, three different types of Echoes you can get.



Common Class - These are Echoes that belong to the most basic enemies in the game. Think monsters like Wiff Wiff and Gulpuff. The abilities of the Echoes from monsters of this class are usually pretty weak and very common.

I find that the best way to uncover new science fiction books you want to read is to think about what you want to get from them. For example, I've watched a fair few older sci-fi movies and shows on Netflix, but the ones that stand out to me are those where the stakes for the characters are raised.

That said, Salvation's Edge will test even the most seasoned Fireteam, with The Witness, or the Zenith encounter, capping off the experience.


Salvation's Edge focuses on puzzles and problem-solving throughout most of the Raid, forgoing actual bosses for all but two encounters. Substratum acquainted players with plates and Resonance mechanics, and Dissipation threw a boss into the mix. Repository crossed wires to ensure players stayed on their toes, and Verity confused Guardians with statues and 3D shapes. Finally, Guardians will face off against The Witness in Zenith, but Bungie didn't let up on the gas regarding complex mechanics.

Growing up, I didn't spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

The publisher announced plans to kick off its LRG3 2024 showcase next week, with the stream set to go live on June 20 at 11:00 a.m. PT / 2:00 p.m. ET.


The showcase will be available to watch via Twitch and YouTube.

While the primary focus is naturally on physical releases, the LRG3 showcases aren't bereft of fresh game announcements. Last year's event brought with it some unexpected news, including the first announcement of the enhanced port of Super Famicom survival horror classic Clock Tower. That one has WayForward partnering with Limited Run Games and using its Carbon Engine to retain the essence of the original and add new features, from a new animated opening to save states and beyond.


The 2023 showcase also revealed physical release plans for Tiger Heli, The Making of Karateka, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game soundtracks on vinyl, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 on Switch, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and more. It was also the first time we got a look at the spiritual successor to the notorious CD-i Zelda games, Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore. 


We don't have much to go on right now other than looking forward to seeing some of their "biggest upcoming physical and digital releases." Basically, anything could happen, so we'll definitely be tuning in to see what Limited Run Games and the developers partnering with them are up to for the rest of this year and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angel Breath is a resource in Diablo 4 that is needed for crafting Potion Upgrades, Incenses, and Elixirs. While you may not necessarily craft the latter two, it’s an important thing to have because they are actually quite good, especially when min-maxing into the endgame activities.


How to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4


The best way to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4 is to farm Radiant and Resplendent Chests from public events all throughout the world and in Dungeons. Basically, any time you see an orange circle appear on your map or an upside-down triangle with three dots on each side, it indicates where an event is. 


Once you get into the radius of the place, you’ll see “Event Joined” on your screen. Complete the event, preferably by meeting the requirements. Upon completing the event, the aforementioned chests should contain some units of Angel Breath. 


You can also farm this resource when taking on the normal and Nightmare Dungeons. Since they also have events inside, you can earn a few units of Angel Breath while getting a first-time Aspect reward or farming Glyph XP for your Paragon board.

Best way to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4


Similar to participating in events for Angel Breath, the best way to farm this resource is to partake in these during the Helltide. Everything spawns quicker here and there are more players active in these areas. 


Because of that, you’re oftentimes going to run into events that are already in progress. So as you’re roaming around and collecting Aberrant Cinders to open the Helltide chests, you can easily snag a bunch of chest drops that will almost certainly contain Angel Breath.


If you happen to catch the tail end of an event, you may still reap a few rewards from the recently opened chests. They also tend to stack onto each other since they cycle so frequently.

GI Joe is hopping into the fray as well with Wrath of Cobra, but my time with the demo isn't as wrathful as I'd hoped.


Before we start, I have a confession to make: I never watched more than a single episode of GI Joe. Yes, I am what you can laboriously call a '90s kid, but I also grew up in the sticks where cable TV was a luxury. However, when I wasn't squinting at cartoons through static, I was playing a ton of beat 'em up games. I hope that's enough authority for some of you dyed-in-the-wool Joe fans. For the most part, I have enough experience in the genre to know that Wrath of Cobra is lacking at this stage.

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

Lemay-Comtois told VGC in an interview that fans can expect Assassin’s Creed Shadows map size to be “roughly similar to Origins” which makes it “smaller than Valhalla in terms of territory.” He also explained that there are “some body of water around Japan” but it is not similar to how “[Odyssey’s] Greece was, [which was] half water.” He adds that “coastlines and lake Biwa” will be a part of the Shadows map.

Introduced as part of Fortnite's 30.10 update, the Ride the Lightning guitar lets you create an arc of lightning that you, and your teammates, can ride. Shooting you up into the air, you can then use it to rotate to a new location or to escape from a battle that you're losing. 


Don't worry if you don't know how to get it though, as I've got you covered. Here's where to find the Ride the Lightning Mythic item in Fortnite. 


Where to get Ride the Lightning guitar in Fortnite


Ride the Lightning guitars can be found in Chests scattered around the island, or on the floor as ground loot. You can also find them on the Metallica Loot Island, which spawns in the middle of matches. Should you get up there, you can rock out with the four members of the legendary band and get a Ride the Lightning guitar as a reward.

This will come as good news to many players, as sometimes getting a Mythic item can be a pain, especially if you need to defeat an NPC to get your hands on it. Thankfully, that's not the case here, and anyone can pick it up and use it. 


In fact, in the few games I've played since the update was released, I've seen quite a few of them sitting around the island, so it doesn't look like they'll be that hard to find either. So get into the action, pick up a guitar, and zap up into the sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you use Steam or not, anyone who's a gamer knows it's the biggest digital platform for PC. Valve's storefront has been a staple in the modern gaming world for two decades, but with that power, there comes a decent amount of backlash. This time it's from the UK.


According to a recent report from the BBC, Steam is being sued, with accusations that the Valve Corporation is "using its market dominance to overcharge 14 million people in the UK." The company is also being accused of "rigging the market," which in turn is taking advantage of gamers.

The antitrust lawsuit is being filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and was initiated by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt. The claim is also being backed by the Milberg London LLP law firm, with the report going on to say that Steam/Valve is being sued to the tune of £656m (around $839m, according to XE.com).


We've been here before


As noted by the BBC report, Shotbolt has been accusing the company of "breaking UK competition law for at least six years." Indeed, this is not the first time the issue has come to the fore.


The fact that Steam takes a 30% commission has been a point of contention in the past. In 2022, a US judge ruled that Valve should face antitrust litigation for how it operates in the world of PC gaming. As well as the high commission, the company was also accused of "imposing its own conditions on how even 'non-Steam-enabled games are sold and priced'."


This is just one of a number of complaints and cases that have been filed against the platform. While Steam is many people's go-to digital storefront, it's worth remembering that it's also a massive corporation that's not above the law.

Sunrise on the Reaping will be set 40 years after the events of the last title, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, during the Second Quarter Quell (otherwise known as the 50th anniversary of the first Hunger Games).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Time at Sandrock, the life-sim adventure game from Pathea, received an update on June 13 including some vital preparations for upcoming cross-platform multiplayer, which will arrive later in the Summer. But that’s not all that was included in the patch. 


While the patch mostly dealt with bug-fixes and balancing issues, there are some new and exciting things coming to Sandrock. The patch went live at 2:50 a.m. EST / 11:50 p.m. PST, so you’ll have fresh updates waiting for you if you’re just diving in to play. 


Although there is no set date for the arrival of the cross-platform multiplayer feature as of yet, this update is setting the process in motion, meaning that players on all platforms will soon be able to link up and adventure together.

With that said, here is an entire breakdown of what you should be looking for to get a strong and versatile Railjack.


Best Railjack build in Warframe


To start off, let’s go with the Plexus mod setup you will want to use for your ship. We’ll go through the three sections as well, including the Integrated, Battle, and Tactical setups on the top of the mod menu:

Forward Artillery


Conic Nozzle

How to get Corrupted Holokeys in Warframe


To get Corrupted Holokeys in Warframe, you have to play the Void Storms missions that work the same way as Void Fissures. These take place in the Railjack portion of the game, rotating between the six Proxima regions. They have a chance of being given to you at the end of a mission.


Most missions will consist of either a typical mission you’re used to in the regular game, with Skirmish and Volatile being the Railjack-specific ones.

Gaider, who served as lead writer on the Dragon Age games until he left BioWare in 2016 (making The Veilguard the first entry without his involvement), recently got round to watching the gameplay trailer for himself and shared his thoughts on Twitter.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

I got The Call in the third mission in the campaign, and it carried me through the rest of that story and into every activity afterward. I thought I'd just gotten lucky, but now most players are sharing their stories about when they got the weapon and just how handy it was. Some are even admitting how they felt silly after trying it for the first time, long after picking it up and being filled with regret for having sat on it for so long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portable monsters for the kids (and kids at heart).
When Capcom released Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin on Nintendo Switch back in 2021, there may have been some that said, "Wait, there was a first game?" It's worth remembering that the original outing of Monster Hunter Stories came towards the end of the 3DS era; in fact, it was released after the Switch had launched in 2017. It'd be understandable, then, if it was missed by plenty of gamers in a way that its sequel — on the current and dominant Nintendo system — was not.
Now we have Monster Hunter Stories on Switch to right that wrong, and to ensure that Nintendo fans have both tales readily available. It's welcome, too; though these kid-friendly RPG outings for the series don't push the boundaries of the genre or even add much to the IP's impressive global reach, they are a pleasant introduction to a franchise that is traditionally rather challenging. This first entry comes with some enhancements, too, but it also feels unabashedly like the 3DS original, which isn't always a good thing.

I'm not going to cover the full patch notes because, again, there's simply too much, but one of Arrowhead's key goals was to better balance the Stratagems. As such, some of the weaker options have received buffs to make them more viable. For instance, the Orbital Precision Strike has had both its call time and cooldown reduced, m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though we doubt The Big N will be happy.
An unofficial reproduction of the NES Nintendo World Championships cartridge has been successfully backed via Kickstarter, raising a total of £16,593 at the time of writing with an initial goal of £8,452.
Labelled as a new 'pro' version to celebrate the upcoming 35th anniversary of the 1990 World Championships event, it will contain the original version of the cartridge alongside the new pro version. What's the difference, you might ask? Well, the pro version is more difficult, to put it bluntly.

Citizen Sleeper took me by surprise in 2022, giving me a rare new video game experience, both mechanically and narratively, and my dice-centric role-playing adventure has stuck with me since. I still think about my Sleeper and what they're up to now. In a year where Elden Ring didn't release, it would have been my game of the year with a bullet – read my Citizen Sleeper review here to find out why. Now, a little more than two years later, I've played parts of the opening hour of Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector and find myself desperate to play more. It brings bac…]]></summary>

Those who are well-versed in Steam will likely be familiar with SteamDB. This publicly-available, unofficial database provides all sorts of figures and information about the games available in the storefront and now, a similar tool for Epic Games exists.
At least, it existed. The newly established EpicDB (which is now offline) was intended to provide all the same information for titles on the Epic Games Store but it looks like a little too much information was put on display. Within hours of going live, users were seemingly able to see codenames and titles for a multitude of unannounced projects from publishers including SEGA, Ubisoft, Saber Interactive and many more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another HEE-HOme Run.
It’s been nearly three years now since the launch of the original Shin Megami Tensei V and as is tradition at Atlus, the obligatory enhanced re-release (complete with a new storyline centered around a new girl) has now come to all modern platforms in the form of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. Boasting a full-length, alternate storyline and a host of gameplay and balance adjustments, SMTV: V is easily the definitive version of an already excellent entry in the long-running series. If you’re at all a fan of SMT, Persona, or JRPGs in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this up at the earliest opportunity.
For this review, we’ll be focusing more on the additions and adjustments being made to the core SMT V experience with this release—if you’d like to get a more detailed evaluation of the underlying gameplay mechanics and such, we’d encourage you to read through our review of the 2021 version, which still largely applies here, as well.

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole. It only makes sense that in revisiting such a r…]]></summary>

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.”

In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

The Switch Online service will seemingly be carried over in some way or form to the next hardware generation, and as we get closer to the reveal of a "successor" system at some point this fiscal year, Nintendo is now seeking recruits in Japan to help sustain its subscription-based offering.
On the back of the video game company showing positive signs of growth with a boost in employees over the previous fiscal year, Nintendo is now looking to fill Switch Online roles tied to 'game software development', front-end and back-end engineer services, and a director/planner job.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.
Be sure to subscribe here to ensure our Dragon Age: The Veilguard issue reaches your mailbox. And keep an eye on Game Informer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard coverage hub for upcoming articles about the game with exclusive details, interviews, video features, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.
A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country's ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy's blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil continues to gradually infect Apple platforms with the reveal that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the remake of Resident Evil 2 are coming to iOS. The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Divine Trials" DLC is now available to all players for free, and it brings with it revisited boss fights, puzzle and platforming challenges, new amulets and outfits, and more. Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below: 


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hit PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC back in January, and it's one of our favorite games of the year.

But if you wanted to play it soon...bad news. It won’t be out until sometime in 2026.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time reemerged during Ubisoft's Forward event, but only slightly. Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.
The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <updated>2024-06-10T19:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

Metal Slug made its name as a fast-paced, run-and-gun explosive arcade shooter, making it all the more surprising how well it seemingly fits into a slower, turn-based strategy format. Since Metal Slug Tactics’ reveal at the final E3 in 2021, both series fans and tactics aficionados have been waiting with bated breath to get their hands on it. I count myself among them and was anxious to play a preview build to finally see how well this marriage of genres blends.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest has slid comfortably into the slot once occupied by E3, and it has only gotten bigger with each passing year. With hundreds of media members and content creators converging in Los Angeles, California, developers and publishers brought a ton of promising new games and updates to existing games. We spent hours getting our hands on the most anticipated titles on the horizon, all while discovering the hidden gems among the higher-profile titles.
This year saw Summer Game Fest Play Days extended an extra day to last a full three days, meaning the Game Informer crew had even more time to try out plenty of amazing games over the course of our time at the show. On top of that, other developers held several adjacent events to capitalize on the concentration of media and creators in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of the brand-new reveals during today's Xbox Game Showcase. Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. 
Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in 2025 to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including launching day one on Game Pass), and PC.]]></summary>

In the process, you may choose to become "the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a press release for the newly announced Winter Burrow, the game is described as a “cozy woodland survival game,” though we have some doubts about the cozy part, given that the tail end of the trailer features the protagonist’s friend being taken away to be eatern by a hungry owl.
With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year. 
We visited BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more. We also spoke to many of the game's leads about the name change, th…]]></summary>

There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released a new trailer for developer Obsidian Entertainment's Avowed, and though there's still no release date for the game, this trailer confirms, once more, it's still due out on Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime this year. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, the new Avowed trailer highlights more of the game's first-person fantasy RPG action, and it continues to look great. 
"Explore the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger," the trailer's description reads. "As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague with a secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save the island and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them apart?" 
Check it out for yourself in the Avowed gameplay trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Playground's genuinely long-awaited Fable reboot will launch in 2025, and they've released a new trailer which... seems... good? And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game's main character, though it's ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest footage of MachineGames' Indiana Jones game showed an extended cutscene, some gameplay clips, and a tease of the first film's boulder run. In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?


Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don't know the release date.]]></summary>

In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred's opening cinematic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.]]></summary>

Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


"What does it mean to be a hero," the trailer's description reads. "Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence." 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

The big expansion is called Shattered Space and appears to put you in conflict with the cultish organization, The Serpent's Embrace. It looks very creepy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today brought some exciting news for fans of the long-anticipated State of Decay 3, as we finally got a trailer that shows off some of the grim survival experiences waiting for players. State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.
The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-09T17:11:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer id Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. 
Fret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. 
Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. 
Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. 
Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Treyarch and publisher Activision have released the first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's narrative in a new cinematic gameplay trailer. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, todays' trailer highlights some of the strange 1990s conspiracy happening within the United States in Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series alongside some quick looks at the gameplay. 
After the trailer, Microsoft Gaming CEO reiterated that Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one later this year, although no release date was revealed. The game will also come to PlayStation as well. Spencer said this Black Ops 6 trailer is the first time a Call of Duty game has appeared in an Xbox showcase in 10 years, and that going forward, all players (across all platforms) will experience the game, betas, seasonal expansions and updates, and more at the same time.

Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then.

Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

Tears Of Metal is a rousing medieval stabathon that sees you retaking your Scottish island from a bunch of bad lads who’ve decided to come have a go, which was a bit silly of them, honestly. It’s a hack n’ slash co-op roguelike with some nifty looking strategy elements and a striking art style, but you can tell most of that from the trailer below:

Sid Meier's Civilization VII is surely one of the biggest announcements of this year's (in-progress, as I type this) Summer Game Fest 2024, and yet it was buried in that middle section, as unassuming as Sid himself.

Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.
