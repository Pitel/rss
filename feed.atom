Guardians are tasked with forging deep into the Revenant lair of Fikrul to root out his corrupting influence and investigate the Echo he wields. However, the Exotic mission is not just a simple run through a haunted house; players will have to venture into the enemy stronghold multiple times if they want to conquer the fel Kell.


Kell's Fall serves as the main centerpiece of Act Three, meaning players must repeatedly venture into the Exotic mission as the narrative unfolds. While Guardians aren't prevented from joining a friend to attempt Kell's Fall if they're not caught up on the story, players cannot select the activity independently unless they've already completed Act …]]></summary>

When you're just getting started, the basic shovel will be enough to get the ball rolling. However, you'll also want to find immensely valuable treasures, and you'll need a better tool to unearth them in the first place. That's where enchantments come in, and they can be extremely useful to improve your shovel.


Let's take a look at how to enchant your shovel, followed by all the available options.

To begin the process of Enchantment, you'll need to dig up a mole from the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

Last year saw the entire Annapurna Interactive workforce resign following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison. Four months on, Bloomberg has reported that the former staff members have formed a new company and have picked up the entire Private Division portfolio (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz).
The as-yet-unnamed company reportedly acquired all games under the Private Division label from the Texas-based firm Haveli Investments — the presumed "undisclosed buyer" after Take-Two sold the studio last year, claiming it was focusing on growing its "core businesses for the long term". While no specifics have been given at this time, Bloomberg reports that the new company's buyout will likely result in studio layoffs for the 20 employees who joined Private Division under Haveli.

In this guide, we'll tell you which Shovels you should focus on getting from the moment you just start playing all the way to the late game.


How progression works in Dig It


In Dig It, your Shovel is your progression. The better your Shovel, the more you are worth as a junkrat or digger, if you prefer. On each island, you have a number of Shovels. Each of these costs a set amount of money and needs a specific level. 


Before you ask, NO, you really don't need to buy every Shovel in the game. You essentially need to get just four of them (five if you count the tutorial one), after which you can usually move to the next island.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

The Pokémon Europe International Championships return to London next month (20th-23rd Feb), and while we are, of course, very excited to see the cream of the competitive crop go head to head across a range of disciplines, the big selling point for many will be the pop-up Pokémon Center.
Reservations for this one are expected to open in the coming weeks (yep, if you want to shop, you'll have to book a slot), but Pokémon site Serebii has today revealed a first look at some of the exclusive merch we can expect to find this year. Spoilers: it looks set to be a big one for Psyduck fans.

        <updated>2025-01-08T07:43:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 4 is going to be the first major set of events in NBA 2K25, and you'll be able to win plenty of rewards for your MyCareer and MyTeam experiences soon enough.


Seasons are the best way to win new rewards inside the game, most of it is available for free. Publishers 2K has already confirmed the release date of the new season as part of the latest game update. The date is also indicated by the ongoing Season 3 Pass and only a few more hours are left for you to complete it to get all the available rewards.


NBA 2K25 Season 4 release date


The official patch notes for update 4.0 confirmed the release date, and the new season will kick off on January 10. You'll be able to unlock a fresh set of rewards come Friday, and it could include some truly cracked items for you to enjoy. Season 4 will begin at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, which is the standard for all prior seasons.


This also means that you have little over two days, as of writing, to complete Season 3 pass. Chances are that you might have already unlocked all 40 levels of freebies, but if you haven't, now is the perfect time. Season 4's reward track will replace the Season 3 pass once we are past 8 a.m. PT on January 10.


NBA 2K25 Season 4 rewards




As of writing, we don't have any hints or official news about the rewards, apart from Gilgeous-Alexander being the icon superstar for the new season. However, new information will be appearing later today, January 8, and we will update this piece accordingly. It's safe to assume that the Season pass won't undergo any major changes.


In simpler words, there will be 40 levels of rewards for you to unlock. A total of 80 different items are going to be available, equally split between MyCareer and MyTeam modes. If you decide to purchase the paid upgrade, you'll be able to unlock 40 additional rewards for your grind. There are chances that Season 4's Pass could feature a 99-rated player item for the first time.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.


Updated January 7, 2024: Added information about the final Golden Blitz of the Jingle Joy season.

The games I got with it – games like Total Recall and Kid Icarus – had me convinced that I just hated games on the NES. It wasn’t until I was introduced to a couple of games on this list, that retro gaming truly opened up to me.


I do believe that games age, but mostly on a technical level. Poor framerates and blurry graphics can make it difficult to return to an early 3D game. Their design, on the other hand, is rarely completely superseded. Video game development really just goes through trends. Right now, there’s a particular style of game that is favored by gamers, but this was different 10 years ago, which was different 10 yea…]]></summary>

How to fly from anywhere in Wuthering Waves


To be clear, Flight is only allowed within Rinascita, not Huanglong or The Black Shores, so 'anywhere' refers to any of the zones that make up Rinascita, including interiors. 


With that clarification out of the way, Flight can be used from any position and any location as long as you meet the sole criteria of being high enough off the ground.

You can get the Young-hee Operator skin by purchasing the Squid Game 2: Young-hee Tracer Pack. Unfortunately, this bundle is not in the shop at the time of writing, even though the skin shows up on the Operator page. I've tried to see what happens when you select th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Yoane Wissa NumeroFUT SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the latest set to pick between one of the two special cards of the Premier League attacker.


This is the first time that Wissa has received a special item in Ultimate Team this year. In fact, he has got two cards with differences in stats and playstyles. After completing the SBC, you can pick any one of the two cards. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge, and which is the better pick. 


EA FC 25 Yoane Wissa NumeroFUT SBC tasks


The Yoane Wissa NumeroFUT SBC has two tasks, and here are the conditions.


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 83



Task 2 - Premier League



Min. 1 Players from: Premier League


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Yoane Wissa NumeroFUT SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest NumeroFUT SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 83-rated TOTW item


Any 10 83-rated items



Task 2 - Premier League



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Carvajal 86


Ruben Dias 88


Gavi 83


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Nkunku 84



Both items have certain limitations, but I like the LW version with Long Ball+. Compared to Trivela+ on the other card, Long Ball is a better option. The card also offers Finesse Shot, Quick Step, and Rapid. If you play the card in the wide positions, it has the potential to do well. At the end of the day, the SBC is pretty cheap, and it can be a good option to consider for beginners.

Can you win Stimulation Clicker, though? Is that even the ultimate goal of the game? Surprisingly, yes, you can win it.

The US Department of Defense has officially added Chinese megacorp Tencent to the federal register of companies deemed to have ties to the Chinese military (thanks, Bloomberg).
The addition to the list does not come with any specific sanctions for Tencent, though it may affect the company's ability to do business in the United States in the future, with US companies being discouraged from dealing with any of those mentioned on the 'blacklist'.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group.

Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

That's a problem. Sometimes, when a classic is too classical, it can become a bit of a headache. Revisiting a really beloved game can become a chore when you've seen its best ideas executed better by games that came later.


Not so with Metroid. Nearly every 2D Metroid game is still a great time, even when placed next to the wave of wonderful indie Metroidvanias we've seen recently. Unfortunately, "nearly" is the operative word in that sentence. There are definitely downright bad 2D Metroid games, just as there are great ones. So allow me to walk you through every 2D Metroid game, from the clunky to the clever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard to concentrate on the future of the Like a Dragon series when we're already staring down the barrel of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. With the side story setting sail for launch next month, now is the perfect time for a new Like a Dragon Direct presentation.


That certainly sounds like it'll be the main focus of the next video from SEGA and the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. The Like a Dragon Direct is set to start streaming via YouTube and Twitch on January 9 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. 




According to the description, the video will "reveal various updates and first-looks at new features" for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Considering how much there typically is to do in one of these games — even the spinoffs — the results could end up being fairly exhaustive. A Famitsu interview with Ryu Ga Gotoku boss Masayoshi Yokoyama recently revealed that Pirate Yakuza will be even longer than Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name. 


While this spinoff is enough to fill out a full presentation and then some, we'll have to watch and see if the team has any surprises in store. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is already staying plenty busy beyond the main Like a Dragon series, and The Game Awards 2024 saw both a new Virtua Fighter and the currently enigmatic Project Century announced. The latter is a period piece set in 1915, and the former is, well, Virtua Fighter.


In the meantime, we can focus on Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which heads for ridiculously choppy waters on February 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's first season was full of peculiar locations, from developed areas like Dusty Depot and Flush Factory to more natural spots like Moisty Mire. During Fortnite OG's greatest hits playlist, you'll relive some old memories (or make new ones) by visiting these locations, with Flush Factory having some mysterious missing portraits to collect. 


Flush Factory missing portrait locations in Fortnite OG


You'll find both missing portraits in Flush Factory, a point of interest along the southern part of the island. You'll spot this landmark west of Fatal Fields and southeast of Greasy Grove. Since it's so far from everything else, your best bet is to drop from the Battle Bus directly to this spot before searching the factory building for the portraits.

Upon landing in Flush Factory, you may notice small white exclamation mark icons indicating the location of each portrait. They'll only appear if you get close, though, so you may have to run around a bit until you spot them.


The first missing portrait is stuck on top of a toilet lid in the bottom left part of the factory. You can access this spot by passing through the main factory area with the toilet conveyors until you find several half-assembled toilets on the ground and the portrait next to them.

The second missing portrait is in the bottom right part of Flush Factory, next to a massive green generator. If you're at the first location, head east through the factory and past the metal fences until you enter a small area with various wooden crates and the generator. You'll find the portrait inside a turtle object.

Once you find both portraits, you'll automatically complete this part of Fortnite OG's Chapter One Greatest Hits quest list, rewarding you with XP. You can now officially say you've returned to or experienced a part of Fortnite 2017 for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Ghost of Tsushima will soon be able to experience the dramatic samurai adventure in a new way. During Sony's CES 2025 press conference, Crunchyroll announced that an anime series is in the works, with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends set to premiere in 2027.


As the title implies, the Ghost of Tsushima anime takes inspiration from both Sucker Punch's original 2020 game and the Legends multiplayer mode that was released later that same year. There's no footage at the time of this writing, but the announcement came with the moody key visual above. 


The legends behind Legends

While details overall are fairly light, we at least know the names of a couple of main staff members, consisting of some notable creators. Takanobu Mizuno is at the helm, and while this will be the director's first full series, Mizuno has already done some impressive work at anime studio Kamikaze Douga. In addition to handling CGI direction for the Batman Ninja movie, Mizuno directed one of the standout shorts in Star Wars: Visions, "The Duel." Kamikaze Douga will animate Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, as well.


Story composition comes from an even bigger name: Gen Urobuchi. The novelist and screenwriter has left a big mark on the industry in recent years, including writing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and creating and writing Fate/Zero. Urobuchi is also known for PSYCHO-PASS and working on the epic Japanese-Taiwanese puppet wuxia collaboration Thunderbolt Fantasy.


We've still got quite the wait ahead of us, but hopefully, we'll learn more about what to expect from Ghost of Tsushima: Legends soon. It'll give us plenty of time to play through the upcoming sequel, Ghost of Yotei, after it launches sometime this year.

In the interests of full disclosure, and to hopefully prevent others from making the same mistake that I did back when I originally played, it’s vitally important that you complete your Class or Job Quests when they become available. Not only do they allow you to progress from a base class (such as Gladiator) to the Job equivalent (in this case, Paladin), but they also unlock new skills that you’re definitely going to need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited remaster of the remake.
Way back in 1989, Nihon Falcom released Ys III: Wanderers from Ys for various PC-based platforms and eventually consoles like the Genesis and SNES. This 2D side-scroller was well-respected in the community and eventually acted as the basis for 2005's 3D reimagining, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, though this didn’t receive a Western release until a PSP version in 2010. Now, hot off the recent Western release of Ys X: Nordics, Falcom brings this remake to modern platforms as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana. Sporting a few quality-of-life updates, this throwback to simpler times (which debuted in Japan back in September 2023) offers up an enjoyable and tightly designed action-RPG experience that you shouldn't miss out on.
Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana covers one of the earlier adventures of series star Adol Christin, following a journey to longtime companion Dogi's homeland of Felghana. They arrive and are warmly welcomed by Dogi’s friends and family, but it doesn’t take long for Adol to get caught up in a larger struggle. The king of Felghana seeks to claim a series of statues to loosen the seal placed upon a demon he wishes to release. Adol thus sets out to retrieve these statues before the king can, hoping to stop his nefarious plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I neglected to specify that the development costs of all three titles were incurred "over the game’s lifecycle," as per Game File's report. I apologise if you felt genuine shock instead of the far more apt medium to mild surprise.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Another day, another 'Switch 2' leak, folks! This one comes from respected accessibility/cultural consultant Laura Kate Dale, who has posted what looks to be a fresh image of the upcoming successor's dock.
Dale states that the image is from a trusted source, and although it doesn't show a great deal in terms of the actual design of the dock, it does include some information on the input and output voltage. Visible on the dock itself, the text states that the input voltage is 20V, while the output voltage is 15V. By comparison, the Switch OLED dock states that both the input and output is 15V.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

After a little slice of something Super Mario 64 flavoured? Perhaps with a side of Banjo-Kazooie collection? Well, Kero Quest 64, a new Kickstarter project, might have you covered (thanks, GamesRadar).
This N64-inspired platformer comes from Stratobox, a team of modders and game devs, turning from the modding scene to create something new (albeit, something that looks immediately familiar). Zelda modder MelonSpeedruns takes on lead programming duties here, with Mario 64 ROM Hacker BroDute joining on level design. The modding pair are joined by 3D modeller/animator TheRidiculousR and composer Jamphibious. In short, this is a team that knows their '90s platformers.

In case the 'Switch 2' wasn't quite enough, 2025 is promising to be absolutely rife with new PC and Android-based gaming handhelds. It's the Big Thing™ at the moment, and manufacturers are understandably eager to get a foothold over their competitors in terms of power, approachability, and – in Acer's case at least – size.
Yes, Acer has revealed what might be one of the largest gaming handhelds we've ever seen with the Nitro Blaze 11. With a screen clocking in at 10.95 inches, it's a powerful beast with a hefty price tag to boot, costing users a minimum of $1,099.99 when it launches in Q2 2025.

Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect lots of PS4 ports.
The tech experts over at Digital Foundry have weighed in on the recent 'Switch 2' motherboard leak, presenting their views on what the apparent compenents included mean for the power and performance of the upcoming console.
If you've been following along with the Switch 2 rumours for some time now, then much of what DF says probably won't actually come as much of a shock. In a nutshell, the team believes that the console will probably be capable of playing any PS4 game, albeit at a slightly lower native resolution. They're also quick to clarify, however, that this likely won't matter with the additional upscaling from Nvidia's DLSS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not being spelt out overtly, but there is a whiff of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs being pitched as what the Alchemist generation should have been. Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

We are mere days away from the arrival of the former PlayStation Vita exclusive, Freedom Wars, on Switch. Ahead of its 10th January release date, Bandai Namco has shared a new trailer, setting up the story and showcasing all the fresh features we can expect to find in Freedom Wars Remastered.
The trailer serves as a good starting point for those unfamiliar with the 2014 Monster Hunter-esque action title. Narrated by your AI assistant, Percy Propa (complete with a nasty AI voice, we might add), the trailer explains that Freedom Wars sees you thrown into a dystopian future, where everyone is forced into a life of servitude under a one-million-year prison sentence. Those who want to make it out will have to prove they are worthy on the battlefield, teaming up with other trendy teens to take down massive foes.

This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening soulslike Tyrant’s Realm is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Program odteď disponuje možností sestavit z jeho kód jak verzi pro Qt5, tak Qt6, ač nadále platí, že doporučeno je držet se osvědčeného Qt5, dokud nebude podpora Qt6 plně odladěna (v tuto chvíli se ví o řadě problémů, které ještě nejsou vyřešeny).]]></summary>

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 was my first full year at RPS, and as a guides writer, it was a year packed with the sort of games that make you roll your sleeves up, wipe sweat from your brow, and stare up at the sky from the trenches, ruminating on what life is like when you aren't dealing with back-to-back Soulslikes interspersed with gacha games that feature incomprehensible lootbox mechanics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping "ordinary users" to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy weekend all. Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements", was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

So let's keep this brief, and no one speak too loudly please, we're sensitive at the moment. Here's what we're all playing this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crimson Desert first galloped onto the scene in 2020, with a bombastic trailer at Gamescom 2023 showcasing some particularly beautiful medieval open world action adventuring. It's got horses, fishing, plate armour and roving heroism, but one thing it lacks is a release date. Now, thanks to The Geoff Awards, that's changed! Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what's cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced on social media site Bluesky last night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? Turok: Origins will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it'll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for Tekken 8, and at the same time a trailer dropped a big unmistakable hint for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night's Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aaron Paul, he of a heartbreakingly fraught performance as Todd in Bojack Horseman, and also Breaking Bad, is starring in a new strategy story game from AdHoc, a studio with ex-Telltale developers at the helm. Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.

I'm less of a fan of Sonic's other kart racing exploits, but I'm still cautiously interested to learn he's getting back behind the wheel. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was just announced.
