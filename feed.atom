Back in 2006, the Wii felt like the next frontier of gaming. Swinging your arm to throw a bowling ball was so immersive that people broke their TVs without even thinking about it. Yet as the console aged, the luster of motion controls faded. What started with “can you imagine playing Smash Bros with the Wii remote?” quickly turned into “please do not give me the Wii remote to play Smash Bros.”


Still, the games that understood the benefits and limitations of the system were unforgettable. The Wii has some experiences you still can’t anywhere else, despite the rise of virtual reality. Even the system’s background music fills the Wii to the brim with personality. As usual, distilling a system’s years-long legacy into 20 games is virtuall…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro, a mixed-reality headset whose only impressive functionality was the ability to immediately set you back $3,500, was released last February, and it was met with such a lukewarm response that the company is now severely slowing down on the production side of things.


According to multiple sources caught by Mac Rumors, Apple currently has enough inventory to meet the demand for the entire expected lifespan of the product. The result of the poor performance reportedly comes down not just to the incredibly prohibitive price but also to a lack of content.




Apple is reportedly still developing the Apple Vision gen 2, though its production has seemingly also halted due to the original's poor performance. Though things look dire for the product, Apple hasn't fully stopped production, rather just slowed it down, looking to bring it back to full steam should the Vision Pro's sales ever pick up. Apple is seemingly also looking into making a cheaper headset, which would be an effective way to deal with the Vision Pro's greatest issue.


Bloomberg had previously reported that Apple was looking into incorporating Apple AI into the future versions of the device, so we'll see how this news affects those plans.


Many of the mistakes committed by Apple in the making of the Vision Pro could've been averted simply by looking at the high-priced and low-selling PSVR2 headset. Instead, Apple chose to make an even more expensive and even less interesting product.


You can currently still acquire the original Apple Vision Pro for its original price.

One of the first significant changes is the sword's ability to now hit two enemies per swing, including additional strikes to any other zombies close by. Hit damage rates have also been raised to 100 percent at close-to-medium distances, making undead takedowns easier than ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2025 seems to have had the wildest possible opening for EA FC 25, as an accidental glitch has ended up gifting players a copy of Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards card in Ultimate Team.


The incident was first reported after the content update time (6 p.m. UK time) on January 4 when the NumeroFUT promo went live. Incidentally, the glitch was triggered by a free pack that is part of an ongoing objective. It's safe to say that those who managed to complete the objective late have been rewarded with a New Year's gift.


EA FC 25 Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards glitch explained


It all starts with the Season 4 Weekly Play Completionist objective, which rewards players with special packs. To earn these packs, players have to complete certain tasks every week. So far, players have managed to complete the objective tasks for Week 1, which rewards players with a guaranteed Winter Wildcards/Winter Wildcards Hero pack.


This pack on its own is pretty special, as you're guaranteed a promo card (excluding icons). However, those who have managed to either save the pack or complete it just in time were almost guaranteed a Winter Wildcards Erling Haaland. Most of those who have opened the pack late have ended up receiving the ST version of the Norwegian striker.




As of writing, the card costs over a million coins on the Ultimate Team market. Technically, someone could have been incredibly lucky and ended up receiving the item from the pack. However, what happened tonight is certainly a glitch. It reminds me of a similar incident that happened last year in January when an SBC inexplicably ended up giving a TOTY Messi card to many.


It remains to be seen if EA Sports will take any action regarding what has happened and if there will be some sort of compensation in the future.

It is very easy to forget the sheer volume of games that launch throughout an entire year. One month alone can have dozens of releases, let alone the rest as game development teams announce their plans.

However, this game is still only available on PlayStation 5 and PC, with no Xbox Series X/S release date in sight.


The weirdest part is that Game Science delayed the Xbox version of Black Myth: Wukong back in June 2024, and Microsoft even commented on the matter. Despite all of these confirmations and statements, the Xbox port of the game has completely disappeared from the public eye, although we finally received an official answer that told us everything we needed to know.

Despite his current break from the world of acting, Carrey is still quite fond of Eggman and confirmed that there's always a possibility that he'll return to the role. "I’m definitely open, I’m open to the idea, and generally they come to me with the next idea and I go ‘oh, that sounds fun’ you know, then I’ll do it.

Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

I’m a huge advocate for history education, and I believe we can learn a lot about how we should act in the future based on how we’ve already acted in the past. I’m passionate about passing this education on to the younger generation as well, and what better way to do that than to give them characters who can bring the past to life through their imaginations?

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midnight Grinch is one of those rare Roblox titles about exploring the lore and surviving the nights.


Your sole objective is to escape the Grinch, and also serve the customers while uncovering the secret of the place. To reach the final ending, you'll need to survive the Grinch's attack, which will be a lot harder than you expect.


How to survive in Midnight Grinch


In Midnight Grinch, the job of survival is spread over three nights, but lasting the first two is easy. It's the third night when all the fun (or horror) begins. On the third night, you'll meet the Grinch, who will capture you. Here are a few tips you can try to escape.



Leave the Grinch's lair before the time runs out. When trying to escape, make sure not to fall. If you fall, it's game over, and you'll need to use Robux to revive yourself.


Try hiding in the lair or the Bakery. There's also a chance for you to get the Grinch stuck inside the Bakery. However, he can sometimes follow you upstairs.


If the Grinch follows you upstairs, move around and come back to the first floor. Move out of the Bakery for the time being to get extra time to save yourself.


You can also use the gun, which will load one of the three available endings.



All endings in Midnight Grinch




There are three different endings, which will be triggered based on your in-game actions.



Happy Ending: This is the ending where you manage to kill the Grinch. To do so, you'll have to purchase a gun and use it on the Grinch the moment you see him. The moment will arrive when you're close to the Bakery, but you'll need to have the gun with you.


Survival Ending: You'll have to survive until the timer runs out. If you manage to be alive till then, the Grinch will run away, hearing the police sirens.


Bad Ending: This is the Dead ending where you just end up, well, dead. This sequence happens if the Grinch can catch you before the time ends, and you end up dying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus are two valuable items in Jujutsu Infinite when it comes to opening chests inside the game.


You can obtain several resources like Energy Nature and Maximum Scrolls in the game. They are used to directly craft an item or unlock advanced skills like Domain Expansion or Maximum Techniques. To do so, you'll often need to increase the odds of opening chests, and both White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus will improve the chances of getting better items.


Let's look at how you can obtain the White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite.


How to get White Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite


The two main ways to get the White Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite are opening chests and trading from the Curse Market. Since its a Rare item, you can get it frequently when opening a chest. The chances will only increase if you have used consumables to improve your luck. You can also trade for it directly from the Curse Market, given its availability.


When used, the White Lotus removed all common items from the next chest you open. It's a pretty helpful item, but it's also the weakest type of Lotus in the game.

How to get Iridescent Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite


The Iridescent Lotus is one of the hardest items to find in Jujutsu Infinite. Typically, you can either trade for it from the Curse Market or try your luck with chests. The Iridescent Lotus is a Unique item, so the odds of obtaining it are extremely low. Even if you get a Unique item, it might be something else. To improve your chances, make sure to use Beckoning Cats.


The other option is the Curse Market, but again, it all boils down to your luck. Once you use this particular Lotus, you can only get Special Grade items from your next chest. Use this item only if you're desperate to get something extremely rare from your next chest.

Helldivers 2 was one of Sony's bigger hits of 2024, catapulting its developer, Arrowhead Studio, to an unexpected level of fame. Why are we talking about this on a Nintendo site? Well, while the group shooter might not share all that much DNA with the House of Mario, one of the studio's old game concepts does: an arcade rail shooter inspired by... wait for it... Star Fox.
That is according to Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt, who, in a New Year's post on Twitter, asked fans what they're hoping to see from the studio in the future, while highlighting some of the team's previous prototypes (thanks for the heads up, Eurogamer).

Itsuno recently shared the news on his personal Twitter/X account: Development of his next project already started, and he and his team at LightSpeed Japan Studio will reveal what exactly it is "as soon as possible".

        <updated>2025-01-03T14:58:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps what makes Stardew Valley such a hit that keeps people coming back for more is the fact that it's quite a cozy game. Its pixelated visuals hearken back to the olden days of gaming, which goes in stark contrast to the usual AAA appeal of hyperrealistic visuals and gun-toting violence.


So successful is Stardew Valley that, as of December 2024, the game has sold over 41 million copies worldwide since it launched back in 2016. That's across all platforms, according to the official website, with the Nintendo Switch port alone accounting for 7.9 million copies.




When you consider that – as noted by Eurogamer – February 2024 saw the game reach a milestone of over 30 million copies; this means over 10 million more units have shifted in less than 12 months. Some of this may have come from the big 1.6 update that went live in 2024.


From small beginnings


Much like Minecraft, Stardew Valley came from humble beginnings, making an enormous splash in the indie gaming scene that caused a tsunami in the mainstream. Are these watery puns doing anything for you? No? Right. Noted.


According to Wikipedia, Stardew is one of the biggest-selling video games of all time. With over 41,000,000 copies – and no doubt this number will keep going up – that puts the small farming simulator ahead of Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Bros. Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch, and Cyberpunk 2077. It's got a long way to go before it topples the likes of the aforementioned Minecraft or even GTA 5, but I suspect Barone does not have aspirations for such dominance.


In any case, Stardew Valley is living proof that the indie scene is capable of doing just as well what big developers with a budget of millions can do. I must admit, it's been far too long since I booted the game up. But since the console update started rolling out not long ago, now might be a good time to dive back in.

        <updated>2025-01-03T14:41:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 is going to be the biggest release of this generation, if not of all time. I know it. You know it. Luddites who have shunned modern society know it. While we still don't know exactly when it'll be released, we can safely say it'll be quite the money spinner for developer Rockstar Games. But how much is it likely to make?


Well, according to a report from PCGamesN – which points to a paywalled article from the Financial Times – it’s estimated that GTA 6 could earn about $3.2 billion within its first year of launching. This comes from DFC Intelligence, a company that specializes in market analysis.




Over three billion in sales within 12 months is an astonishing amount. But consider that this doesn't include the $1 billion revenue the upcoming Grand Theft Auto release could earn from pre-orders alone. For some perspective, as of August 2024, GTA 5 has racked up around $8.6 billion in its lifetime, according to figures. Bear in mind that came out in 2013.


That's enough cheddar to make a cheddar galaxy


Grand Theft Auto has been one of the most successful video game franchises in history. The fifth installment alone has gone down as the second best-selling game of all time, at around 205,000,000 copies sold worldwide (Minecraft is still reigning champion at 300,000,000 copies).


The hype for GTA 6 is all too real, with theories and speculations a-plenty. We're anticipating Rockstar will release it sometime this year, possibly in the fall or maybe later. But we've got no solid information to go off, so all we can do is wait.


Suffice it to say, the sixth entry is going to be somewhat lucrative for its developer (as well as parent company Take-Two Interactive). They may as well tell us that GTA 6 will earn a bajillion dollars. I'd easily believe it. I also pity the studios that are looking to release their games around the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ivo or Gerald, though?
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 marked the return of Jim Carrey after the actor previously claimed that he would likely be retiring from the industry. He didn't just return to play Ivo Robotnik, however, but also took on another role in the form of Gerald Robotnik, Ivo's grandfather and creator of Shadow the Hedgehog.
In a previous interview with Variety, Carrey stated that his retirement announcement was "hyperbole", and that he decided to return to play Robotnik because "I bought a lot of stuff and I need the money, frankly". Now, in a fresh interview with Cinema Today, he expressed an openness to returning again for future Sonic movies, provided he thinks the potential new ideas sound "fun".

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that the holidays are over, the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits on Roblox is a bit trickier to find. However, it's still possible to discover, even solo. This is the best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits now that the holiday event is over.

How to find the Prehistoric Island solo


The best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits if playing solo is with the use of Permanent Buddha and Portal buffs. With the event ending, there's no more permanent easily accessible Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits, but it can still be found. If you want to search for it solo, it's best to do so with the Permanent Buddha and Permanent Portal buffs, as they make the process much faster and easier, but they can only be acquired with Robux. Ironically enough, both are available right now as a bundle for 2,999 Robux in the Blox Fruits shop.


Hop in your ship, and begin your search for the Prehistoric Island. This is best done with the Sentinel ship, though any will do. Because your goal here is to search before it spawns elsewhere, you want to escape to the Portal Dimension if any Sea Event spawns in the area you are searching. For example, if you see a Sea Beast pop out of the water, just pop your Dimensional Rift portal, and then immediately jump out. Any Sea Events that spawned near you will have respawned from this helpful trick. If you take damage from Piranhas while escaping to the Portal Dimension, feel free to stay in there a little longer and heal up.


By making use of your ability to instantly teleport to the Portal Dimension, you can escape any Sea Event while searching for the Prehistoric Island, which is what makes this possible solo. Of course, you'll still need some good RNG to actually find the location of the Prehistoric Island before it respawns elsewhere, but by being able to escape the many Sea Events on the open sea, you can successfully continue to search for it.

Super Rare Games has announced that the foundations are set for a SteamWorld Build physical edition on Switch. What's more, this one will be springing up quickly, with pre-orders opening on 9th January and shipping expected in March 2025.
This is a Super Rare Games joint, so naturally, there are a handful of goodies thrown in with each purchase. The boxed copy will retail for £37.20 (or your regional equivalent), including interior art, a full-colour manual, an exclusive sticker, and three trading cards featuring some of the game's characters. And yes, the full game is included on the cartridge, so don't expect any of that 'code in a box' nonsense.

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

As a mischievous omnipotent being once said, Star Trek isn't about mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence. The voyages of the starships Enterprise et al. are journeys of self-discovery. It's about the people we meet on those strange new worlds and what they teach us about ourselves. It's not about taking turns to phaser each other in the face. Despite issues elsewhere, that's where Star Trek: Legends really fails.
It's not all bad, though. Emerald City Games' turn-based trawl, published here by Qubic Games, debuted on Apple Arcade back in 2021 and though some may baulk at its mobile-first design, it translates fairly well to Switch. The UI is well-proportioned and the touchscreen integration functions as you'd hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All punch'd out.
We don't know about you, but amongst all of Nintendo's game series, Punch-Out!! rarely sits at the top of our revival wishlist. Don't get us wrong, we'd absolutely bloomin' love a new entry, but we'd honestly rather see the likes of F-Zero and Chibi-Robo! make their grand return on the Switch or its upcoming successor.
Regardless of whether or not you agree with us on this, it sounds like the Punch-Out!! series may well be dead and buried for good; at least with regards to developer Next Level Games. The lastest mainline entry, simply called Punch-Out!!, launched for the Wii in May 2009 with a WiiWare game entitled Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! following just a handful of months later. Thanks to the criticism levelled toward the former's use of stereotypical characters, however, it sounds like Nintendo isn't prepared to commence work on a new title anytime soon.

If you have played The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask over the past 25 years (and, if you're reading this, we'd wager that you have), then you likely will have engaged in a spot of lighthearted gambling at Mamamu Yan's Doggy Racetrack. The rules of this cute minigame are simple: choose a dog, place a bet, and win big if your pick performs well. The unspoken rule is that you never pick the lone blue dog. Why? Because the blue dog never wins. At least, that's what we thought.
Blue dog's racing abilities are poor, to say the least. No matter how many times we've played the minigame ourselves or watched others take part in speedruns, the colourful canine never seems to bring back top dollar. We were content to live with this fact (not everyone is cut for racing royalty, after all), but a handful of Majora fans dared to think more positively. If you can teach an old dog new tricks, then surely blue dog can get a win.

Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Well folks, part of us had hoped that 2025 would mark the end of leaks and rumours regarding the upcoming 'Switch 2', but apparently not. Ahead of Nintendo's expected announcement before the end of March, new images have appeared online that seem to reveal the successor's motherboard.
Posted on Reddit by MHN1994 (who has since stated that they are not the original leaker and had actually found the images on Facebook), the post's legitimacy is certainly up for debate (though many have rightly pointed out the comparisons to a previous leak showcasing alleged prototype components of the Switch 2), but the internet has gone wild with speculation on what this means for the upcoming console regardless.

It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 was my first full year at RPS, and as a guides writer, it was a year packed with the sort of games that make you roll your sleeves up, wipe sweat from your brow, and stare up at the sky from the trenches, ruminating on what life is like when you aren't dealing with back-to-back Soulslikes interspersed with gacha games that feature incomprehensible lootbox mechanics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping "ordinary users" to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 2016, sports streaming site Rojadirecta closed its doors to visitors from Spain after losing its legal battle with Mediapro. Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several 'pirate' domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly 'dismantled' a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That's an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

At least that's what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italians who simply view pirate IPTV via illicit subscriptions have been warned for months that their activities could be reported to the judicial authorities for potential prosecution. As part of an investigation into a pirate IPTV subscription seller, a total of 23 people have appeared in court in recent months for simply buying a pirate package. Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn't actually a crime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world fuhgeddaboudit simulator Mafia: The Old Country will release in summer 2025, according to a Youtube trailer that has leaked on social media ahead of tonight's Game Awards. The trailer also treats us to a few snippets of the game's story scenes, shoot-outs and punch-ups. We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight is The Game Awards 2024, the first since Geoff Keighley killed E3 and consumed its heart in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s "embarrassing" shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>
