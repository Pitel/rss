        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranking in a competitive game like Marvel Rivals becomes infuriating when you are facing streaks of losses. However, a game element called Chrono Shield steps in to help you in those losses by nullifying any deduction points that you induce by losing a match. To know more, here’s everything you need to know about the Chrono Shield in Marvel Rivals.


What is Chrono Shield in Marvel Rivals?

The Chrono Shield is a handy feature that will protect your rank when you lose a match in the game. In other words, if you're about to drop some points after losing a match, the Chrono Shield steps in and shields you from any demotion. 


Basically, it acts like a buffer, so in any case, you are going to lose 30 points and might be demoted to the lower rank; the shield will step in and keep your rank safe. However, that doesn’t mean that you are going to rank up either, but at least you're not losing progress.


But there’s a catch: the Chrono Shield isn't something you can use all the time. It’s a one-time use per match, so once it's activated, it goes on cooldown. That means you will need to wait before it’s available again. 


The simple math is that the Chrono Shield recharges based on how many losses you have. The more losses you rack up, the more it fills up, and once it is filled up, it will activate when you lose a match. 


However, it requires more losses for it to recharge once you are in a higher rank. To be precise, it is highly beneficial for a beginner but hardly helps a player who has a higher rank. 


The biggest use of this feature is to avoid demotion in the game. But, as mentioned before, you can’t really rely on this feature if you are currently in a higher rank.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blox Fruits has recently reworked the Dragon Fruit in their new update 24. Dragon Fruit is a mythical type of fruit that excels in AoE damage, long-range, and instinct-breaking skills. To help you get that item, here is a comprehensive guide on how you can get the Dragon Fruit in Blox Fruits.


How to get the Dragon Fruit in Blox Fruits (Update 24)


Image via Gamer Robot Inc


There are two main ways to do it: buying it from the Blox Fruit Dealer or getting a Dragon Egg. First things first, the easiest way to buy the Dragon Fruit is from the Blox Fruit Dealer. You can find this NPC on a lot of islands. Once you find him, talk to him and check for the Dragon Fruit. If the Dragon Fruit is in stock, you can buy it for 15,000,000 Beli, which is the in-game currency. 


However, you can keep this fruit permanently as long as you do not buy another fruit. But in case you want to own this for good, then you have to use 5000 Robux in the Permanent Shop to get the Dragon Fruit.


The second method is getting a Dragon Egg. However, you have to complete a series of tasks to get it. Here is a step-by-step guide for it:



Step 1: First, grab the Dojo Belt (Black) by completing the Dojo Trainer’s quest on Hydra Island. 


Step 2: Once done, interact with the Dragon Wizard at the Dragon Dojo on the same island to get the Dragon Tether ability. 


Step 3: After acquiring the Dragon Tether ability, head to Prehistoric Island and complete the Volcano event. 


Step 4: After the event, a Dragon Egg will spawn near the Dinosaur Bones, and you can pick it up to roll for a chance at the Dragon Fruit.

As of late 2024, I still don't know if they succeeded at their initial task, but it seems as if they've succeeded in creating something special with Grand Theft Hamlet, a documentary about their adventure in making the movie.






If you're anything like me, the mere idea that someone remade the entirety of Hamlet in GTA V will have you cringing hard. The Internet, YouTube especially, has way too many covers and fan remakes of things that should probably be left alone — out of respect for the original work and consideration for the time of the people browsing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Christmas Cheers SBC is a simple fodder challenge in EA FC 25, and you can complete it to earn a fodder pack.


The special challenge has been released on Christmas evening, and it has simple conditions. You'll have to submit one squad that satisfies the assigned conditions, and unlock a pack that's available as reward. Let's take a look at the cheapest possible way of solving the SBC and getting the rewards.

Task 1 - Christmas Cheers

Min. 4 Players from the same Nation


Min. 3 Players from the same Club

EA FC 25 Christmas Cheers SBC solutions


Since the conditions are simple, you should try to use cards that are already present in your Ultimate Team inventory. However, you can also use the following solution to complete the challenge and unlock the rewards.

Adam Armstrong ST 75


Bodiger 69


Delaney CM 76

Typically, this pack costs 50,000 coins to get from the in-game store, so make sure to complete the challenge as soon as possible.

Despite its advancing years, Nintendo's hybrid handheld showed that it wasn't going quietly into that good night in 2024, at least where great games were concerned.
Nintendo's first-party output was mainly helmed by partner studios in 2024. with plenty of HD remakes and remasters in the mix. However, Switch did play host to a solo extravaganza from Princess Toadstool, an unexpected new chapter in the Famicom Detective Club series, a shiny new Mario & Luigi entry, yet another Mario Party, and a brand-new top-down Zelda. Not bad for a system in its eighth year with a much-talked-about successor eyeing its throne.

Some stats are valued much more than others which is why you'll find rares barely competing with some Mythologics. Here's my best NINJA Clan tier list.

I rated all NINJA Clans from S-Tier to C-Tier based on both which stats are the best and their special abilities. S-Tier are Clans you want to roll and keep, while B-Tier are Clans that you're happy with but are not ideal. The C-Tier is the Reroll tier because this is where the Common clans are that offer no bonuses which you want to reroll. Remember tha…]]></summary>

Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors as part of our Best of 2024 series. Enjoy!

It’s Christmas morning, and amidst the thick haze of food already cooking for lunch and the soothing laughter of our children enjoying their new toys, my wife approaches me with a small, square package. I hadn’t seen this under the tree. “That’s your last one,” she says. I instinctively go to shake it – she knows me well enough to catch my wrist. “Don’t do that!” she interjects. Clearly this is an item of some delicacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

It's been a slow but steady year for Nintendo lovers as Switch winds down and everyone eyes The Future. The system still had loads of great games this year, though — as our bulging holiday backlogs can attest — and with the prospect of a shiny new console launch next year, there's much to be excited about. It won't be long until we find out more and get our fidgeting hands on that most precious of gifts - a Nintendo system launch game!

You can find the latest information there on all units, stations, traits, game modes, levels, and much more. And don’t forget the Discord server for regular updates and any questions you might have. Here are the Anime Adventures Trello and Discord.


Anime Adventures Trello & Discord Guide

Here are all the community hubs for Anime Adventures:



Official Anime Adventures Trello Board


Anime Adventures Discord Server


AA Roblox Community


Anime Adventures Twitter/X


Anime Adventures Wiki



I highly recommend visiting the Trello for any technical information, while Discord is excellent for asking more specific questions. The Trello is filled with with useful tips as well as a detailed list of all units if you just want raw information about the game. You can find info on:



Tier Lists


Beginner’s Guide


Grinding Gems


Codes


An FAQ


All Units and Rarities


All Mechanics and Terminology


Merchant Info


All Items


All NPCs


All Traits


All Game Modes


Info on All Worlds


Info on All Stations



Essentially, it’s an extensive community wiki where you can find everything you need to know about the game. That said, if you have any specific questions or are looking for general advice, then Discord is the place to be. The Discord server has several community chatting channels where you can ask about the best units, the current meta builds, best traits, etc.


It’s also where you can find the latest Anime Adventures Codes as well as any announcements, updates, and patch notes. This is incredibly important to keep track of due to the latest buffs and nerfs to units. And don’t forget giveaways as they too will be announced on the Discord server first where you can score some free goodies in addition to codes.


And that’s how to find the Anime Adventures Trello and Discord. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more guides.

Once a common sight during Adopt Me's early launch in Roblox, the Blue Dog has now ascended to the ranks of the rarest pets in the game. Its exclusivity was once tied to the Easter Event (2019), where it could be unlocked by hatching Blue Eggs. Since the celebration has passed, the only way to get the Blue Dog is by initiating a trade with a player.

There are two types of Xenolord Slabs you can find in Palworld. The normal variant allows you to start a traditional raid, which in itself can be quite difficult. There's also an Ultra variant that you can unlock with the use of the said variant. Let's take a look at how you can get these special slabs in the first place.


How to farm Xenolord Slabs in Palworld


Xenolord Slabs are not final resources or raw ingredients that spawn on nodes. Instead, you can produce it on any type of workbench. To consistently get the slab, you'll have to farm the resources that are required. Having those resources will allow you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Fragment is one of the many resources you can find in Palworld, and it has been added as part of the Feybreak update.


Unlike most resources available in the game, finding this mysterious item can be slightly challenging if you don't know where to look. You'll require it to craft some of the new schematics that are available from the Technology tab, so let's find out how you can get Dark Fragment.


How to farm Dark Fragment in Palworld


Unlike many resources in Palworld, Dark Fragment doesn't come from nodes. Instead, you can get them by defeating a particular type of Pal. In this case, you'll have to eliminate Dark Pals, but not just any of them. Only the ones that spawn on the new Feybreak Island count, and this task can be slightly tricky.


For starters, you'll have to reach the new island, which is located in the southwestern part of the map. You can get there either by air or by water, but the former has the risk of being shot down by anti-air measures. Next, all Pals you encounter on the island will be level 50 or above. If you're yet to reach a relatively early endgame situation, it's best to avoid going to Feybreak Island and trying to get Dark Fragment.


If you're level 50 or higher, there shouldn't be any problem. To be more precise, here's the list of all Pals you can eliminate to get the resource we are discussing about.



Dazzi Noct


Kitsun Noct


Omascul


Splatterina


Starryon



Even if you capture any of these Pals, you'll be rewarded with Dark Fragment. Additionally, defeating Dark Rampaging Pals and Boss versions will also help you to get the resource.




All Dark Fragment recipes in Palworld


Here's a complete list of all the schematics that require Dark Fragment.



Homing Module


Triple Jump Boots


Double Air Dash Boots


Smokie's Harness


Dazzi Noct's Necklace


Starryon Saddle


Nyafia's Shotgun


Xenolord Saddle



That's all you need to know to get your hands on Dark Fragment in Palworld.

For the younger readers amongst you, I suspect that many 3D games from the ‘90s and ‘00s seem rather quaint at best and downright unplayable at worst. It was a period in which the medium was geting to grips with a completely new third dimension; couple this with the limited graphical capabilities of the PlayStation and N64, and you could argue that many titles haven’t aged well.
Me, though? I absolutely love this era. I was six when the PS1 launched in the UK; the perfect age to start enjoying classics like WipEout, Spyro the Dragon, and yes, games that perhaps weren’t suitable for me yet like Metal Gear Solid and Resident Evil. So when I go back and play titles from this era today, I find them reasonably approachable thanks to an intimate familiarity with the period. Even remasters of games that I’ve not experienced before feel oddly comforting in a way that I can’t quite describe.

Sonic the Hedgehog's third movie outing is now in cinemas and while there are some new faces in this latest live-action entry like Shadow, a few other fan favourites have missed out (again).
This includes (spoiler alert) Big the Cat and Rouge the Bat. According to the writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller, there was a cameo planned for Big in the second movie - where he was going to show up in skeleton form on the snowy mountains as a reference to Indiana Jones, but it was a little too grim.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

SaiDaiOuJou, the series’ final entry and Cave’s last arcade shooting game, makes the clean stylings of its predecessor, DaiFukkatsu, even cleaner; a shiny blue aesthetic wrought from 3D renders and a billion pixels.

Fan team Harbour Masters has swapped Hylian adventures for high-flying action in its new 'Starlight' project — a Star Fox 64 PC port which is available right now (thanks, VGC).
This isn't the team's first rodeo — having previously brought Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask and Super Mario 64 to PC — and it uses the same above-board approach to porting. Once again, Harbour Masters has reverse-engineered the original game's code to avoid using any leaked content or copyrighted assets, making the whole thing technically legal (yay!).

It's that time of year for reflection, to sit down and take stock of all the wonderful games that released in 2024. A time to stare into the middle distance with a despairing expression wondering how you managed to not play so many great new games this year because the Vampire Survivors DLC continued to suck your free time up like..., well, like a vampire. Yes, it's GOTY time.
As the industry continues to navigate tumultuous waters, with layoffs continuing across the board in game development, publishing, and media, players themselves have once again had an excellent year in terms of great new games to play. Whether large or small, there have been more fantastic things to play than hours in the day for all but the most myopic of gamers.

Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

I’ll admit, I’ve never been fond of speedrunning. The thought of shaving milliseconds off a time in a video game while playing the same sequence over and over sounds, in theory, more frustrating than fun. Sure, as a spectator, there is definitely joy in appreciating the wizardry of players pulling off pixel-perfect feats and shattering a runtime record. But I have neither the time nor the mettle to contemplate doing so myself.
Fortunately, this year gave us a game that weaved together 8-bit era charm, bite-sized accessibility, and addictive skill refinement. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition was my gateway to finally “getting” speedrunning, and it’s some of the most fun I’ve had gaming in 2024.

And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are a people who honour democracy," said the dog, scratching himself. "Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water." The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

As part of an investigation into a pirate IPTV subscription seller, a total of 23 people have appeared in court in recent months for simply buying a pirate package. Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn't actually a crime.

It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead and Sony have released a new Helldivers 2 update that introduces the long-rumoured third faction, the Illuminate. Titled Omens of Tyranny, the update also stirs in city maps and a driveable jeep with a mounted gun that immediately reminds me of Halo's Warthog, and is hopefully just as fragile and bouncy. Here's a trailer.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers' previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Space Marine 2's wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.

One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it's time to play Skeal.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say "his own choomba shot him!" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pity the "relaxing" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

Whichever it is, Little Rocket Lab is a factory-builder about efficiently placing conveyors and robot arms, and is drawn in the warm, pixel art small-town of a Stardew-like. That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you're building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can't be good for noise pollution. There's an announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokud zbožňujete stejnojmenný divadelní muzikál, funguje tento film pravděpodobně velmi dobře. Pokud ho vůbec neznáte, budete ve výrazné nevýhodě, a to z vícero důvodů. Přestože mám muzikály rád, téměř vůbec se u mě nedostavil jakýkoliv pocit dojetí nebo jiná silná emoce a z písniček si téměř nic nepamatuji. Což je bizarní, protože zbožňuji písničky v "Princi egyptském", kterého napsal stejný autor pár let před "Čarodějkou". - Ilča 50 %]]></summary>
