The Pokémon Company has announced that a new update has been made available for the online battler, Pokémon Unite. Unlike the usual patches and improvements, the purpose of this update it mainly about achieving a greater sense of balance in battles.
Setting about solving this problem, the team have adapted many of the fighters' moves so that the battles seem that little bit fairer. This includes adjusting cooldown periods between attacks, changing the damage dealt by certain moves and increasing/decreasing defence stats where appropriate.

A year ago, subscribers of Nintendo of America's official YouTube channel got quite a shock when 'Nintendo Minute' hosts Kit and Krysta uploaded their final video after more than 8 years and over 400 episodes.
If you've ever wanted to go back and relive the journey, you might want to hurry up. After just over a year since their departure from Nintendo, Kit and Krysta have noted on social media how Nintendo is now setting these episodes to private.

The Nintendo 64 era was loaded with plenty of exciting first-party releases, but one that you might not always consider when reflecting on this generation is Yoshi's Story. This delightful side-scrolling platfomer was first released in Japan in 1997 and today marks a special milestone.
Yes, believe it or not, but the N64 title Yoshi's Story is now officially 25 years old based on its original release on 21st December 1997. To celebrate this occasion, Nintendo has taken time out of its own busy schedule on social media to ask fans their favourite memories.

2022 saw gaming shift in a lot of big ways. But amid a clamor of big headlines, Valve managed to work its way into the home console space with the Steam Deck this year. And this one really seems like it's going to stick it out.
Valve has had a, let's say, interesting record when it comes to home hardware launches. The build-your-own PC nature of the Steam Machine didn't really take off, and neither did the Steam Link. Even the Steam Controller, which has its defenders, got lumped in with the successes and failures of Valve's work to put a box in the living room.
This year, Valve launched the Steam Deck, a new attempt at portable PC gaming. It was revealed as a surprisingly flexible piece of hardware; it can stream games or run them itself…]]></summary>

The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match's normal running time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Season 5 update is also its last major one
Major support for Chocobo GP is coming to an end. Today, Square Enix confirms that there won't be any further large-scale updates to Chocobo GP after the Season 5 update that goes live today, December 21.
What it means by "large-scale" is that major additions, like new characters or maps, will not be arriving in any further updates. Season 5 will also be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the special Chocobo GP mode. The GP mode will still be playable and rankings will continue, without the use of prize pass levels, in the same manner as the current season off period.
Sales of Mythril, a currency for the shop, have also been discontinued on the Nintendo eShop. Players who have Mythril can still spend it, up until the shop disappears on January 6, 2023. The currency is not refundable either.
New items will continue to be added to the shop during the course of Season 5, but the same items may also go into the ticket or gil shops, making them available without Mythril. Items originally added to the Mythril shop during Seasons 1 through 4 "may" also be added to the ticket or gil shops, per Square Enix's announcement.

Hitting the brakes
This effectively means Chocobo GP is hitting the brakes on its online support. New characters and maps are coming to a close, the premium currency shop is closing, and it sounds like Season 5 will be the last major one.
It's a bummer to see. Chocobo GP didn't receive the warmest reception, but my fond memories of Chocobo Racing had me hoping this one would turn things around a bit over time. It looks like that's not the case, as the game's ending major support within the same calendar year as its launch.

I talk about this often in reviews, but one of my favorite parts of the gig is playing games in complete isolation. When the discourse starts with some games it's impossible to escape, but there's nothing quite like immersing yourself in a massive JRPG in utter silence and taking it all in. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was one of my favorite of those experiences in recent memory: which is why I'm not surprised it's winning our award for best Switch game of 2022.
Once it actually came out, it was amazing to see the positive reactions folks had, especially the connections many forged with the really strong sidequests and diversions. It's one thing for a JRPG to give us a strong cast and engaging narrative; but it's another thing entirely to ensure that the same amount of car…]]></summary>

Compile Heart, the Japanese developer behind the relentless Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise, has announced that it has a grand reveal planned to kick off its new year. The announcement will be made in the January 19 issue of popular publication Weekly Famitsu, though no further details were announced.
At this point, we can do little but speculate, but given Compile Heart's seemingly endless ability to repackage the cheesecake universe of Nep-Nep and friends into almost any genre, we can only assume that the residents of Gameindustri are getting set to embark upon another colorful and goofy adventure.
The most recent title in the series, Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters launched in Japan in the spring of this year, and is headed west next month — just in time for this new announcement, in fact. Convenient. Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters will launch January 2023 on PlayStation and PC platforms, and will be the first title in the series since 2018's Super Neptunia RPG to feature a fully localized English dub.

The latest from Vanillaware has a western release date. GrimGrimoire OnceMore arrives for PlayStation 4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2023.
This remaster of Vanillaware's PlayStation 2 game GrimGrimoire updated the resolution and screen ratio, while also adding some new gameplay features. New and improved mechanics have been added to its magical school RTS battles, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOFwoilgAeE
The setup of GrimGrimoire OnceMore is that you're Lillet Blan, a new student at Silver Star Tower, training to become a great magician. But as mysteries and secrets are uncovered, Lillet will have to fight using her familiars to uncover the truth.
It's a bit of a strange set-up, but looks absolutely gorgeous in motion. I'm personally pretty interested in this just to see the RTS development of Vanillaware's from years past. The studio is well-known for its 2D action games, but 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim also took on a strategy approach and knocked it out of the park, becoming one of my favorite games of 2020.
Play it one more time
Seeing more of Vanillaware's back catalog get the remaster treatment is certainly exciting, too. Between 13 Sentinels and the Odin Sphere remake, I've been drawn back into the studio's work. So getting to see another piece of its history updated for modern consoles is a delight.
With English and Japanese voice options, new spells to wield, and more to explore, there's a lot to like here. GrimGrimoire is charging into a heavily packed 2023 launch lineup, for sure. But with April looking particularly thin if you're not a Dead Island fan, I think there will be some time found to play through this one.

A big part of a creative process is knowing that it's okay to start over. You might have an amazing initial idea, but as you put it into action, whether writing a book, drawing a picture, or making a game, you might discover that you can do better than that first idea. And that's okay. It's all part of the process. Just ask Ken Levine.
But sometimes, you get lucky, and the first idea you have knocks it out of the park. That's what happened with Second Dinner, the developers behind Destructoid's pick for the Best Mobile Game of 2022. As studio co-founder Ben Brode told the Washington Post in October:
"We came up with the idea for ‘Marvel Snap’ pretty quickly. In fact, it was so fun so fast, we actually put it on pause and said, ‘Look, we’ve got to explore some other stuff. We ca…]]></summary>

Another year has come and gone (almost) and once more we're looking back over all the games we've played, along with those we wish we had played. It's been a great year for Switch releases, with a crop of excellent first-party Nintendo games joined by some great third-party offerings (Square Enix, in particular, has been on fire the last few months), plus choice ports of older titles and more incredible indies than we know what to do with.
While our Top 50 reader-ranked list of the Best Switch Games of 2022 serves as the main course in our GOTY rankings (and will be published soon!), we also publish an annual NL staff GOTY list. Typically, we compile all nominations in a spreadsheet, and then everyone on staff adds points in reverse order for their top 10 games of the year, which is then tabulated to create our 10 staff picks. This is fine but a) it tends to produce a crop very similar to our reader-ranked counterpart, and b) smaller games — ones that rank very highly on our personal lists — usually get pushed off the bottom by familiar big-name fare, despite the passion they inspire in individual team members.

Square Enix has proudly announced that its tactical fantasy adventure Triangle Strategy has sold over one million copies. The Artdink-developed RPG launched on Nintendo Switch last spring, and recently received a sales boost thanks to the release of a PC port in October.
A turn-based tactical affair, Triangle Strategy is one of the more recent offerings from RPG veteran Tomoyo Asano, producer of such gems as Octopath Traveler and the Bravely Default franchise. The story concerns the war-torn continent of Nozelia, as three countries continue a violent conflict that has raged for some three decades. The player guides noble protagonist Serenoa Wolffort as they, (and their compatriots) attempt to negotiate the machinations of a world at war.
To celebrate the sales milestone, Square Enix has announced a limited-time 40% off sale for the PC edition, now live on Steam. So if you're yet to get involved in the power and politics of Triangle Strategy, now presents an opportunity for you to get into the thick of the action for almost half of the retail price! While the Nintendo Switch release is also mentioned in the tweet as being part of the discount, the eShop is currently listing this edition at full price.

Chocobo GP, Square Enix's adorable (and slightly controversial) kart racer is getting its Season 5 update today, bringing with it two new racers and a stage based on Midgar from Final Fantasy VII. However, the developer seems to have confirmed that today's update is the game's last major one, with changes to the game's operating model going forward.
In a notice shared on Square's website, "Season 5 will be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the Chocobo GP mode". Sales of Mythril, the in-game currency, have also been suspended with today's update. You'll still be able to spend the Mythril you've earned up to 00:00 on 6th January 2023 JST (that's 10am on 5th January 2023 EST, or 3pm GMT on the 5th January), but after this date, your Mythril will become invalid and the in-game Mythril shop will be closed.

During yesterday's House of Indies broadcast, Nintendo announced that Hopoo Games' Risk of Rain Returns will be coming to the Switch platform in 2023, alongside its previously announced PC release.
Published by Gearbox, Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered and enhanced edition of the smash hit 2013 platformer, initially devised by two Washington University students using Gamemaker development software. Players take part in a challenging race against time, as stranded space explorers who must quickly and efficiently mount a defense against enormous waves of aliens and monsters. Simple in concept but hugely compelling, Risk of Rain would go on to sell over four million copies and be the recipient of several awards within the creative sphere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXNUXEfNvc
Risk of Rain Returns is a fully revised version of the original game, which features remastered visuals, (well, as much as you can "remaster" 8-bit graphics), 15 unique Survivor classes, 10 run-altering Artifacts, and fully overhauled multiplayer modes — featuring support for one-to-four players in online and local co-op action. While the game itself is now approaching its 10th anniversary, the Risk of Rain gameplay remains as frenzied and engrossing today as it was a decade ago. Time to get lost, all over again.
Risk of Rain Returns launches in 2023 on PC and Nintendo Switch.

Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.
We've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

Unsurprisingly, the game has been rated E10+, with warnings of Fantasy Violence and Mild Suggestive Themes (thanks, Go Nintendo). This places the game in exactly the same position as its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, which received the same rating back in 2017.

Fallout 76 has had a wild ride since its release...wow, over four years ago?! It's crazy to think how many things have changed since then, Fallout 76 included! It's gone from one of the biggest AAA disasters in recent memory to a respectable main/side game for many. This week, Bethesda released a "2022 retrospective" of sorts, complete with an infographic.
As is usually the case with these things, the info therein ranges from useful to silly. The main stat is that 13.5 million players engaged with the game in 2022 (keep in mind it's on Game Pass, and was offered for free several times): and from there, it gets a little more inside baseball.
If you play the game, you might find some of the other useless stats humorous, like the thumbs up taking the crown as the most popular emote, or the fact that there's been 2.9 million nukes dropped. Oh, and that folks prefer forest locations for setting up their camps/home base. "Boiled water" taking the top spot as the most prepared food/drink (combined!) is also funny to me.
With the massive Pitt update in the rear view and the new season afoot, folks are wondering what 2023 has in store for Fallout 76. Hopefully it still includes some combination of free access via Game Pass, as well as a healthy mix of smaller/bigger patches.
A great big Fallout 76 2022 recap:

Inti Creates has announced that its incoming release Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is just about ready to unleash its flurry of pixelated horror on the world. The Gothic anime actioner will launch on PC and console platforms on February 23, 2023.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge sees two young sisters venture into a foreboding castle on a quest to purge their school from its demonic presence. One or two players control older sister Shinobu, who is locked and loaded with a crazy arsenal of long-range weaponry, and her younger sibling Maya, who has mastered the deadly art of... erm... origami. Combining the destructive capabilities of the former with the precision and adaptation of the latter, our two heroes will head deeper into the grim locale, battling a gallery of monsters, ghoulies, and terrifying and unholy boss characters.

Grim Guardians: Demon Purge looks to combine the run-and-gun action of the 1990s with the classic Gothic overtones of the Castlevania series, dressed up in a pleasing anime cheese aesthetic. An array of secrets, weapons, and spells await, while a "Style" based scoring system will reward those who utilize a sense of fluidity in their relentless monster-mashing. Sporting delightful pixel-based visuals and classic arcade sound, Grim Guardians simply looks like good, unabashed fun, particularly in co-op, and has quickly found its way onto my radar for the first quarter of the coming year.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 23, 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

In case you missed it, Sonic Frontiers just recently put out a "2023 roadmap," and there's a lot on it. Before we actually get to the new year though there's a bit of free DLC to be had: including a "Holiday Cheer" Christmas suit.
As confirmed by the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, the DLC suit is out today, on top of the prior Monster Hunter DLC. If you need a rundown of how all this skin DLC works (it's not intuitive), we have a full breakdown here.

As a reminder, here's what the Sonic Frontiers 2023 roadmap looks like
Update 1: Juke Box, Photo Mode, New Challenge Modes
Update 2: Sonic's Birthday celebration, Open Zone Challenge, New Koco
Update 3: Playable Characters (Tails, Knuckles, Amy), and "new story"
If the team can fix a lot of the technical issues plaguing Sonic Frontiers, it should have a really, really long tail: uncharacteristically long, in fact. Folks have already taken to Sonic Frontiers more so than a lot of other modern 3D Sonic games, so more content and fixes will only help its case. Until all of the major stuff rolls out, we can mess around with the minor cosmetic DLC.

If you picked up 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on Switch earlier this year, the GrimGrimoire might be your next foray into Vanillaware's beautiful back catalogue.

It's been a busy week for Falcom, but the legendary Japanese developer has even more news to share for its 2023 plans. In an interview with Famitsu (translated by Ryoktuya2089 via Gematsu), Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo said that the company wants to release three "refined" titles in total, following the announcement of Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana.
Previously, Kondo has gone on record stating that up to the end of September 2023, Falcom wants to release three titles for the Switch. Ys Memoire, the enhanced rerelease of the 2010 PSP action RPG Ys: The Oath in Felghana, is due to launch on the Switch in Spring 2023, meaning the remaining two titles Kondo is teasing will likely be coming to Switch. Whether these are other refined Ys titles or not, we're yet to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven't played enough to give you a big wot I think. It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.
Yaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.

The flaw resulted in numerous complaints from users and led to several class-action lawsuits being filed against Nintendo, leading to Nintendo improving the controller's design but open admitting that instances of drift would be "unavoidable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pale imitation.
Described by developer Condradical as "Paper Mario + Undertale" on the game's Kickstarter page, The Outbound Ghost garnered some attention with its aesthetic and gameplay along with its premise: the residents of the town of Outbound all quite suddenly died. Many of them have lingering burdens that keep them from moving onto the afterlife. You initially assume the role of an amnesiac ghost as he explores the town, meeting its spectral residents and uncovering a bit by bit what exactly happened. It sounds grim, sure, but it’s all wrapped up in a cutesy package that never devolves too much into the macabre. The game has finally arrived (though not without drama between Conradical and publisher Digerati) and can be played on a Nintendo platform, as all papery RPGs should.
If you’ve played Paper Mario before, the gameplay loop is quite similar. While exploring the areas around Outbound, touching a malevolent enemy in the overworld will trigger a turn-based battle. In battle you control four of a selection of figments of your own psyche – Solitude, Spite, Comradery, and so on – that manifest themselves as party members. Attacks are reflex-based, with an improperly timed button press resulting in a miss and a perfectly timed one increasing damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While our RPS Advent Calendar has been counting down to the reveal of our favourite game of the year, another advent calendar has brought far spookier treats. The low-fi indie developers of the Haunted PS1 community have another Madvent Calendar this year, offering another 24 small horror games and oddities released daily. So far, these have ranged from an extreme snowboarding murder game to a pleasant little online social network where you leave messages for other people by decorating plants and plaques in a sunny courtyard.

PlatinumGames has announced that its standard shmup from earlier this year, Sol Cresta, is having a whole new wave of content added to it in the form of DLC packages and a free update.
While the no-cost additions focus on expanding the game's Caravan Mode as well as the usual tweaks to the player experience, the DLC is all about the roster. Made up of three individual purchases (or one bundle for those who want to splash out all at once), the downloadable content adds in fighters from Sol Cresta's 1980s predecessors: Moon Cresta, Terra Cresta and Terra Cresta II: Mandler no Gyakushuu.

For now, the keycards needed to enter Building 21 are disabled.

After releasing back in March of this year, Square Enix has announced that TRIANGLE STRATEGY has now sold over one million copies worldwide (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
For a game that managed to shift 800,000 units in its first two weeks of release, this is a slowing number, it is true. However, for a genre which is not as popular today as it once was and a game which was exclusive to Switch for the most part (it later received a Steam release in October), one million is still an impressive number.

Kirby is still kind of celebrating his 30th anniversary. Following on from last week's Tetris 99 event, the pink puff has now got a new First 4 Figures statue. It's officially known as the "We Love Kirby mini metal statue".
Fortunately, it's not quite as expensive as the company's usual offerings, priced at just $65.99 USD (or your regional equivalent) for early birds. After this period it will cost $76.99. Pre-orders are now open, it's estimated to release in Q2 2023, and there will also be silver and gold variants made available at "later dates".

Yet does Super Mario RPG count as a Mario game? Does Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker? Is Donkey Kong a Mario game? I know I'm not the first person to dive into this question, but it does impact this entire list. Not only are my opinions subject to debate (as they should be), the very qualifications of what belongs on the list can be contested.

Seasonal events in live service games are something I look forward to every year. Whether they're for the holiday season at the end of the year, or the best time of the year aka spooky season, it's always a good time to collect all the themed cosmetics and jump into a special game mode that will only be around for so long. These days, pretty much every live service game worth its salt has a holiday event to speak of, and with so many great ones out there (and a few that deserve a lump of coal), I had to do what we games journalists do — I had to rank them.
So here's my list of the live service holiday events of 2022. When it came to the games I chose, it came down to which titles I play, are intrigued by, or believe to generally have a big audience…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And the "biggest 3rd Party Game Pass launch ever"
Over on the Game Pass charts (on both PC and console), I noticed that High on Life was jumping up quickly after launch. But today, Microsoft fully confirmed my inkling: the game is a bona fide success on Game Pass.
The Squanch Games release was apparently "Xbox Game Pass’ biggest launch of 2022," as well as "the biggest 3rd party Game Pass launch of all time, and the biggest release of a single player-only game in the service’s history." Where does Microsoft actually get those stats? They're based on the "number of hours played in the first five days of release." In both an email to Destructoid and on the Xbox Wire blog itself, Microsoft uses the phrase "millions of players" to describe the userbase playing right now.
Despite my misgivings with the game, as I pointed out in my review, High on Life might be the the most ideal Game Pass game to date (especially since it has a $60 MSRP). It's so janky that you'd possibly be pissed if you spent $60 on it, but on a lark as an "extra" on Game Pass, it's great to dive into with no context as patches roll out for it.
Not only that, but given that so much of High on Life is based on Roiland's subjective sense of humor, you may not even enjoy the entire vibe altogether. While many of those jokes are hit or miss, one of the best things about it is the "90s adventure game" feeling it has, Easter eggs and meta-references and all. I wish it had a bit more polish, but it's great to see Squanch Games getting a win either way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just Deserts
Bandai Namco has offered up a little more information on its previously teased "Project Sand Land" endeavor, focusing on the short-lived but well-received manga by Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama.
According to the publisher, Project Sand Land consists of several creative endeavors, produced by a variety of well-known manga, anime, and game producers. The first and foremost of these tributes will be a full "visual adaptation" of the original 2000 manga series. This cinematic project will be produced by veteran anime studios Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and ANIMA, and is scheduled to premiere in 2023. Bandai Namco's insistence on referring to the production as a "visual adaptation" rather than a "film" or an "anime" leaves a few questions up in the air. but we'll just have to wait and see.
You can check out a teaser trailer for the adaptation below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--plyeEv4Ag&t=53s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
As we previously recanted, Sand Land was dystopian adventure series set within a world that had become almost entirely desert, with water becoming the single most important form of currency. With his local town dry as a bone, aging sheriff Rao teams up with Prince of Demons Beelzebub (no, really), and impish mischief maker Thief on an odyssey to uncover the location of the legendary Phantom Lake and return a source of hydration to his hometown.
While the visual adaptation is the only endeavor revealed by Bandai Namco so far, the publisher suggests that it has other creative projects in the works, with more reveals to be made across 2023, given the studio's interest, it's not hard to imagine that there may be a Sand Land video game in the works. For now, we're just going to have to hold fast and keep our tanks gassed up and ready to rock.
In the meantime, you can check out the official Project Sand Land website right here.

The launch of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard back in 2017 was a revelation for fans of the franchise. After the lukewarm reception to Resident Evil 6 and decidedly poor reception to Umbrella Corps, Capcom realised that it had to try something different. With its creepy mansion, limited ammo, and exceptionally dangerous enemies, Resident Evil 7 was both a loving homage to the series’ roots and a brave new direction that would significantly inform its immediate future.

In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox.

When I first covered the rumor that Square Enix was reaching well into its own past to dig up long-lost Super Famicom release Live A Live, I will admit that, despite being pleased with the preservation element, I didn't really think that the endeavor would amount to much. After all, various '90s classics have been resurrected time and again, only to fall short of their former glories or, in the worst cases, miss the point entirely.
But Live A Live was something different. Live A Live, launched in 1994 at the tail-end of the 16-bit reign, was both ambitious and way ahead of its time. The unknown release featured a slew of characters and worlds, multiple backstories, and a fascinating chrono-conundrum set against the backdrop of eight different time periods — from prehistory and …]]></summary>

Martial arts brawler Sifu is heading to new platforms in the new year, and it'll have a new mode too. Developer Sloclap is bringing Sifu to Xbox and Steam in March 2023, as well as a new Arenas mode.
Up to this point, Sifu has been available on PlayStation consoles, PC via Epic, and the Nintendo Switch. When it arrives on Xbox and Steam, it'll go for $39.99. That will include the free updates the game has received in the time since launch, including the recent fall update with a Replay Editor and the upcoming Arenas mode update.
Arenas mode, which will be part of a free update this spring, will add nine new maps with special challenges. Completing the arena challenges will unlock new modifiers, as well as add some alternative moves to the protagonist's arsenal. It's always nice to have some extra tricks up your sleeve when enacting your vengeance, right? The Arenas will also unlock new cheats and special new outfits, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW_4aIEV3Q
On a quest for revenge
Sifu was one of the earlier hits of 2022, arriving just at the start of February. Following a martial arts student whose master is slain by a rival organization. As the student, you go on a quest for vengeance, fueled by a magical artifact that lets you spring back to life at the cost of years of your life.
It's a really fun brawler, and fitting follow-up to Sloclap's previous game Absolver. With the new updates, it seems like a lot has been added to freshen up the experience, and a special Arenas mode is a no-brainer for Sifu. Looks like there will be a good reason to get back into the brawl next year.

Although Overwatch doesn't seem to have the same cachet it once enjoyed in the Overwatch 2 era, it's still chugging along with the seasonal model: which includes new heroes. This holiday update is a little less exciting, but it does involve a nearly-free skin.
Blizzard has announced today that the Legendary Gingerbread Bastion skin will cost one Overwatch 2 coin (the main currency of the new iteration of the game). The promotion will run from today through January 3. You can check out the skin in the header image, and see if it's even worth your time logging in (or installing it at all, depending on your reaction to the semi-sequel).
I guess it's a good thing Bastion was fixed
You may recall that late in the year, Bastion was busted, and was taken out of the rotation completely. As a recap, Blizzard posted the following Twitter message on October 10: "Bastion and Torbjörn will be taking a quick trip to the workshop while we iron out a few bugs in their ability kits! Bastion will be unavailable in all modes during this time, while Torbjörn will still be playable in Quick Play." Bastion in particular was able to exploit his ultimate, leading to a swift recall of the hero.
Bastion was added back to the game on October 25, and joins a line of heroes (among other things like at least one map) that were removed from the game due to bugs.

Day 2 of Nintendo's House of Indies holiday event is upon us, and the team is opening Door #2. Two more shadowdrops have arrived, as well as two announcements of upcoming games slated for 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qXjO6eQm34
First up, the play-it-now games for today. The Captain is a new narrative adventure from Sysiac Games and Tomorrow Corporation. You play a lost science officer from the space fleet, trying to work their way back home with some precious info. Lots of choices wait to be made, as well as big space battles to get caught up in.
If penguins are more your style, The Punchuin is a new game from The Touryst team Shin'en. You play as a penguin who punches things, and is trying to see all there is to see on Punch Mountain. It's part match-three puzzle, and part-charming exploration and adventure, but all punchy penguin.
Forecast calls for more rain
Two more games got revealed today too, locking in for a 2023 launch window. The first is The Gecko Gods, a puzzle platformer from Inresin and Super Rare Originals. It asks, "what if a gecko could explore a mysterious and dangerous island?" It's all in the pursuit of saving their friend, who I hope is also a small and adorable gecko. That's set to arrive in 2023.
A popular roguelike is also on the way back, too. Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered version of the original Risk of Rain from Hopoo Games and Gearbox Publishing. It looks to have all the 2D chaos of the original, but with a new coat of paint and apparently new ways to play in store too. The rain returns in 2023.
There are still three days left this week in Nintendo's House of Indies advent calendar. Tune back in tomorrow morning for the next bout of indie surprises for the Switch.

This update is called Arenas, and as the name suggests, it adds nine new maps that feature combat challenges. Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor. 


Sifu is now available on PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC via the Epic Game Store. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

Sometimes, giving out awards for the best game of the year can feel a bit tedious, because there will be one title that stood head and shoulders above the rest. While in 2022, it may have been easy to predict that a game like Elden Ring would take home our pick for the best PlayStation title of the year, the PC category was a real toss up — of all the categories our staff voted on, the votes for the PC category were by far the most evenly spread. The nominees included heavy-hitters like Signalis, Citizen Sleeper, and NORCO, just to name a few, and while any one of them would have been a worthy winner in the eyes of the Destructoid team, Vampire Survivors is the PC title that came out on top this year.

Publisher Kitbox Games, in alliance with developer Sundae Month, has announced that the very silly but entirely wholesome title Pupperazzi will come wagging its tail on Nintendo Switch in early 2023, following from its release on PC and Xbox One back in January of this year.
Pupperazzi's concept is utterly delightful in its simplicity: You are a budding social media hound (pun fully intended) who is searching for internet stardom via the medium of doggie photos. Camera in hand, the player simply strolls around towns, beaches, and cityscapes, getting snap-happy on any and all four-legged friends that cross their path. Build up a portfolio of the finest puppy pics online and then bask in the glory of upvotes and having your pics turned into NFTs (That last bit doesn't happen).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j_0yGFPSQo&ab_channel=KitfoxGames
Pupperazzi features a wide variety of Good Boys and Girls, including terriers, pugs, labradors, shibas, and so many more. And, when not taking great photos, you can pet your new doggie pals, play fetch, dress them up (if you're terrible), arrange parties, and enjoy various other activities. Don't forget to take them *checks notes* skateboarding. As you receive acclaim for your pupperazzi skills, you'll also get the opportunity to upgrade your camera equipment — buying new filters, lenses, and effects. It's all very charming and wholesome, and most certainly a stress-free way to unwind on a lazy afternoon.
Pupperazzi launches in early 2023 on Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PC and Xbox One.

As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian's founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there's still a lot to come.

Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

A new survey rolled out by Xbox suggests that the publisher may be entertaining the idea of cheaper, ad-based tiers for its hugely successful game streaming subscription service, Xbox Game Pass.
The survey, which was noted by the eagle-eyed video game fans over on Resetera, looks to garner interest in some hypothetical new versions of the subscription service. One example offered is "Xbox Game Pass Lite", which would offer access to the standard Game Pass library of new and classic games, but would play ads before each game launches, and would limit access to download only (so no streaming).

This suggested service would also include multiplayer access, with an example price of around five dollars. If such a service were to exist, it would almost …]]></summary>

It's Christmas time, and that means it's the season of giving...and getting! I assume some of you out there are gifting hardware to relatives or immediate family members, and with modern hardware comes a certain degree of responsibility. Yep, updates! This Reddit thread from Letmeplat reminded me of something really important: consider updating your hardware before you gift it.
Often times, Christmas day servers explode with demand
I think it was the 3DS era that I started thinking about updating gifts ahead of time. It had gotten to the point where nearly everything needed a hefty amount of firmware updates: on top of game updates. I think the worst experience I've ever had with this was updating my PS3 after a long hiatus. The PSN would take hours to download each update, and would turn around and download an update on top of that update. It was exhausting, and would just leave it running all day.
As an extra tip: if your console comes with a free game like Mario Kart, consider updating that too. Or as a matter of fact, consider updating any game you're gifting. With few exceptions (like The Witcher 3 fitting on one Switch cart), many games require huge updates to even play, which could mean wait times, or bugged out servers preventing someone from downloading a crucial day one patch.
Of course, you could also leave it to the giftee to do it, especially if you're aiming to give them a sealed copy. It's your choice!

The sequel to Star Wars: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, was announced some time ago, but developer Respawn Entertainment has remained mostly silent on what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wumpa'd.
Mobile game giant King has announced that it is shutting service for its microtransaction-fuelled title Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! Originally launched in March of 2021 on iOS and Android platforms, Crash and pals will make their final dash in February 2023, when the servers are shut off permanently.
"Crash fans, it’s with a heavy heart that we inform you on February 16, 2023 we will terminate service for Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!" wrote King in a message on Facebook. "It has meant so much to bring your favourite Crash characters to life and we've sincerely loved making this game. Thank you for spending your time with us and we hope you will join us in one of our many other games."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KETsS3nkwBw&ab_channel=IGN
The in-game store is closed, effective immediately, and players are encouraged to use up any of the "Purple Crystals", (On the Run's in-game currency), before the closing date. The news has come as something of a surprise to some in the runner's community, as there had been whispers that On the Run! might actually have been preparing for a full relaunch in the new year. The game had previously been delisted from stores, with the developer saying that the removal was due to a "bug".
Dedicated fans of the title have also expressed dismay that a game they have spent money on over the past 23 months will suddenly be rendered completely unusable. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the risk that comes with frequent spending within modern service titles. Many, many mobile titles have pulled down the blinds on the player communities, regardless of whether the fans are financially invested, and refunds are rarely forthcoming, if ever.
Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! is not the first game to call it quits in the early going, and it absolutely will not be the last.

Early this morning, Capcom held its latest Capcom TV live stream, in which we got our first proper glimpse at some new Street Fighter 6 characters in action. Clumsily strutting their stuff for the home audience were newcomers Marisa, Manon, and J.P. who joined series veterans Dhalsim, Dee Jay, and E. Honda for some impromptu slugfests.
Now, without being mean, it must be said that these matches are hardly what you'd call "deep dive character showcases" — featuring a helluva lot of wild button mashing and endless jumping — but the matches do give us the opportunity to check out some of the incoming characters normals and specials, along with their respective intro animations, walkouts, win poses, and, perhaps most importantly of all, their "Game Face" options!

After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Do not be afraid to die." That's the advice of Haemimont Games' CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to "challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge," Dyankov tells me. "Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable." I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.

As a result, video games are incredibly complex and more prone to delays than movies, books, or TV shows. So just because a game is set to come out in 2023 doesn’t mean it actually will…

The deal involved FTX paying many millions of dollars to League Of Legends developers Riot, who have only received $6.25 million of the $12.5 million FTX were supposed to cough up in 2022. This is on account of FTX being a) bankrupt and b) formerly lead by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested last week in The Bahamas. It is hard not to LoL.

I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel's Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it's more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series' first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here's a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a "small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023," but notes that quantities will be "extremely limited" so if you're interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix's blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

That’s today, if you’ve not checked your advent calendar yet. This one’s got my attention because I’m a sucker for a fishing minigame, something Sable added in a free update just last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knight Witch deserves more attention than it's getting. It's a Metroidvania shmup in which you fly about, blast enemies with guns, and cast spells from a deck of cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As has seemingly become a yearly tradition in my gaming calendar, I have ended up finishing 2022 in much the same way I finished 2021: reviewing yet another Final Fantasy VII game. Last year, it was the PC release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this year it's Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, a remaster of the original game's PSP prequel. As such, I've been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some 'downtime' to 'hang' with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. 
Drop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more.

I'll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you're anything like me you'll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going "wheeee!".
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you'll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you'll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company's long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it's because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it's been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.


If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it's a shame the FPS side can't match it.

The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not. As is the excellent "EUURRYAAAARRGH!" death-cry that protagonist Kyle Katarn makes as he takes one blaster bolt too many and collapses onto the ground.

It was kind of like the Neanderthal to the Steam Deck’s Homo sapiens, existing for a brief few years before being discontinued back in 2019. Steam Controllers were an unusual evolutionary offshoot of the by-then fairly standardised controller layout, with funky clickable trackpads taking the place of thumbsticks. Well, Valve’s designers seem to be up for reviving the concept in some form. At least, that’s what they’ve told The Verge in an interview about the Steam Deck’s first nine months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:

Earlier this year the MPA admitted that around 10,000 domains had already been removed but today's figure is likely to be much higher. Takedown notices on the Lumen Database and a report published in Lithuania cast additional light on a stealthy but massive piracy deindexing program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s well documented that creativity can help quell the waves of stormy mental health seas. Hours of documentaries chronicle how artists expressed their struggles through brushstrokes, or how an actor agonised over creating an accurate character to counterbalance their imposter syndrome or anxiety. It’s unlikely many creatives have found “refuge” in a 27 year old retro game engine - but that’s exactly how Dan Douglas talks about his sprawling mod for Duke Nukem 3D.

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled w…]]></summary>

I've no way of knowing if that's what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month "upgrading all copies" of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC. 

If it was what they thought, it hasn't worked. Players report that Re-Elected isn't an upgrade at all, but that it has broken their save games, their mods, and introduced new launch and crash bugs to the nine-year-old game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


"What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we've been in absolute awe of the work of our peers," Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. "Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here's to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall." 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, "Following the events of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel's Spider-Man series." 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales. 
Do you think Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PS5 next fall or do you think it will be delayed beyond that? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector's edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

        <updated>2022-12-15T14:00:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We'll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it's somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

        <updated>2022-12-15T13:01:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village's VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn't just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


"A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters' journey takes full advantage of the headset's advanced features," a press release reads. "VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever."
Capcom says the platform's PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
"These [controllers] represent Ethan's famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game," Capcom writes in a press release. "Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Developers CD Projekt Red now say they're "actively investigating" the problems, and will update us on what they find "as soon as possible".

I say hippies, I mean bloodthirsty thugs who happen to like psychedelics. 
The update has also increased security for the popular Cayo Perico heist, which was one of the main ways people earned their money, so folks are understandably grumpy. Maybe they can sell some acid instead?

The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach's Castle, Bowser's Castle, Toad's Cafe, Yoshi's Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios' rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we've experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos' adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…]]></summary>

Though it's still quite stuttery and it appears AMD FSR is causing crashes. Less hooray! The original article, based on test results taken before the hotfix, continues below:

Earlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.

The event sees Crytek's excellent multiplayer cowboy sneak 'em up periodically set fire to big parts of each map, where you blow up creepy bleedy statues for points that unlock new weapons and traits. There's one that makes you invisible to monsters, which sounds ridiculously powerful - which is probably why the traits will only be in play until the event ends on January 15th.

Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday's delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below: 
Each of these aired during today's Hogwarts Legacy showcase.

Patch 9 for Baldur's Gate III is out now, adding playable Paladins and increasing the level cap to 5. In true D&D spirit, that's when you get the good stuff, like the ability to fly or summon zombies. Heck, I think you can summon zombies and make *them* fly. It's a whole new world.
Come watch the developers natter all about it in a festive edition of one of their Panels From Hell. One of them is dressed up as a knitting reindeer, and they just announced critical role chap Matthew Mercer will voice a new character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath's exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you've dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

And that's because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn't show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I'd argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn't a life investment, and that's rad.

I thought it had potential, but it's difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you've got to go on is footage they'd prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I'm excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe's CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a'knockin...

More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There's a look at Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge, Yoshi's Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood's video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can't wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood's Nintendo-themed land would be opening in "early 2023." Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…]]></summary>

The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn't see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator's post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there's a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


"I personally can't conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending," Kamiya told IGN Japan. "I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company."
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks "internally about how we could make nine of them." He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, "I'm not going to do anything that will betray the players." 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…]]></summary>

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series. After roughly two hours of playing Odyssey, I am rearing to jump back into the anime, and that’s the best compliment I can give the game. It doesn’t hurt that Odyssey is shaping u…]]></summary>

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020.

Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below.

Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it's another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom's Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative," according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it's due out sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities."
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.]]></summary>

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The Collector's Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur's Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur's Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector's Edition certificate. The Collector's Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira's return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur's Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a "very positive" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll "cleanse the world of its evil and corruption." 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
