The Rune Factory series, a spin-off of Story of Seasons, combines action/RPG combat with its sibling’s farming and social elements. Now, almost a decade after Rune Factory 4’s debut on 3DS, a new Rune Factory game is just around the corner as a Switch exclusive on March 22. We chatted with director Shiro Maekawa to give you an idea of what you can expect, from the fun festivals to powering up Link Attacks with other town members.  
It’s been a long road to Rune Factory 5. Many fans were worried about the series’ future, especially with Neverland closing. Can you discuss the journey to get this long-awaited entry off the ground?

As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Nintendo has been continuing its promotion of online and competitive play in some key titles, albeit without blowing the doors off and gaining a lot of attention. Particularly through the Nintendo Versus account it highlights frequent competitions in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Splatoon 2, in particular.
The next MK8 Deluxe North American Open has had a bit of extra promotion from the broader Nintendo of America account, no doubt tapping into expectation for this week's release of DLC through the 'Booster Course Pass'.

Forspoken, the upcoming title from Luminous Productions and this month’s cover story, largely takes place in the magical world of Athia. Unfortunately, the realm has seen better days, as a creeping corruption has flooded the once-prosperous land. The Break, as the destructive fog is known in the game, has the power to corrupt anything it touches. Humans become hostile and mindless, animals morph into monsters, and even the land itself takes on a bizarre appearance.
While there have been several trailers for Forspoken, much of them take place in a dry, desert-looking region. This land is just outside Cipal, the last d…]]></summary>

The internet's a funny place. For years there was wailing and gnashing of teeth as the mobile-only Mario Kart Tour got all-new tracks and much-loved classics — "bring that content to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe!", we demanded. Then the Booster Course Pack is announced and lots of (probably the same) people said "What!? You're using Mario Kart Tour content? Ugh, that's so lazy".
Well, that's one set of perspectives your humble scribe has seen and the personal response has been a shrug of the shoulders. So what if Nintendo is re-using content from a mobile game? If it has been optimised to run at 60fps and look shiny on Switch, then that's marvellous. Sure, it's an easy-win approach, but it's also 48 tracks across nearly two years, doubling the number of courses in the game. And also, we're not all avid Mario Kart Tour players, either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. 
As reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. 
However, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. 
“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” 
For more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that.

The Kirby series' 30th anniversary is fast approaching, as is the release of the pink puffball's next game, Kirby and the Forgotten Land. And it looks like we're going to have a big music festival to celebrate one of Nintendo's most recognisable, and cutest, characters.
For a moment, we were ready to be disappointed. Nintendo UK shared the Grand Opening from the series' 25th Anniversary concert. And, as good as that concert was, we thought that was all we were going to get. Luckily, just a little while later, the official Kirby account shared its plans for the round guy's next big celebration (thanks, Nibel).

Fortiche's League animations have been better than Riot's games so yeah, go on, I'll take more. They're currently working on a second season of Arcane.

Its quiet, meditative approach to gameplay and emphasis on multiplayer that promotes connection rather than competition was, for the time, especially novel. The game accrued a massive fan base, countless awards, and recognition from not only the game industry but the art world at large. 
More personally, it completely changed composer Austin Wintory's life. Nowadays, he's one of the more recognizable names in video game soundtracks.

Reggie Fils-Amie was at SXSW this weekend to talk about the current disruption in the entertainment industry market, and during his talk at the show, he was asked about his thoughts on a number of things, inclusing Facebook's metaverse.
Naturally, at that same talk, Nintendo of America's former President was also questioned about GameStop. Reggie served on the retailer's Board of Directors from April 2020 to June 2021. GameStop was another of the many companies hit hard by the pandemic and the increase in digital sales. Reggie joined the board hoping that he could help the company out. "The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant GameStop," he said about his appointment on Twitter back in 2020. "I look forward to being a part of GameStop’s corporate board and helping to make this happen."

When asked if OtherSide Entertainment’s work on the threequel had come to an end, Spector said there’s not much more clarification he can give at this point.

Hogwarts Legacy, the mysterious and long-awaited RPG set in the Harry Potter universe, will finally get its first gameplay showing in a new State of Play airing this week. 
PlayStation tweeted the news this morning stating that the presentation airs Thursday, March 17 at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. There’s no word on how long it will be, but the tweet refers to it as an “extended look,” so that hopefully means we’re in for a deep dive on everything Hogwarts Legacy entails.

March 14, 2022
Hogwarts Legacy was first announced during the PlayStation 5 showcase in 2020. The open-world action RPG casts you in the role of a Hogwarts student and is being developed by Avalanche Software. Author J.K. Rowling has not been directly involved in the game’s development, which had been a concern to some fans in the wake of her controversial statements regarding the transgender community in recent years. Hogwarts Legacy was initially scheduled to launch in 2021, but in January of that year, it was delayed to 2022. 
Although Hogwarts Legacy has mainly been shown on PlayStation stages and is coming to PS5 and PS4, it’s also launching on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        Switch
				
Publisher:
      Nintendo
			
Developer:
      Sora, Ltd
      
Release:
                      	December 7, 2018
			
            
Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director behind Nintendo’s mega-hit Super Smash Bros. franchise, is back from a long break after completing development on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it seems. And while he’s back to work, a new statement from the director teases that what he’s working on might not be a video game. 
News of Sakurai’s return to work comes from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo, which reports that Sakurai has revealed that he is, in fact, working on something. As for what, we might find out in the near future but Sakurai hints that it might not be related to gaming in any way. 
“I have been away for a while now, but I am working on something,” Sakurai told Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo. “My eyes may be a little tired. You may see me in the near future in a place that has nothing to do with game production. You may or may not be able to see me. I hope to see you again in the future. Thank you very much for your time.” 
As you can see in the statement above, Sakurai seems to be dropping hints to his fans that they shouldn’t be expecting a new game from him anytime soon. Perhaps he’s working on something that’s very behind-the-scenes, or maybe he’s jumped industries and is now working in movie production or something like that. Only time will tell. 
For now, read about Sakurai’s journey to get Sora from Kingdom Hearts, the final fighter in Ultimate, in the game, and then check out this story about how Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out despite that. Read about how Sakurai thinks the next game in the Smash Bros. series would need a smaller roster and less dependence on his own vision after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We have Persona 4 at home".
Welcome to Atlus, Switch fans, the company that really doesn’t want you to play any mainline Persona games, but does want you to play their canon sequels. Last year, we got Persona 5 Strikers, a surprisingly great Warriors-style follow up to the seminal Persona 5. This year, we’re getting Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, a *checks notes* remaster of a fighting game that serves as a sequel to both Persona 3 and Persona 4. As oddly positioned as this project may feel, we’re happy to report that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax proves itself to be a competent fighter on Switch, one that we think will appeal both to fans of the Persona brand and to fighting game newcomers.
First off, let’s recap what’s all included here. Persona 4 Arena Ultimax packs in quite a lot of content, featuring the stories of both the original P4A and P4AU alongside all the DLC from across those two games. This means that all the additional fighters, a staggering amount of cosmetic options for each of them, and an additional story mode have all been thrown in. Behind the scenes, this is also including all of the ‘2.5’ content from the Japanese exclusive arcade release of P4AU, which integrated a bunch of balancing changes to make for an overall better feeling experience. In short, this is the most feature-rich version of P4AU yet, and it all comes now with the benefit of being portable.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hits theaters in just a few weeks, on April 8, and today, Paramount Pictures has released the final trailer for the sequel. 
If you’ve been watching the trailers for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as of late, then you know Paramount and Sega are unsurprisingly pushing the return of Robotnik and the introduction of Tails and Knuckles to the fray. Also, unsurprisingly, Robotnik, Tails, Knuckles, and of course, Sonic look great in this final trailer.

During the interview, Reggie — now non-executive director for Spin Master Inc. and Brunswick Corp. — was asked about his thoughts on the metaverse, the ephemeral 'network' of 3D worlds touted to link us all digitally and socially in fascinating new ways... maybe. Or perhaps it'll be more like Second Life but the Batman and Spider-Man chilling the beans together. Yes, in the future IP lawyers will surely run everything.

As you can see it has its own spin on the genre, opting for a timeline UI approach and a battlefield that evolves and keeps you on your toes; it'll also have over 140 cards to obtain and will be a premium title (not free-to-play with microtransactions).

Even if you love Final Fantasy games, expect to feel like a stranger in a strange land when playing Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. This violent retelling of the original Final Fantasy game from 1987 largely sidesteps the series’ adventurous spirit and heartfelt mysticism to focus on muscle, attitude, and everything extreme. Square Enix labels this remake as a “hardcore action/RPG,” an apt description for a game that rarely relents in its aggression.

Metroidvania fans can often rejoice at the offerings they get on Switch, and it looks like another one might be coming our way! F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch has been rated for the console in Taiwan, as highlighted by Gematsu.
The game stars an anthropomorphic ex-pilot bunny who must make his way through Torch City. We know that sounds cute and cuddly, but F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is anything but. Boasting difficult platforming and tough-as-nails arcade-style combat, this is one Metroidvania that will get your cottontail in a spin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It's real now".
Reflect on previous Nintendo generations, and you might remember mock-ups of portable GameCube handhelds inspired by the Game Boy Advance SP. If you've ever wanted a real version of something like this, well...that's exactly what console modder and YouTuber 'GingerOfOz' has created.
The modder has been able to shrink this mock-up down to a Game Boy Advance SP-style handheld unit. In truth, it's actually running a "trimmed" Wii motherboard inside of it, which obviously supports Nintendo's library of GameCube games.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Season 3 officially comes to a close with our discussion of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. 
Released August 22, 2017 – less than a year after Uncharted 4 – Lost Legacy puts Chloe Frazer in the starring role for the first time. She's not alone, however; former antagonist Nadine Ross partners with her, leading to an odd-couple-style treasure hunt that may be shorter than Uncharted 4 but was just as entertaining. Prior to this, Naughty Dog batted around other combinations of characters for this adventure including Sully and Sam Drake. How did the team turn The Lost Legacy around so quickly after A Thief's End? What's the deal with that "wimpy" train explosion? Listen here to hear the answers to these questions and more. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), and former Game Informer intern O'Dell Harmon Jr. (@ODellHarmonJr) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Uncharted game to date. Tune to also find out the game series that will be the topic for Season 4! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

This week's episode is hitting a little later than usual. The reason? Our local comic shops in Minnesota didn't get any Marvel comic books last week. We felt the show would be a little light without them, so we held off until we could get our hands on those books. The wait was worth it: The first issue of Strange is an absolute delight and a fantastic direction for the Sorcerer Supreme to go in.
Most of this episode is dedicated to new comic book releases that hit this week and last. We also dive into The Batman, which I give a score and review to, and also discuss Gotham Knights' new release date!
If you would like to follow us on Twitter: Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) and Philip Hoff (@bnow23).
From Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week. Each episode also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.

WWE 2K22 launches today. For some fans, the best part of wrestling games is creating custom superstars or, better yet, real-life wrestlers not present in the game (or at least not yet in some cases). But no matter how visually accurate your Jon Moxley CAW is, he’s nothing without an entrance that at least comes close to emulating the real thing. Thankfully, WWE 2K22’s entrance creation features a number of animations from old stars and even those who have never stepped foot in WWE. The trick is knowing where to look. 
WWE games have traditionally labeled these entranc…]]></summary>

Forspoken is a story-heavy game with the narrative mainly tying into the central quest. But Forspoken is not a linear game, and with such a vast, open world, we wondered what happens if you step off the golden path. To satisfy our curiosity, we recently sat down with developer Luminous Productions and got our first look at the game’s various side activities and optional objectives you can find around the map. Besides seeing more of the magical parkour in action and noticing the plethora of crafting materials lying around the realm, the team walked us through crafting in Refuges, enhancing stats at Monuments, finding …]]></summary>

EA has released a new two-minute look at gameplay from its upcoming Dead Space Remake and it features a quick look at Isaac Clarke laying waste to a Necromorph. 
Revealed today during a special Dead Space Remake developer update stream focused on the title’s audio, this look at gameplay showcased a small snippet of protagonist Isaac walking around a very spooky section of the Ishimura before he’s attacked by a Necromorph. Fortunately, he has his newly-remade 211-V Plasma Cutter.

WWE 2K22’s long road to release stands as a redemption story as dramatic as any of the TV storylines. The series took a few years off to regroup following the trainwreck that was 2019’s 2K20, and the time away allowed it to learn some useful new holds.

The new engine strips away some of the complicated mechanics that made the pre…]]></summary>

And both have found their way into the MSI Raider GE76, that top-spec GPU getting paired with a fittingly top-spec CPU: the Core i9-12900HK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

Elden Ring is a hard game. It’s a From Software Soulsborne game so that’s no surprise. Be it a mouse and keyboard or a controller, bosses like Godrick the Grafted will undoubtedly give you some trouble in Elden Ring. 
Now, imagine fighting Godrick with some bananas. Like real edible bananas that you can find at any grocery store. Sounds impossible, right? Well, somehow it’s not because SuperLouis_64 on Twitter recently posted a video showing him do just that, as reported by Eurogamer. 
THE BANANA CONTROLLER WORKS 🍌
#ELDENRING pic.twitter.com/ZOjzYb8Sgo
March 8, 2022
As you can see in the video above, SuperLouis_64 plays Elden Ring with bananas as well as some of us do on intended controllers (better than me, at least – I’ll be honest). He seems to be using bananas on the bottom left to control his Tarnished’s movement while his right hand seems to use three bananas to control attacks and dodges. Of course, this is pure speculation because the official Banana control scheme for Elden Ring has not yet been released by From Software (we eagerly await the day, though). 
News of SuperLouis_64 tropical feat comes just days after someone beat Elden Ring in under three hours without dying a singe time. In other news, I am not as good at Elden Ring as I thought I was, it seems. 
If you need help in Elden Ring, Game Informer has you covered, though. Check out our guide on how to beat Godrick the Grafted and then read our guide on Elden Ring’s best rune farming location. After that, check out this guide on how to find Elden Ring’s best summon spirit, and then read about this tactic that will help you easily beat every boss in Elden Ring.

It launched in May 2021 in a sorry state and, while developers Frontier have been fixing it up, it's still a mess now. This week Frontier announced that to help focus their efforts on fixing Odyssey, they're cancelling the yet-unreleased console version. Good news for us on PC, I suppose, but oof! "This was not an easy decision to make, but it was made with the long-term future of Elite Dangerous in mind," Frontier frontman David Braben said.

Another month, another roundup of U.S. NPD numbers and not surprisingly, Elden Ring was the best-selling game of February. 
Elden Ring is also the best-selling game of 2022 year-to-date and what’s more is that it is secured the second-best launch month sales of any title in the past 12 months, coming in second only to last November’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. On top of that, after just one month on the U.S. video game market, Elden Ring is already ranked as the fifth best-selling game over the past year. It ranked first on both Xbox consoles and PC, coming in second on PlayStation hardware.…]]></summary>

GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet. Installing Windows, then, is an all-or-nothing switch that involves wiping SteamOS entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirty years ago, a small team based in Kyoto, Japan, came together to create a new kind of action game. Drawing inspiration from prior projects, that team released Super Mario Bros. in 1985 – a title that would go on to help console gaming step back from the brink of ruin. Since then, Mario’s influence has spread far beyond the games in which he appears. He helped turn Nintendo into an industry leader, and became a cultural icon. Super Mario Bros. started a revolution, and in the process, became one of the most recognizable franchises in the world.

In the first 35 years of the Super Mario series, Mario and his friends appeared in hundreds of titles, but in the core “Super Mario” series, the plumber was present in just under 20 titles. Since Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker 2 are such a unique experiences that are more along the lines of a creation toolset than an actual game, we decided to leave them off of the list.

Distant Worlds 2 is enormous. Even when familiar with the original, even after our preview last month, there's way too much going on to review it comprehensively within a mere few days. But in the spirit of the ancient ones, I can share a review-in-progress of what I've seen so far.
Alright, alright. Partly it's because it's a long game. But it's also because I really want to keep playing.

Shadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

After revealing Lego Luigi last year, who is playable alongside Lego Mario and all of the Super Mario Lego sets revealed thus far, Nintendo has now revealed that everyone’s favorite Mushroom Kingdom princess is becoming a Lego this August. What’s more is that Peach is getting her very own course too: Adventures with Peach Starter Course. 
Fun-packed new #LEGOSuperMario Expansion Sets and characters are coming later this year, including the fabulous new LEGO Peach! #Mar10Day

March 10, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, Lego Peach is looking great! She’ll be an excellent addition in existing sets, but she fits right in to the new Super Mario 64, Super Mario World, and Super Mario 3D World expansion sets joining the Mushroom Kingdom Lego universe. 
Nintendo (kinda) revealed these new expansions today for Mario Day alongside the new Peach figurine, but it didn’t go as far as to name them. However, fans of Mario will surely recognize which game each set is inspired by. The one on the left in the picture below is clearly reminiscent of Super Mario 64, the one in the middle looks a lot like Yoshi’s home/hideout/do dinosaurs own property in the Mushroom Kingdom (?) from Super Mario World, and finally, the set on the right features a cat goomba and climbing tree seen throughout Super Mario 3D World. 
Lego Peach and the Adventures with Peach Starter Course set will be available this August. As for the new expansion sets, a release date has not yet been revealed. 
For more about Lego, check out Lego Luigi and then check out this official boxed Lego Super Mario 64 set after that.

I don’t know about you, but Lego Star Wars was my go-to party game in middle school. The hilarious adventures I had when playing through the classic trilogy and its prequels continue to be some of my favorite co-op memories. The Skywalker Saga is slated to amplify the comedy and expand the universe. A new behind-the-scenes trailer provides exciting details about what the dev team is putting together for Star Wars fans, and it looks marvelous.

Machines don't count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.
There are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.

Joining the likes of Microsoft and Nintendo and dozens of other studios and publishers who have done the same, PlayStation is showing its support for Ukraine by effectively cutting Russia off from its services and titles. SIE called for peace in Ukraine in a statement to The Verge alongside this news. 
“Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” a spokesperson said. “We have suspended all software and hardware shipments, the launch of Gran Turismo 7, and operations of the PlayStation Store in Russia.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like "Tortoise", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is the latest company to halt sales and shipments of its products to Russia amidst its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
Joining the likes of Microsoft and PlayStation and dozens of other game studios, Nintendo has suspended all shipments to Russia for the “foreseeable future.” Still, the company did not say this was in support of Ukraine like most publishers and studios have, as reported by IGN. The publication reached out to Nintendo to ask if it’d be providing a message of support for Ukraine, and a Nintendo spokesperson said, “We would like to express our concern for all those affected by the conflict.” 
“We have decided to suspend shipping all Nintendo products to Russia for the foreseeable future,” Nintendo told IGN. “This is due to considerable volatility surrounding the logistics of shipping and distributing physical goods.” 
This news comes days after Nintendo placed the Russian eShop into maintenance mode, which prevents users from buying digital games, effectively suspending all sales and downloads in the country. As IGN points out, this wasn’t necessarily done in support of Ukraine either, at least not directly and publicly. Nintendo said its payment service no longer processed Russian Rubles, forcing the eShop to close temporarily. 
On top of all of this, Nintendo delayed Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp yesterday due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It did not announce a new release date for the game.

Gran Turismo has been a gold standard for the simulation-racing genre for over 25 years. The franchise has continually served as a showcase for PlayStation’s latest hardware both from visual and technical standpoints. Gran Turismo 7 is no different in this regard; the racing has never felt more precise, nor have the vehicles ever looked truer to life. However, in the time since that initial entry, the field has caught up to Gran Turismo. This new entry is still an excellent driving simulation, but it’s no longer lapping the competition.

Trek to Yomi is a stylish action title that may not have been on your radar before, but its latest trailer during today's State of Play presentation shows off why it may be worth keeping an eye on. 
The game, developed by Shadow Warrior makers Flying Wild Hog, is an action sidescrolling take on classic samurai films. You play as a young swordsman fighting to protect his village and keep a vow to his dying Master. Human enemies aren't the only threat; the trailer shows off spectral warriors, grotesque swamp creatures, and other supernatural elements. The bloody swordplay looks even sharper under the striking monochromatic presentation, a stylistic choice that further evokes the game's cinematic inspirations.

Sony is facing a potential class-action lawsuit alleging sexism, gender discrimination, bias against female employees, and more within U.S. offices. Right now, nine women, some former and some current employees, have shared their experiences of this at Sony PlayStation in court documents. The lawsuit was first filed in 2021 and in February of 2022, Sony asked a court to dismiss it. The hearing for that request will happen in April of 2022.

Sony’s State of Play concluded today with the reveal of Valkyrie Elysium, an upcoming action RPG that serves as a new installment in the beloved Valkryie Profile series. 
The trailer shows off a Valkyrie slaying all manner of monsters using flashy sword attacks and magic-based offense, including summoning copious amounts of lightning. She does so at the behest of the All-Father in order to prevent the world's destruction by way of Ragnarok. 
The reimagined combat folds in gameplay elements from Valkyrie Profile games such as special attacks and combos. Whether or not you control a party of characters assigned to in…]]></summary>

Ever wanted to tackle the challenges of Returnal with a friend? Now you can! Coming with the Ascension update on March 22, players can tackle the entirety of Returnal in co-op mode. Well, almost the entire journey. Another new content offering coming with this update, The Tower of Sisyphus, cannot be played in co-op mode. This new locale is a gauntlet of trials, tribulations, and death. While we don't know exactly what to expect with the Tower, it's fairly safe to assume that it will feature some randomization elements, and possibly some new story beats, enemies, and bosses to add to the already impressive Returnal roster.
Apparently, you can access the tower fairly early on in the game, after obtaining the Icarian Grapnel (this is off the second major boss).  I'm not sure which is more exciting – the prospect of bringing in a friend to take on Returnal with or tackling new Returnal content! Let's just go with it's awesome to see new stuff coming to Returnal this late in the game, and maybe the teamplay will even coax some new players into the haunting world of Atropos. Check out the new trailer right here.

Revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, The DioField Chronicle's trailer begins with a storybook-like retelling of a war that ravaged a region. The Alliance fought against the Empire and in the end, it seems the Empire was left standing. However, the Kingdom of Alletain remain untouched during the war and now, the Empire is taking them on. The trailer seems to indicate that you, the player, are in control of Alletain and its soldiers.

Square Enix has plenty of long-running powerhouse franchises under its belt, from Final Fantasy to Dragon Quest. But every so often, the acclaimed publisher takes a chance on a new idea, and that looks like something we’ll be seeing more of thanks to the establishment of Luminous Productions.
Luminous Productions was formed for the sole purpose of developing new IPs, and for its first project, Forspoken, the studio wasn’t afraid to step outside of its comfort zone and bring in new talent, like Gary Whitta (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and Amy Hennig (Uncharted), to realize its ambition.

With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Valhalla enters its endgame phase with its final DLC Dawn Of Ragnarök, the very concept for which is kind of a big honking spoiler, so consider yourself forewarned.
The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.

Given that it refers to new first-person shooters which evoke games from the '90s, shouldn't they be millenial shooters? Fresh from killing napkins and mayonnaise, here come millenials to kill Shub-Niggurath.

This is clearly me fighting a losing semantic battle, but in any case, Humble's Boomer Shooters Bundle has a lot of great games, including Dusk, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, HROT, and more for £9.05/$12.

It's delightful, and after a year on Epic's game store, the Epic Games Store, it's available on Steam.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There's also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Elden Ring before its official launch was an honest experience. I'd flick the game online and see a few messages scrawled on the ground in glowing chalk. It was a Lands Between where "try jumping" wasn't some evil trickery, and "illusory wall ahead" meant discovering a hidden passage.
Since the game's release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.

It's a game which generates great stories, often delightful, often horrifying. This appears to have got it in trouble. Australia's classification board last week gave RimWorld a rating of RC—Refused Classification. As a result, the game is no longer available to buy on Steam in Australia, though folks who already own it can still play.

In it, you'll be taking to the streets of Barcelona as a professional driver, picking up customers and obeying traffic laws to get them from A to B. That's the taxi bit. The tycoon bit comes a bit later, letting players build up their own business until they've got enough cars and staff to do the driving for them. It's coming to early access on Steam toward the end of 2022, so let's hail down an announcement trailer, shall we?

They weren't being synced properly online with the Steam Cloud, which led to Steam asking whether they wanted to use the cloud save or local save. This question spooked some, leading them to choose poorly and end up with an old save, missing maybe hours of progress. Oh no. That ssshould be fixed now, by a Steam patch Valve released on Friday. But do be cautious if you're asked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Katharine told me about this idea to take a look at RPS Advent Calendar winners of years past, I thought it was a good idea. But when she said she wanted me to do the first one, and that the first GOTY awarded on RPS was 2007's Portal, I almost laughed. Does Portal hold up? Why even bother asking? Shut this whole article down. Of course it holds up. It's Portal.
Of course, conventional bait-and-switch writing would dictate that this is the point where I tell you that, aha, after playing Portal again in the blinding light of 2022 it's actually a heap of rubbish, such as could only otherwise be found on the streets on day ten of a two week bin-lorry strike. But obviously that is not the case, because we're talking about Portal. If anything it's even better than I remember. Like. It's fuckin' Portal.

Blimps is an odd game. At a glance, it looks like an Elite-esque trading game, but it's more like... well. It's more like a game from the time before genres. A confusing, poorly explained time that mostly produced rubbish but occasionally produced a strange little gem like this.


You run a little airship business, on paper. In practice, your job is to figure out how to make enough money to get out. Ideally within an hour.

I'm thinking that Halo 3 "Believe" one that featured a cool diorama, or Gears Of War teaming up with Gary Jules for an emotional rendition of Mad World. We just aren't treated to the same level of grandeur nowadays. A few frames, Guns N' Roses, "RATED M FOR MATURE". That's our lot.
But Thailand clearly puts out good video game adverts. One of note features Elden Ring, a family, a strange trumpet noise, and a story as complex and obtuse as FromSoft's offerings. Give it a watch below, you won't be disappointed. More confused and emotional, perhaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Elden Ring was first thrust out into the world back in 2019, I have to admit I was pretty nonplussed about it. I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.

But thankfully there's a mod that lets you do just this, giving you peace of mind when faced with a bleep from your beloved 800W box. Worth a look, I reckon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.
But the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!

If there's no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you've either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are "cringe". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe. Here are nine minor NPCs who became major players.

Basically we're talking about when you do normal work in games that isn't hero-slaying-monster type stuff, you know?
A really bumper number of digressions this week, though. The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast. Plus, Nate has a Cavern Of Lies this week which is themed about, er, Nate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. 
A long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some things are synonymous with Soulsborne games. Approachability, which Alice Bee thinks is a very relative term. Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.
There's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing "hahaha" of old. And it makes me sad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days before Steam Deck preorders began shipping out, I called up Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais and designer Jake Rodkin for a chat about the handheld PC. At this point I’d already been testing it for a while, and as you can now tell from my Steam Deck review, was already sold on both the promise and (mostly) the execution of this plastic go-anywhere gaming machine. Now, it was time to find out more about how it came to be, what new tricks we can expect in the future, and what work is already going to on ensure compatibility with as many Steam games as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm replaying the first Portal at the moment, so maybe I'm just extra-susceptible to the Valve man coming around selling tickets for his hype-train, but playing Aperture Desk Job was like sitting in a nice warm bath. It's a "playable short" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.
In fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.

As if Elden Ring wasn't enough game to be getting on with, we also had strategy behemoth Total War: Warhammer 3 alongside surprise hit Lost Ark. You could argue that after a month as busy as February, we could all do with a bit of space to actually play these enormous games before we throw anything else onto our already bursting backlogs.
Sadly, I come bearing terrible news. March is yet another jam-packed month for new releases, with huge titles such as GhostWire: Tokyo and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands threatening to tear our attention away from the wonderful Elden Ring. And that’s before I tell you about promising indie releases like Tunic and Weird West!

That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.


Valve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox is a delighful name to say. I keep calling it Fikfok, once by mistake and then the rest of the time on purpose. You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.
Vix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. I'm sorry this month's Letter From The Editor is a bit late. February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  
Of course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.
