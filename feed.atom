It's long been rumoured - and leaked - that Kojima Productions are also developing a horror game, thought to be called Overdose. It was finally officially revealed at The Game Awards this evening. It's actually called OD, and it's being developed in partnership with Jordan Peele.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We'll get to explore Dead by Daylight's world once more through The Casting of Frank Stone, a new title by Behaviour Interactive in partnership with Supermassive Games. 


From the brief glimpse of the game the debut trailer offers, we discover we have a mystery on our hands, and like several titles from Supermassive, your choices will shape the story and outcome. You'll be thrust into Cedar Hills where a group of friends uncover the bloody legacy of Stone. 


The game seems to be perfectly positioned to take advantage of Supermassive's greatest skills. Its narrative-based, choice-centered structure is something the studio has had plenty of experience with. With franchises like The Dark Pictures Anthology under its belt, the studio's also no stranger to the horror genre. 




This time around, the terror centers around the depths of a steel mill in Oregon where the sadistic actions of a serial killer spawn horrors beyond comprehension. If you're looking for something to raise the hairs on your neck, this seems like a title worth checking out. 


The Casting of Frank Stone launches in 2024 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Sure, the first 52 seconds are some live-action skit, but the following 41 seconds announce no less than five games. Sega are returning to their glory days once again, with new games coming based on Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Streets Of Rage, Golden Axe, Shinobi, "and more." You can get a few tiny glimpses at those in the trailer below.

The new horror game combines Until Dawn’s branching storyline approach with Dead by Daylight’s supporting fiction of a malevolent Entity, trapping people in fog-bound pocket dimensions with legendary killers, so as to feast on their fear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During The Game Awards, Sega dropped a lucid hallucination of a trailer briefly highlighting five games allegedly in development. This includes a new Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. The also tease a “and more.”


The games go by in a flash. We see a Jet Set Radio that looks pretty on point with colorful graphics and familiar city environments. Then there’s a full 3D Streets of Rage. Afterward, we see a stylish 2D Shinobi. Next is a 3D Golden Axe without a sexy panther man or centaur in sight. Finally, we get to Crazy Taxi, which seemingly highlights multiplayer.




As excited as I am for some of these announcements, a few of them look kind of off. Specifically Streets of Rage and Crazy Taxi. What makes me worry is that Sega has previously cited a “Fortnite-style” service model, specifically referring to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. Live service model, friends. Hopefully, they’ve changed their ways and we can eventually be legitimately excited to see these games return.


None of the games have a release date, but Sega says they’ll share more soon.

Hungry purple dinosaur? There are people talking to a camera and getting scared. It’s being made with Xbox Game Studios.




Okay, he then explains things. It’s groundbreaking and challenging. Uses cloud gaming technology. Immersive and something no one has seen before. It is a game, but also a movie, and also a new form of media. Jordan Peele is here. Maybe he’ll clear up what OD is. Nope, he’s just talking about how great Hideo Kojima is.


Okay, there you have it, everyone! Lots to look forward to. It’s shaping up great. Wow.


OD is maybe coming out eventually, probably for Xbox and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been some cool things revealed at the 2023 Game Awards. As you might have seen, I've written about some of them. But I'm here to tell you all that a new game in the Mana series has been revealed, and it practically made me jump out of my chair.


Visions of Mana is a brand new entry in the Mana series, which to this point has mostly survived off remakes and a failed gacha game. This new game, from the little we've seen so far, looks like everything I'd want in a new Mana game. There's some flashy Action-RPG combat, a world full of whimsy and magic, and what looks like a variety of spells courtesy of some familiars. It's all huge Secret of Mana vibes and I am here for it.




While the Mana series has struggled in the past, I can't help but have high hopes for this one. Some may remember that Secret of Mana was one of my picks for the best SNES games ever, and I'd love to see this series get a modern twist on that classic charm I loved so much in my younger years. Anything can happen, of course. We only have a small trailer to analyze, after all. But my fingers are very crossed for this one.


Visions of Mana will release in 2024. Stay tuned as we learn more about Visions of Mana.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next Team Ninja game has locked in a fairly competitive release date. Its next action game Rise of the Ronin arrives on March 22, 2024.


The new game certainly looks up Team Ninja's alley, with plenty of fast combat, slicing, and dicing. It's been known for a while, but now, we finally know when the game arrives.


At tonight's The Game Awards 2023, we got a new trailer looking at the title. Set during a time where the country is divided, it follows one ronin who could have a hand in shaping Japan's future.




Coming off the fairly well-received Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Ronin does look like Team Ninja trying to keep the string of excellent action games going. But it's headed into a crowded 2024, with one particular competitor that it now shares a release date with: Dragon's Dogma 2.


Whether you going for one, the other, or both, it does look like we won't be hurting for action RPGs in the new year. Rise of the Ronin arrives for PlayStation 5 on March 22, 2024.

It may sound like a new energy drink but nope, it's more action fighting in the Budokai Tenkaichi series. Players will be able to learn and master a roster of playable DBZ characters with their own signature abilities, transformations, and techniques. In a cool twist, the arenas will also crumble around you as you fight in them.




I'm admittedly way behind on anything Dragon Ball but this looks like exactly what fans of those games would want, with single-player and online multi-player modes.


No release timeframe was given but Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As nice as the usual salvo of remakes and sequels is, it's nice to see acclaimed developers take on new worlds every now and then. To fill this niche, Moon Studios, the creators of the acclaimed Ori series, has revealed a new RPG called No Rest for the Wicked.


We can see some vague cinematics at the start, setting the stage for a somber story. However, once the gameplay kicks in, we get a glimpse of an ARPG-style perspective of our protagonist running through some scenery and fighting enemies. It's hard to get a feel for the combat here, but it sure looks cool. The variety of weapon types shown makes me think that players will have a few different playstyles to choose from here.




While we didn't see a firm release date, we'll learn more about this game on March 1, 2024 as part of the Wicked Inside digital showcase. Stay tuned as we learn more about this new Action RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja revealed Rise of the Ronin, its PlayStation 5-exclusive action game, during a State of Play last year. The game made an appearance at The Game Awards 2023 to showcase more of its fast-paced action alongside the news that it will hit PS5 on March 22, 2024. 
In the trailer, we see a Ronin take the steps to save a late-Edo period japan from chaos, dark magic, and more. While the trailer focuses on the game's combat, with trademark Souls-like Team Ninja action at play, it also highlights some of its traversal. Players will get to explore Japan on foot, on horse, and by way of glider.
Check it out for yourself below in the new Rise of the Ronin trailer: 
"Japan at the end of the 19th century was characterized by the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period of oppression and stagnation," the trailer's description reads. "Explore the vast world of late-Edo period Japan by horse and glider, while battling foes using a wide range of weapons and equipment – melee weapons like swords and spears, as well as ranged weapons like firearms and thrown weapons." 
Rise of the Ronin hits PS5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 made an appearance at The Game Awards with a brand new trailer that confirms the game is coming 2024.


The latest Hellblade 2 trailer comes after an amazing musical appearance from Heilung performing an original song from the upcoming sequel. Ninja Theory was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, so it's no surprise that the studio's upcoming game will only be available on PC and Xbox Series X/S. 


The latest trailer doesn't offer new story information, but it does show us what a visual feast the sequel will be. It also gives us a glimpse of some of the combat which appears to be much more impactful and bloodier than its predecessor.


The game continues the tale of Senua, a warrior who travels through Helhein to recover the soul of her lover. Her journey is far from straightforward, as she must deal with the Furies in her head that can both help and harm her. The game was lauded for its unique gameplay elements and its well-researched depiction of Psychosis. 


If you're interested in jumping into Ninja Theory's latest offering, you'll be able to pick it up day one on Game Pass.

The style looks fantastic, and I love the mix of an urban locale with spirits. Coming off Ghostwire: Tokyo, I guess it makes sense.


I'm very curious to see how this turns out, as showrunner Geoff Keighley mentioned before the trailer that Unseen has not signed for any platforms or publishers yet. It might be a while until Kemuri sees a launch, but I'm keen to see how it shapes up when it arrives.


Meanwhile, if you want to see more of what Nakamura and crew have been up to, check out the "Remnant Tour" mini-doc to learn more.

That's exactly one week before the game action-adventure platformer releases on January 18. We also got a story trailer that shows some of the trials and tribulations protagonist Sargon will encounter in the Sands of Time in full 2.5D platforming goodness. The Lost Crown is the first new major entry in the Prince of Persia series since 2010.




Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is coming to current and last-generation platforms including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The video didn't say which of the platforms the trailer will be released on, so hopefully it's all of them.


UPDATE: Ubisoft has confirmed the demo will be available digitally on Ubisoft+, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation5, PlayStation®4, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One as well as Windows PC through the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store.

I don’t even know what to say about this. Steam page to the rescue. Apparently, Big Walk is “a cooperative multiplayer adventure about teamwork and talking.” Oh! Those two things. Okay, let’s look at the trailer.

I guess that is self-explanatory. Maybe. It just doesn’t seem like much. Let’s go back to the Steam store page: “Adventuring aside, there’s plenty of time to just hang out. Sit and watch the sunset, or steal your friend’s binoculars and kick them into the ocean. Spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk.”


Cool. Okay. Could be fun. Let's hope we learn more about it soon.


Big Walk is coming out in 2025. Right now, it seems that only PC is confirmed.

In Big Walk, you and your friends will explore an open world full of puzzles and things to discover. According to the Steam page, you'll need to figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless. This explains why, in the trailer, we see lots of attempts at communication, from waving arms to holding up certain images.

The trailer, as many video game trailers are, doesn't tell us a lot about the new content. We see Kratos on a boat, he spends a few seconds opening a door, and then some enemies get stabbed and slammed. After the trailer, Game Awards host Geoff Keighley called the pack "an adventure that blends God of War: Ragnarok's combat with elements inspired by the roguelike genre." How roguelike-inspired the new content will be remains to be seen.




Speaking on the decision to make the DLC free, Keighley went on to say "the team at Santa Monica Studio are fans of their fans, and are offering this DLC, God of War: Ragnarok: Valhalla, as a gift to the community." Thanks Santa Monica Studio! I guess we can all see what this DLC offers soon enough.


Stay tuned as we learn more about this surprise announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archetype Entertainment has revealed what they've been working on. Exodus is a new sci-fi action shooter for current-gen consoles and PC.


We didn't get too much solid info on what Exodus is, aside from an emotional trailer that quickly segued into some gameplay of action and shooting. It was introduced at The Game Awards 2023 by actor Matthew McConaughey, who will play a role in Exodus and did make mention of "alright, alright, alright."




Per the trailer description, Exodus is a sci-fi action-adventure role-playing game. According to a press release, which goes into further detail, Exodus will focus on consequences of the player's actions due to time dilation, and how that time disparity can change the lives of those you love. As a Traveler on interstellar journeys, days for you might mean even longer back home.


"Exodus introduces an innovative new sci-fi world that forces players to face the consequences of their choices over time," said studio head James Ohlen. "We introduce the player, as the Traveler, to an original sci-fi universe, a world created with an incredible level of detail in collaboration with award-winning sci-fi authors. The gameplay setting and story we created is built around the impact of Time Dilation, a concept I’ve been fascinated with since I was 12 years-old. We use Time Dilation as a catalyst impacting the choices you make in-game that sets in motion events affecting your relationships with your loved ones, and your entire civilization, for generations."


Archetype Entertainment is a studio made up of BioWare veterans, under the auspices of Wizards of the Coast. Time will tell, as we don't have a release date or anything as of yet. But given just the talent and premise we've seen here, I'm already interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory made another appearance at The Game Awards, this time with a new trailer for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. In the trailer, we get confirmation that it's still expected to hit Xbox Series X/S in 2024 alongside a new look at its extremely visceral combat. 
Like previous Hellblade II trailers, we see Senua trudging through some dangerous wilderness. She's not fighting giant monsters this time, though, as instead, she's up against more human-sized enemies. And this trailer gives us the most in-depth look at Hellblade II's combat yet – unsurprisingly, it looks great (and gruesomely realistic). 
Check it out for yourself in the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay trailer below: 


"The sequel to the award winning Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice sees Senua return in a brutal journey of survival through the myth and torment of Viking Iceland," the trailer's description reads. "Intent on saving those who have fallen victim to the horrors of tyranny, Senua faces a battle of overcoming darkness within and without."
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S sometime next year. 
For more, watch this Hellblade II gameplay footage from earlier this year, and then check out this behind-the-scenes look at the game's facial animation technology.

I thought announcing Pony Island 2 during the pre-show would be hard to top but to follow that up with the announcement of World Of Goo 2? Pack it up. We're done. The sequel to our favourite game of 2008 is due to launch in 2024, bringing not just new puzzles to build things from goo but exciting new fluids too. I can scarcely wait to cover my goo in goop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarök fans got three surprises at The Game Awards. One, the game is getting an expansion. Two, it drops next week. And three, it's free. 
The expansion, called Valhalla, will be totally free. We see Kratos and Mimir traveling to an unknown where he battles the usual Norse creatures but also threats from his past, such as cyclops and undead Greek soldiers. PlayStation's official synopsis, posted below, describes the adventure as featuring some kind of roguelite element, but it is currently unclear what that means exactly. 


God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla arrives on December 12 for both the PS5 and PS4 versions of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Exodus is an upcoming sci-fi game about time dilation. Most notably, it features actor Matthew McConaughey, famous for his roles in True Detective and Dazed & Confused. And while he announced the game on-stage at the show, interestingly, the trailer didn't even feature McConaughey.
Judging by quick looks in the reveal, Exodus is a third-person action adventure. Its main narrative conceit revolves around an alien discovery and a couple experiencing time at different intervals. As the trailer's narrator says, "It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her."
Check out the reveal trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finji, a studio known for its work on Indie hits like Tunic and Chicory, announced its latest project at The Game Awards today. It's called Usual June, and it tells the story of a girl struggling to balance her summer break with saving the universe. You can watch the reveal trailer below.


Even after watching the trailer, you might not have much of an idea of what the game is about; it's pretty scarce when it comes to concrete information. We see the protagonist (fittingly named June) as she hacks and slashes her way through spectral creatures in a mysterious world. Luckily, the Steam listing for the game provides some context to her actions. Here's a bit of what the developer has to say about the game:
 It sounds like it'll be telling a typical coming-of-age story mashed up with supernatural heroics. In between story beats, players will also be able to experience some "frantic, flexible combat." We'll be able to get a taste of that ourselves when the game drops some time in 2025.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, the team behind the Persona series, Atlus, revealed its next RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio. Like the Persona franchise, Metaphor: ReFantazio features all the style and substance you'd expect, with excellent UI and font styling. A new trailer released during The Game Awards 2023 reveals it's coming in the fall of next year. 
Studio Zero is handling the development of the title, with Atlus publishing it, and it's clear the team is taking inspiration from Atlus' Persona series, especially its latest, Persona 5. However, despite the visual similarities, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand new game set in its own fantasy universe. 
Check out the latest Metaphor: ReFantazio trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there's plenty to be excited about in this new Atlus IP. Between the fast-paced and stylish turn-based combat, excellent voice acting, and great music from composer Shoji Meguro (whose credits include Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5), Metaphor: ReFantazio is easily one of the most anticipated titles for 2024.
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

Today he announced Pony Island 2: Panda Circus, a new genre-shifting curio described as "a phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video games." I like that this description is likely wholly earnest and accurate. This news came during the pre-show for Geoff Keighley's Shopping Hour and if a game like this is relegated to the pre-show, I can only assume the main event will include Half-Life 3, Elden Ring 2, and Deus Ex 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the game awards, Daniel Mullins Games, the creator of Pony Island and Inscryption announced their next game, Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.


The trailer shows an individual taking a fancy-looking USB drive to a fancy-looking arcade cabinet. Then things get really lo-fi, and then things start glitching out in a sinister manner. The video description describes it as, “a phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video games. Escape the lordly deities of the underworld with your soul, and your sanity, intact.”




When I saw that the game was coming from the maker of Inscryption, I was pretty underwhelmed when it started glitching out. But since it’s an actual sequel to 2016’s Pony Island, I think it would be pretty strange if it didn’t have the fourth wall breaking meta-narrative.


I’ve played both Pony Island and Inscryption. Pony Island is a solid time that puts you in a toxic relationship with Satan. Inscryption on the other hand, was absolutely terrific in the first chapter and then kind of underwhelmed. I’m probably still on board for another one.


The release date for Pony Island 2: Panda Circus flickers between 2024, 2025, and 2026. Your guess is as good as mine, but it will probably be on PC first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motion Twin, the team behind Dead Cells, has revealed its next game and it's an isometric action game called Windblown. Revealed during The Game Awards 2023, Windblown's most striking feature, other than being the next game from the team behind Dead Cells, is its animated art style. 
The game itself drops the 2.5 nature of Dead Cells for a more top-down, isometric approach with 3D action, and it looks great. It's due out on PC early access sometime in 2024. Other platforms were not mentioned. 
Check out the Windblown reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Windblown, players control a Leaper on a mission to defend the Ark from a "very aggro Vortex." You can absorb memories of fallen warriors, according to Motion Twin, and then put them to good use by infusing their skills into your weapons. Plus, you can take part in all of Windblown's action with up to two friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[505 Games have revealed a remake of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, the mournful 2013 fantasy adventure from Josef Fares and Starbreeze Studios. It's due for release on 28th February 2024, and here's the first trailer.
A Tale of Two Sons is notable for having a split control scheme - you steer each brother with a different analog stick, weaving their movements together to bypass obstacles and puzzles. It's also notable for being a sad 'un: your goal in the game is to find a remedy for your sick father, which involves a journey up a mountain to a magical tree.
"It may well look like a kids-friendly game, but be warned that things do get surprisingly dark in places, and you'd end up having some pretty difficult conversations with any little ones once it's over," John Walker (RPS in peace) wrote back in 2013. "These are adult themes, presented in a mature way, via the lives of two fantastic children. And it's well worth your time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're only a couple minutes into The Game Awards, and the World Premieres are already coming. Kicking off the show, a remake of 2013's Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was announced.


The trailer is certainly in the "teaser" territory more than anything. We see some prettier versions of locations from the original game, as well as some gameplay featuring the titular brothers. Honestly, it's been so long since I've even seen the original game that I can't really compare much from memory. The single player co-op game certainly made waves a decade ago, so we'll have to see if the remake has the same impact.




Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons: Remake (is that really the title?) will launch on February 28, 2024. Stay tuned as we learn more about this reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, the award-winning 2013 indie from developer Starbreeze Studios, is getting remade. Italy-based developer Avantgarden, the team behind 2017's Last Day Of June and formerly named Ovosonico, is handling the remake and building it in Unreal Engine 5. Original publisher 505 Games is publishing the remake, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28, as well. 
505 Games says original Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons director, Josef Fares, who later founded Hazelight Studios, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 for It Takes Two, has endorsed the remake. 
Check out the Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


"Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake faithfully re-tells the remarkable heart-rending journey of brothers Naia and Naiee as they embark on a quest to save the life of their dying father," a press release reads. "Built on the Unreal Engine 5, every step of the brothers' journey has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up for the most immersive story possible, whilst remaining faithful to the original game. 
"As an additional bonus, the classic single-player experience is now also joined by local co-op, allowing friends to each control a brother's actions." 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons won a BAFTA for Game Innovation, the Downloadable Game of the Year from the D.I.C.E and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and Best Xbox Game as the VGAs after its release. 
Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons Remake hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, the Epic Game Store, and GOG, on February 28, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequel to a sequel would be "a little bit wild".
If you're wondering what the chances are of a "direct sequel" to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, don't get your hopes up. During an interview with Game Informer, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was asked about the possibility and says Tears of the Kingdom has already exhausted all of the possibilities in this particular world.

"Well that would be a sequel to a sequel, which is getting a little bit wild when you think about it! But as I've mentioned previously, with Tears of the Kingdom, we were seeking to build on top of the world we created with Breath of the Wild and really exhaust the possibilities of what we could put into that world. I think it is – to use a bit of a term – an apotheosis, or the final form of that version of The Legend of Zelda. In that regard, I don't think that we'll be making a direct sequel to a world such as that that we've created."

The show kicks off at 7:30 p.m. ET / 4:30 p.m. PT, on channels like YouTube and Twitch. You can watch it in the embed below, or through one of the countless number of channels that will co-stream it elsewhere.




A big but difficult year for games


This is usually the part of the watch post where I speculate on what we'll see there. We've already seen confirmations that games like Atlus' Metaphor: ReFantazio will be in attendance, as will Timothée Chalamet and Gonzo. Because at this point, the Awards must have to contractually include a Muppet.

Destructoid’s own Steven “Axel Grease” Mills is currently on the case, but he reports that he can’t even get onto a server. However, Steam user Dr. Compton states, “Turns out it is a real game. Kind of wish it wasn’t.” Others report that The Day Before’s performance isn’t quite what it should be. Some state that the settings menus don’t quite work right. A few imply that it’s not really a survival game, but is actually an extraction shooter.

At the time of its launch, producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi didn't know what the community reaction would eventually become.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an enjoyer of PC games, the only thing that could possibly be better than a Steam Deck OLED is a free Steam Deck OLED. Or maybe money to buy all my wishlisted games. The Game Awards 2023 is offering up a chance to get Valve's new handheld via a giveaway that starts tonight.


The Game Awards 2023 kicks off today, December 7, at 7:30 pm EST. Once it starts, you can navigate over to the Steam Deck OLED giveaway page for a chance to get one for free. The Game Awards is also shelling out for the 1 TB version, not the 512 GB OLED, meaning you could potentially save yourself $649 to buy one yourself. The giveaway begins as the show starts, and will end at 11 pm EST tonight. Those chosen will get an email on Friday, December 8.





How to qualify for a free Steam Deck OLED during The Game Awards


The Game Awards is using a Gleam widget on the giveaway page with a countdown leading to the start of the show. To enter, you'll need to provide contact information such as your email address, name, and address. You're also required to have a Steam account. During the show, you'll have to follow the Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards accounts on X/Twitter. 


It looks like following all the steps will award four entries, which you can use during the giveaway. There are more rules, of course, and not every country qualifies. So be sure to check out the page ahead of time.


If you don't want a free Steam Deck OLED, The Game Awards has other giveaways. There are 100 Lenovo Legion Go handhelds on offer tonight. The AMD-powered rival handheld has an MSRP of $699.99 for the 512 GB model. Getting it potentially for free certainly sounds much more desirable. You may also win tickets for Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood.

The trailer came out earlier than expected due to an unfortunate leak. Regardless, the graphics and world made the 10-year wait for a new Grand Theft Auto worth it for fans. With that, we are returning to a familiar location: Vice City. However, it's just a small part of the bigger map of Leonida. 


Yes, you can probably tell it's a clear reference to the real-life Florida. The references to the state don't end at the name, as many crazy scenes in the trailer actually happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've collected video game delay notices like Christmas candy, and today I have one more to shove in the stocking. The Alone in the Dark remake has been delayed once more until early next year — but the reason should leave most feeling jolly.


The Alone in the Dark remake is moving from its (already delayed) January 2024 launch to later on March 20, 2024. Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Pieces Interactive sent out a notice for the delay. It wrote that the companies are pushing the game a bit longer in order to "avoid any potential crunch over the Christmas holidays."

Alone in the Dark delayed until March to prevent any holiday humbug


Frankly, I'm totally okay with this reasoning. Normally, I'm also perfectly fine with companies delaying for polish reasons. But allowing game developers to relax and sip hot cocoa during the holidays without the ghost of Christmas crunch looming overhead is a big win in my book. Of course, additional game polish is a goal with the delay. 


"THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive want to ensure that the game not only meets but exceeds the expectations of the community," THQ Nordic explained, "especially with the outstanding performances of Hollywood stars David and Jodie as the main protagonists."


The Alone in the Dark remake returns to the series' roots, mashing together psychological horror with "Southern Gothic" charm. It starts David Harbour and Jodie Comer as co-protagonists Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively. The story was penned by Mikael Hedberg of SOMA and Amnesia fame. A Guillermo del Toro collaborator, Guy Davis, is contributing monster designs.

So far, Alone in the Dark is looking promising. But then again, anything would appear significantly better than what the series has been dishing out for the last 15 years or so.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is celebrating its 5th anniversary today, 7th December 2023, and we're publishing a handful of pieces to celebrate. Here, we'll be discussing the future of the Smash series — what's next? Is there even a next? And where do we think Sakurai will be involved?

It's hard to believe that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is five years old. It's one of the defining games of the Nintendo Switch, and along with its incredible roster of characters, stages, music — basically everything — it's easily one of the best fighting games ever. At least, in our humble opinion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your wallets ready because the soon-to-be "Dearly Beloved" Sora amiibo is on its way. The latest Super Smash Bros. amiibo arrives on February 16. 


Pre-orders have started to pop up at retailers, though it already seems like folks are clamoring to get their own Sora. It will likely be available at usual retailers, though. Sora marks the last Super Smash Bros. character to get an amiibo.




Better summon your bank account for this Sora amiibo


The Sora amiibo clocks in at the standard $15.99 that other Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo have cost. If you aren't able to pre-order Sora, you'll likely have to face the wrath of the second-hand market. 


Just like the rest of the Smash Bros series, Sora takes on the same pose as his appearance in the character select screen in Ultimate. He's giving a big smile as he holds the keyblade over his shoulder. His attire is based on Sora's original costume from the first game. It's one of his best looks, but that might be my nostalgia talking.


The amiibo can be used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and will learn from your attacks as it levels up. You can use it in amiibo battles online and in regular Smash matches. It would be cool if it had some integration with Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory, but right now, there's no other usage announced.

Something else you should know about Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory


You may have forgotten this, but if you have a Melody of Memory save file on your Switch, you'll unlock a new song in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It's the "Dearly Beloved" theme from the rhythm game's main menu. It's an upbeat, jazzy take on the track that works well in battles within Ultimate.


This story has been updated to reflect pre-orders and pricing going live at some retailers.

There’s a lot to unpack in this four minute long trailer. It opens by returning to Area Zero, the namesake of the DLC bundle and the highlight of the core games. But rather than get into any plot details of what this abyss of Paradox Pokemon contains, we instead get a montage showing both returning gym leaders and new faces alike.

        <updated>2023-12-07T18:34:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an RPG you probably haven’t played before? Maybe check out Tengai Makyou: Zirai, a 1989 PC-Engine CD-ROM² game that just got a fan translation.


The TurboGrafx 16 was an impressive flop in North America. A console failing is interesting enough, but the fact that it was the localized production of a very popular Japanese console makes it even better. The PC-Engine was huge in Japan. It took a sizeable chunk of Nintendo’s market dominance and outdid the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America) overall. We only saw a small fraction of what the Japanese market got, especially when it comes to the CD attachments.


Tengai Makyou: Zirai is the first in the series, sometimes called Far East of Eden over here because that’s the name it was given on the occasions it came so close to being released Westward. Also, it’s subtitled on the disc and title screen. The series is a trilogy of RPGs that were remade a few times, as well as spin-offs covering other genres.

While I’m not intimately familiar with the series, according to the developers behind the translation, the series is “an elaborate joke based around foreigners' misperceptions of Japan.” Tengai Makyou: Zirai is a somewhat humorous warping of Japanese folklore. It doesn’t seem to be on the same level as Ganbare Goemon, but it’s not entirely straight-faced, either.


Being on a CD platform, there’s voice acting, cutscenes, and more elaborate animations. More importantly, it kicked off a popular RPG series that we didn’t really see much of over here in the West. 


The translation of Tengai Makyou: Zirai is the work of user Supper and TheMajinZenki and can be found over here. If you want more, 1995’s Tengai Makyou Zero on the Super Famicom received a fan translation back in 2017.

It's been a long time since we've heard anything about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance port on Nintendo Switch. But today, in a surprise announcement, publisher Plaion has shared an update with us: the port of the 2018 title will be coming to the Switch in early 2024. At last!
The Switch port is being worked on by Saber Interactive, the same team that helped bring The Witcher III: Wild Hunt to the hybrid console, which inspires some faith. But when the game originally launched on PS4, Xbox One, and PC back in 2018, there were some criticisms about performance and bugs — whether those have been fixed and will be absent from the Switch version remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been over two years since it was announced that the 2018 medieval RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance would be launching on Switch. That silence has finally been broken with the news that the Nintendo port is arriving sometime next year.
The Switch version comes in the form of Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Royal Edition. The port is being handled by Saber Interactive (Warhorse Studios is the original developer) and bundles the base game with all released DLC. It will be available both digitally and physically. There's no new trailer showcasing how the game runs on Switch, but Saber did release a few screenshots of the port. 

Kingdom Come: Deliverance first arrived in February 2018 and stars Henry, the son of a blacksmith who embarks on a quest to fight against invaders to avenge the death of his parents and the destruction of his village. The game is best known for its demanding, realistic gameplay, which has earned it a cult following of dedicated fans while polarizing others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam hardware survey has shown that previous Nvidia graphics cards are still very much in vogue when it comes to PC gaming. However, one of the lower-end 3000 series may be getting pushed aside to make room for a GPU that could be, inexplicably, worse.


According to a report from Videocardz – which references the Chinese website Board Channels – Nvidia may be replacing its RTX 3050 card in favor of a similar one, but with less memory. It's been suggested that Team Green could opt to manufacture and sell a 3050 with 6GB of RAM instead of the 8GB it currently has.

Quite why this would be the case is not clear, but the report suggests it may be down to this older GPU "impacting sales of the RTX 4060 too much." If the 3050 does get replaced with a lower spec version, it could be on the market by January, according to a Board Channels quote translated by Videocardz.


The usual tempering of expectations is recommended


As always with these things, it's best to take the information at face value for now. Until Nvidia confirms or denies these speculations, we have to assume that's what they are: just speculations.


It's believed that the RTX 3050 6GB card will still use the GA106 chip, but have a TDP of 75W. The current model has a TDP of 130W, so it's possible the rest of the hardware configurations will have a bit of a downgrade as well.


As I say, these details have yet to be confirmed so take them with a pinch of salt. Whatever reason Nvidia has for discontinuing an Ampere GPU and replacing it with a weaker model, it's best to hold off judgement until someone from the company addresses it. At the time of writing, Team Green has yet to comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive Monster is very slowly lifting the curtain of their upcoming Cult of the Lamb DLC, Sins of the Flesh. They will be showing off a teaser of the expansion every week until December 25. So we got one today (the 7th), which means we’re going to get (checks calendar) two more.


The gif animation we got today depicts the nudist ritual. Here you go, look at it.


Image via Massive Monster


That’s all we’ve got. That is the new “all we know” about Sins of the Flesh.


Actually, no, not quite. On November 28, 2023, the Cult of the Lamb Twitter announced that if they passed the 300K follower mark, they would add sex into the game. They almost immediately gained an additional 100K followers, putting them well over the mark.


That means sex, right? Speaking to Polygon, the developers said, “We used games like Pokémon and The Sims when it comes to references, but put our own cult-ish spin on things. The age rating will not change.” So, that means, suggested sex, right? Like WooHoo from The Sims?


Yes! Maybe! Probably somewhat. Or possibly not at all…


Posting on Steam Discussions (you owe me for delving into that cesspool), one of the developers states, “Hello! Here to soothe some worries. 'Sex Update' has become a bit of a meme in the community, one that a lot are really running with! But we have made sure all the new content (which is much more than what the keyart suggests) adheres to guidelines so the age rating should not change.”


So, what’s indicated here is that there will be some reference to sex, but you’ll probably still be able to play the incredibly family-friendly Cult of the Lamb in front of your mom. Unless the developers are just straight-up trolling us. It could be both! It’s probably both!


Cult of the Lamb is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Sins of the Flesh update is scheduled for early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in 2022 – read Game Informer's review here – developer Game Freak revealed that the ninth generation of Pokémon would be getting two DLC expansions, just like Pokémon Sword and Shield did. The first installment was called The Teal Mask and it hit Switch on September 13. The second expansion, The Indigo Disk, hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet next week, on December 14, and to celebrate its arrival, Game Freak and Nintendo released a four-minute trailer today showcasing some of the DLC's highlights. 
In it, we see plenty of starter Pokémon – every starter is returning in The Indigo Disk – and various legendaries, too, like the Johto dogs, the Hoenn legendaries, and much more. We also get a taste of Blueberry Academy, its special Blueberry Quests, unique Pokémon-centric minigames, and a dose of tough double battles against various trainers at the school. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the trailer, we also learn of some special upcoming events players can participate in. Until December 21, players can challenge Dialga and Palkia in Tera Raid Battles, and they can collect Darkrai via Mystery Gift, too. Players also have until January 3 to obtain a Master Ball and shiny Lucario via Mystery Gift, and they can take part in three Mass Outbreak events until December 21. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of Christmas, you probably don't think of Morrowind. And why would you? With its fantasy folklore and cursed Ashlands, it's not a fictional universe ripe for December joy. But that doesn't mean you can't be an outlander and not get into the spirit of the season.


To get all of us in the mood for the holidays, Nexus Mods user Danae123 has created an in-game advent calendar for Morrowind. Consisting of one gift per day, it gives you the chance to have a little festive joy up to December 24.

Yes, I'm aware that we're now seven days into the month. That's on me for not spotting this sooner. But you can still claim a gift-a-day from a secret cabin for the rest of the time period.


Candy canes and moon sugar


For obvious reasons, Danae123 doesn't say what the advent gifts are each day. You wouldn't want to spoil the surprise now, would you?


As for how you can collect your presents, when asked on the mod page, a user was told that it's a "vanilla cabin on Solstheim that you are sent to during the Moon Sugar Mystery quest." Given this, you'll need to make sure you have the Bloodmoon expansion installed at the very least, as this is the only way to get access to the Morrowind island.


While many are still playing Skyrim, it's nice to see that the classic Elder Scrolls games are still getting some love. They might not officially celebrate Christmas on the Dunmer island of Vvardenfell, but that shouldn't stop you from wearing a Christmas smile as you slash through Nix Hounds and bandits.

        <updated>2023-12-07T14:02:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days in and the GTA 6 trailer is nearly at 120 million views on YouTube. It's become one of the most-watched video game trailers in history, but it's not just benefitting Rockstar. It's also seeing a revival of a music legend.


According to data sent to the BBC by Spotify, the recent GTA 6 reveal has seen interest in the late rock musician Tom Petty soar, thanks to his song "Love Is A Long Road" being featured in the teaser. Streams for the track – first released in 1989 – have increased by 36,979%.




Yes, I had to do a double take as well, because that's a comma, not a period. Nearly a 37,000% uptick in one song's popularity is insane, but given the hype around the upcoming Grand Theft Auto entry, it's perhaps not too surprising.


Rock never dies


After ten years of waiting, Rockstar finally gave us a taste of things to come in GTA 6. Sadly, we still have a bit longer to wait until it releases, as it's only due to come out in 2025. We don't even have an exact date. All we know is it'll be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. No word on when PC will get it, though.


With Tom Petty's song being given a new lease on life, it calls into question what other tracks will be in the game itself. As a series, Grand Theft Auto is known for its soundtrack, featuring a slew of classics from many artists and bands. 


On a personal note: it absolutely blew my mind when I first heard Slayer's "Raining Blood" on Vice City's V-Rock station. Ah, good times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta scout 'em all.
While Pokémon has long been the undisputed king of the monster-catching RPG niche, there have always been other releases that have offered up their own distinct take on that unique brand of recruitment gameplay. Megami Tensei, for example, pioneered the concept with ‘Demon Negotiation’ in 1987 and Dragon Quest took a crack at it with monster recruitment in Dragon Quest V in 1992, before expanding it into a sub-series with Dragon Quest Monsters in 1998.
Though it always had its fans, Dragon Quest Monsters never quite found its feet in the West, and its popularity started to peter out even across its small handful of Japan-only releases in the last decade. After several years of letting the franchise cool, Square has now decided to bring the series back with Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. While it may not quite be the roaring revival that longtime fans hoped it would be, this new release is nonetheless a fun and engaging new entry that we’d suggest you consider picking up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September, Nintendo revealed that the Kingdom Hearts "Sora" Amiibo for the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate line was coming sometime next year. Now, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 16, 2024. 
Nintendo revealed the release date late last night, on December 6, with a short video on Twitter showcasing the Amiibo. As expected, it adopts the look of Sora in the first Kingdom Hearts – a fan-favorite – with his trademark smile and keyblade hoisted over the shoulder. 
Check out the Sora Amiibo teaser for yourself below: 
The #SmashBros #amiibo of Sora will be released on 2/16/2024! #KingdomHearts pic.twitter.com/y3zdbaLplz
December 7, 2023
Sora is the last fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to get an Amiibo, meaning in February, players can finally complete their Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Amiibo lineup. Right before Sora, though, Nintendo will release the Noah and Mio Amiibo from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on January 19, 2024. Just last month, Nintendo released the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. 
For more, read Game Informer's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then check out the reveal trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4. Read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts 4 after that.

This is indeed an extremely Ubisoft game, with all the busywork and go-here-shoot-that roteness that entails, and although it throws some genuinely gorgeous visuals into the bargain, these also come at the cost of steep hardware requirements.
That said, good performance ain’t out of the question, at least not for modern CPUs and graphics cards. It will just take some digging through the graphics menus – digging that I’ve now completed, so join me as my blackened fingers bash out a convenient guide to Frontiers of Pandora’s PC performance and best settings.

A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

As discovered by Gaming Reinvented, the glitch is admittedly a bit of a faff to pull off, so we're not going to list out every step required here, but be sure to watch the video carefully if you'd like to try it out yourself. Needless to say, you'll need to get started with the 'Hold Storage' glitch, so if you're already familiar with this, then you're on the right track.

The Gold Master Series officially started with The Making of Karateka, but the format was first piloted for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. Rather than just being collections, the titles are interactive documentaries built around the games they contain. In this way, greater context and, therefore, a greater appreciation can be formed for the subjects.




Jeff Minter is a veteran of game design. He began his career in the early 1980’s, developing games for 8-bit microcomputers like the Sinclair ZX81 and the Commodore Vic-20. A lot of his early games were clones of popular arcade titles, which w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what is an odd and pretty funny surprise, Vampire Survivors is getting an Among Us-themed DLC. Titled Emergency Meeting, the DLC sees the survivors teaming up with the Among Us crewmates and fighting alien hordes.


While Among Us is no stranger to crossovers, especially with other indie titles, Emergency Meeting marks Vampire Survivors' first crossover DLC. It's expansive too, adding eight playable characters, 15 weapons, and a new stage called Polus Replica.


As with the base game and other paid DLCs, Emergency Meeting is pretty affordable at $2.50. Fans won't have to wait long to play it either as it comes out on December 18 for PC and Xbox Series consoles. 




Alongside the blog post announcing the DLC, a trailer went live on poncle's YouTube page. It's pretty amazing, as several Vampire Survivors characters are transported to space and meet the Among Us cast. What ensures is a team-up to fend off thousands of angry aliens with planet-destroying powers.


It only slightly exaggerates the gameplay loop in Vampire Survivors, but it exemplifies the power trip that begins when equipped with all possible upgrades in a run. Honestly, I would have been happy with the crossover being just the trailer. An entire DLC paired with it is just the icing on the cake.


As unexpected as this crossover is, it looks like an absolute blast. This alongside patch 1.8 adding the narrative-based Adventures mode means Vampire Survivors fans are getting a significant amount of new content to chew through.

        <updated>2023-12-06T19:46:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open Roads, the narrative adventure game starring Keri Russell (The Americans, Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), finally has a release date, nearly three years after its initial reveal at The Game Awards 2020. It hits consoles and PC on February 22, 2024. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive announced this release date today with a new trailer that features Russell talking about the game. Check out the Open Roads release date trailer for yourself below: 


A likely reason Open Roads took three years to reveal a release date after its 2020 debut is because its original creative lead, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright and director of Gone Home, was accused of cultivating a hostile work environment in 2021, as reported by Polygon. Shortly after the allegations arose, Gaynor stepped back from his role as creative lead and manager. Since then, Open Roads has detached itself from Fullbright, with the small team of developers behind the title going by Open Roads Team.  
Game Informer spoke to the Open Roads Team in 2022 about these changes and how it was moving forward with the game's development – you can read our in-depth feature about it here. 
"In Open Roads, Tess [Devers] and Opal [Russell] embark on a road trip adventure to explore a series of long-abandoned properties, unearthing the past," the game's description reads on Steam. "They'll search the ruins of these places that hold buried memories, things Opal has tried for years to forget. And in this search, they'll discover not just the truth they've been seeking, but each other." 
Open Roads hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Febraury 22, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pour one out for Mimimi Games today, readers. Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. 
Mimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio. Naturally, spoilers circle these waters like hungry sharks, but if you're resigned to such a fate, let's dive in below.

As I mentioned in our RPS reacts piece, I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of a renewed Vice City and you bet I'll be there for the inevitable five-minute narrated trailer that begins with a person saying, "Welcome to Vice City".
There's no doubt Vice City is going to be dense and chaotic, going by all the twerking and the social media parodies of real life Florida folks. But really, I do hope that Rockstar doesn't just reserve next-gen's horsepower for wildness. I want some peace, some quiet, some innocuous suburbs to laze around in. That would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultros is one of those games you can't help but pay attention to. Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/06/lego-fortnite-features-crafting-survival-combat-and-more-in-new-cinematic-trailer"/>
        <updated>2023-12-06T15:20:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the launch of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1, Epic Games revealed Lego Fortnite, a new experience that takes the familiarity of Fortnite and mashes it together with Lego for a new survival adventure experience. Today, Epic Games and Lego released a cinematic trailer for Lego Fortnite that reveals crafting, combat, multiplayer team-ups, a massive world to explore, and more. 
The trailer begins with a standard Fortnite character – Brite Bomber – running into a reality-shifting rift that transports her to a Lego-fied world. There are Lego sheep, castle-like structures, rolling hills and plains, and, unfortunately for this character, a storm. She runs into the castle to discover a crafting bench of sorts where she crafts an axe, and that's where her survival adventure begins.
Check out the Lego Fortnite cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, after crafting an axe, she creates a cabin for shelter, a pen for the Lego sheep, an entire garden, and a bonfire to cook some food. It's not long before banana character Peely (also Lego-fied) shows up, and after hearing the howls of some nearby wolves, the two craft some weapons. From here, the duo meets two others, and together, all four of them set off on a survival adventure that brings them over snowy mountains, into a desert, and eventually, into a cavernous mine where they run into deadly skeletons and a massive monster. 
The trailer's cinematics end there, cutting to a Lego Fortnite title screen that reveals the new experience goes live in Fortnite tomorrow, December 7. 
Lego Fortnite is just one of three new Fortnite experiences revealed alongside Chapter 5 of the Battle Royale mode. Also joining the Fortnite multiverse of experiences is Rocket Racing, a new racing mode, and Fortnite Festival, a new music-centric experience.

The developers have now shared a bit about how it differs from Hi-Rez's Tribes Ascend, released way back in 2012, which we adored.
Created by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 launched back in September and became one of our favorite games of the year – read why in Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review here. Since its release, developer NetherRealm Studios has released additional characters, like Invincible's Omni-Man, while teasing other new fighters like Quan Chi and DC's Peacemaker. Now, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has teased even more new content on the way. 
During the recent CCXP23 event in Brazil, Boon revealed that story DLC is coming, as reported by IGN. 


"Just like we did with [Mortal Kombat 11], we're going to release a second part with more story and we have a big surprise after that," Boon told the crowd at CCXP23. 
Mentioning Mortal Kombat 11, it's likely that Boon was referring to its Aftermath DLC, which included an all-new story and more. After this story DLC release for Mortal Kombat 1, it sounds like players can expect even more in the form of a "big surprise." Unfortunately, Boon stopped short of sharing more about this surprise. 
This additional content speaks to the studio's philosophy around supporting Mortal Kombat 1 post-launch. Boon said during CCXP23 that, "[We're] going to be supporting the game for even longer than we did with Mortal Kombat 11," adding that, "It's going to be fun." 


If the recent cadence of content is any indication, Mortal Kombat 1 fans are in for a treat over the next few years with NetherRealm's latest fighter. 
For more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Boon on the YouTube interview show, Hot Ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.

YouTuber Mr. Beast previously held that record before the GTA VI trailer. At the time of this writing, the trailer has 104 million views on YouTube.

Rockstar celebrated the achievement yesterday with a quote-tweet of Mr. Beast's tweet revealing the "most views on YouTube in 24 hours" record now belongs to GTA VI. Check it out below:

Elsewhere, Rockstar has spent the days since the GTA VI reveal celebrating the milestone by quote tweeting the likes of Lebron James, Tom Petty (whose song, "Love Is A Long Road" plays in the trailer), and more. It even posted the trailer natively to Twittter.
Grand Theft Auto VI is set to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!

The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, "the humans are bad", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.

The Avatar films are great fun but have never blown me away with original storytelling. Instead, the translation of familiar formulas into a vibrant and visually arresting alien world elevates the films. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora follows that same tack, featuring first-person exploration and combat that borrows liberally from franchises like Far Cry.

Operation Galuga serves as a reimagining of the first Contra game with a roster of heroes bringing the fight to the Red Falcon terrorist faction, which Konami breaks down below:

Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Last of Us Part II is getting the big remaster treatment in January, over three years after it was released for PlayStation 4. This updated version leverages the PlayStation 5’s hardware with graphical bells and whistles like native 4K resolution, improved textures, and unlocked framerate. It also adds new interactive goodies, such as developer commentary and previously unplayable lost levels. But the centerpiece of the package’s new offerings is a new mode called No Return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom scrolling social media looks to have replaced the age-old pasttime of watching TV in GTA 6, which has prompted feelings of alternating despair and increasing irrelevance in me this morning. I barely understand how TikTok works in real-life, let alone a video game pastiche of it, and oh god, how did I get so old and craggy? I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. 
Upon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's "PlanetLeonidaMan" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spare a thought for any game attempting to compete with GTA 6 today. It can't be easy when big hitters like that inevitably suck all the air out the room, but bless the folks at Hollow Ponds for poking their heads above the 4K flamingo parapet anyway by releasing a lovely new demo for their upcoming critter collect 'em up Flock today. I've just been giving it a go over lunch, and it is truly a very relaxing way to decompress after a morning of poring over GTA gubbins.

Born of Bread isn't actually a baking sim. Even better than that: it's some kind of spin on vintage Ninty RPG Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, except that instead of being made of paper, the main character Loaf is made of living dough... but kind of looks like he's made of paper, this being a 2.5D game with flat character art. Look, just watch the trailer while I make myself a sandwich.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I had a feeling we'd see a lot of games about nature and plants and the wild coming out over the next few years, as developers and players alike emerged from being shut inside for basically a year like dairy cows during their annual spring turnout. We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.
Nine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal's partnership has been a fruitful one. Universal Studios Japan's version of Super Nintendo World kicked it all off in late 2020 and early 2021 with a magical experience for Nintendo fans (learn more about our experience here), then in February 2023, Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World opened its doors (see our photo tour of that version here). The collaboration to this point culminated shortly after that with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which garnered strong fan reactions and grossed more than $1 billion at the box office.
While 2025 is the next major milestone for the collaboration, with Super Nintendo World locations opening in Singapore and Orlando, we got an announcement during a Universal Kick-Off media meeting. The big news pertaining to Super Nintendo World, as reported by Universal Parks News Today, is that the previously announced Donkey Kong Country expansion to Universal Studios Japan's park opens this coming spring. The expansion features a new rollercoaster starring the iconic ape, themed merchandise, more interactive experiences, and presumably themed decorations to make you feel like you've traveled to The Country.
While there are currently no plans for the Donkey Kong Country expansion to come to Universal Studios Hollywood, but according to Orlando Park Stop, Epic Universe in Orlando will be getting a mine-cart-themed Donkey Kong rollercoaster. Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios' Epic Universe is currently slated to open in 2025, but prior to that, it sounds as though the Osaka location will debut the DK attractions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rockstar Games announced last week that it was going to release the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI on Tuesday, December 5. However, the studio released the trailer a day earlier – watch the official GTA VI reveal trailer here – after it leaked online. The trailer confirmed GTA VI will be released in 2025 and now, thanks to a new press release from Rockstar parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 
Curiously, the press release only mentions those two platforms, leaving out PC. Here's what it says: 
Despite the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, it seems like GTA VI won't be launching on PC on day one. Of course, this doesn't mean the game won't eventually make its way to PC; GTA V eventually got there (albeit about a year and a half later). And Red Dead Redemption II didn't launch on PC either. 
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar Games to ask if a PC version of GTA VI is planned and, if there is one, when it will be released, and will update this story if more is learned. 
In the meantime, read about the first official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer here, and then check out some screenshots from the trailer below:

In this first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, the highly anticipated sequel to Grand Theft Auto V more than 10 years in the making, we get a glimpse at our dual protagonists, the setting of Vice City, and more alongside a 2025 release year. A press release from Rockstar Games says the game will launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025, with no mention of PC.

        <updated>2023-12-04T20:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been a long time coming, and a new teaser trailer – arriving on Dragon Age Day, appropriately – provides a glimpse of its continent, Thedas, while also announcing when Bioware will properly reveal the game. 
The trailer provides a cinematic flyby of Thedas’ map and a few scenic shots of locales as out-of-context musings from several characters set the tone. It wraps up with a message announcing a full reveal coming next summer. 


It’s a bittersweet announcement. It’s good to know when we’ll finally see what Dreadwolf actually is. We're just bummed to get a teaser for a trailer that's months away. There’s always the chance Dreadwolf launches a few months after its grand debut (it’s happened before with several other big games), though the game was announced as being in the middle of full production last year, and with Bioware’s recent restructuring resulting in layoffs, a 2024 launch may be optimistic. 
Although Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development in some form since at least 2015, its first big teaser took place at The Game Awards in 2018. However, it didn’t get its proper title until last year. Dreadwolf has gone through the wringer in terms of development shake-ups, from high-profile departures at Bioware, including Casey Hudson (again), to EA reworking it from a live-service model to a more single-player-focused experience following Anthem’s failure. 
We still know very little about what Dreadwolf entails other than it takes place in Tevinter and will feature Solas (the titular Dread Wolf) and new characters Bellara and Davrin, whom we know nothing about as of yet. Here's hoping Bioware rolls out the carpet for the game in a big way next year after fans have waited so long to see what's next in the Dragon Age mythos.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze, the studio behind games such as Payday 3, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and The Darkness, has announced a partnership with Wizards of the Coast to develop and publish a new cooperative multiplayer game set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
The title is codenamed Project Baxter and is slated to arrive in 2026. In a press release, Starbreeze states that Baxter is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and “will carry the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-Model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.” Although D&D is a role-playing game, it's unclear what genre Project Baxter will be. 
We are excited to unveil Dungeons & Dragons® as the IP for our next game, codename ”Project Baxter”. A co-operative multiplayer title to be released on all major platforms in 2026!

December 4, 2023
Project Baxter is slated to launch on all major platforms and will feature cross-play. Starbreeze released a piece of concept artwork, posted above, as a small visual hint of what's to come.
In a year where Baldur’s Gate 3 delivered on faithfully replicating the D&D experience in video games, Starbreeze has a lot to live up to. But as a D&D fan, it’s cool to see more triple-A projects based on the license, so hopefully Project Baxter turns out well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next week, Mortal Kombat 1 is getting its second DLC fighter in the form of the Nether Realm’s favorite wizard, Quan Chi. His gameplay trailer makes no bones about the fact that he’s an extremely formidable fighter.
Quan Chi sports his usual arsenal of necromancy-based offense, such as summoning skeletons and firing skulls, but he can now conjure giant tentacles from presumably another reality. He also tag teams with upcoming Kameo fighter Khameleon, who becomes available in January. We particularly enjoy seeing Quan Chi and Shang Tsung make perhaps the most delightfully eye-rolling Deadly Alliance reference ever, plus the bonus tease of another impending guest fighter, Peacemaker, who arrives in February.  


Owners of Mortal Kombat 1’s Premium Edition or Kombat Pack get access to Quan Chi early on December 14. Everyone else will have to wait until December 21. Quan Chi follows Invincible’s Omni-Man, who hit the game last month, on the DLC character roadmap, leaving Ermac, Takeda, Peacemaker, and The Boys’ Homelander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following two years in early access, roguelite citybuilder Against The Storm has finally reached its 1.0 milestone. It’s a combination of genres that seem to pair together as naturally as sausages and strawberry jam. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of both of these things as separate entities, but together? My assumption was that they would prove too strange to stomach, but much like the cursed pork and berry snack that became a staple of my university diet, the result is a thrilling concoction that delights the palette. I’ll say it right up top: Against The Storm is one of this year’s best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming TV adaptation of Fallout. The series is set to premiere on April 12 on Amazon Prime, and this teaser proves that visually speaking, the series appears to faithfully capture the essence of Bethesda’s beloved RPG.


Fallout is brought to life by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell as a freshly emerged Vault 33 dweller named Lucy and Walton Goggins as a gunslinging ghoul aptly dubbed “The Ghoul,” and the series synopsis reads as follows:
The trailer packs in what a lot of fans would expect from a Fallout adaptation: power armor, vaults, irradiated, mutated creatures, exploding headshots, and a dark sense of humor. Here's hoping it can live up to recent live-action success stories such as The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.
What do you think of this first look at Fallout? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a weird place with the Meta Quest. It's really its own platform these days, with its own specs and increasingly divergent library of games. At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.
Also, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.

        <updated>2023-12-04T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is an enigmatic puzzle adventure game that tasks players with solving riddles to grow plants within a mysterious estate. The game first raised eyebrows during its reveal at a Nintendo Direct last November, and we can exclusively reveal that it’s arriving next spring.
Players control Arabella Greene, a retired botanist looking to bring life back to her massive collection of rare, long-lost plants. Doing this involves exploring a giant 19th-century manor in search of clues, notes, and other items to uncover the proper methods and conditions to make her plants grow. This involves finding the ideal habitats to place seedlings, for example, which may require some creative problem-solving and mature plants have mysterious qualities. 


As players find and examine clues, they’ll also learn about the ups and downs in Arabella’s life, both personally and professionally. Overall, the game has a peaceful atmosphere accented by a calming presentation and a pleasant soundtrack. Botany Manor is the debut title by the small team at Balloon Studios and is published by Whitethorn Games. 
Botany Manor is coming to Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. It will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From one AMD CPU to another - the last deal we posted was on an AM4 gaming-focused processor, the 5800X3D, and now we're looking at the opposite end of Team Red's lineup: the 7950X. This Zen 4 design includes 16 cores and 32 threads, making it their ultimate consumer CPU for highly threaded workloads like video production, 3D rendering... and yes, many video games too! 
This is still a pretty expensive processor, but it's a relative steal versus its launch price of £770. Amazon are now asking just £483 for this flagship-grade model, and that seems a fair price given just how well this CPU performs in everything from games to scientific computing and video rendering.

As for whether we’ll barrel straight into Resident Evil 5 from this year’s RE4 Remake or jump back to Zero or even, uh, sideways to Code Veronica? They won’t say - yet.

I'll put my hands up here - I really did intend to review this one properly when it came out back in July, and I regret never quite getting round to it. Time, as ever, escaped me in the run-up to Gamescom, but it was also one of the first games in a while where I felt I wasn't quite equipped to do it justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside a new trailer showing what Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will sound like in English, Sega also confirmed Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name's English dub will release for free this month. The new trailer shows scenes that will be familiar to anyone who watched the Japanese trailer back in September, but it's nice to hear familiar voices connected to this new footage. The trailer also gives us a chance to hear Daniel Dae Kim's Masataka Ebina and Danny Trejo's Dwight. Here's what Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has to say about the two characters.
Ebina is the de-facto leader for the Seiryu Clan, a yakuza syndicate whose current chairman is incarcerated. Dwight leads the Barracudas gang in Hawaii and supervises the world's largest counterfeit goods market, aided by his sharp sense of business and even sharper machete.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth releases January 26 PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out CD Projekt has even more plans for Cyberpunk beyond its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty earlier this year. During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.
The metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to "quality time" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.
As stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms. To read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review, follow the link. You can also read our Phantom Liberty review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.
pic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt
December 1, 2023
Rockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is "Trailer 1" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, "We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto," it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.
The art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.


If you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

I mean, just look at this trailer for Ironwood's Vandemeerian vehicle survival roguelike Pacific Drive. How am I supposed to be satisfied with some stupid road after watching that? What's the point of cars if there are no floating cryptid lifeforms, inexplicable walls of energy or lost research facilities involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, previously described by Ed as "an exciting action-RPG mix of Elden Ring and God Of War" has a new trailer - and cat-lovers, you are in for a treat, because this game has a cat called Enki which you can use as a magic grappling hook and a handy source of lightning for your groundpounds. Enki has big cute ears and a beaver's tail, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's related to one of those awful, many-limbed gods Flintlock's protagonist Nor Vanek is trying to slay. 


I'm sorry, it's my first time writing about Flintlock, and I realise the "OMG it has a cat!" ship has probably long since sailed. Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as "fox-like", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.

Adventure mode is a procedurally generated RPG campaign in which you control just a single character, and it's now on its way to Kitfox's DF-with-graphics Steam release in April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted stream may have been mostly focused on games we already knew about, but there were a couple of surprises hidden away in there, too. One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.
