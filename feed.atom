        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best stages of fighting games transport us to an exciting arena. It could be a stunning wilderness, a ruckus crowd, or an ancient temple. What's most important is how they set the tone of the fight and if the intractable nature of the stage is well suited to a fighting game. Let's hear the roar of the crowd and get stuck in on what makes an exciting fighting game stage.

The stunning setting from stages of fighting games
Arguably, the most important element is the graphics of each stage. There's always a balance between being too simple and too distracting. For example, I hate it when pro fighting game players always pick the plain white training stages during EVO or local meetups that take me out…]]></summary>

As per usual, this includes the additions coming in the first half of the month. Typically more titles are added in the middle of the month as well. Also, even though it was technically highlighted in the July update, Celeste is part of the Game Pass as of today... which is August 1. So that's part of August as well.
It's looking like August will be another month for indie titles, with games like A Short Hike and Broforce Forever.
City building and management game Airborne Kingdom comes to Game Pass later this month as well, which looks like it could be a lot of fun. In Airborne Kingdom we get to build a unique town amongst the clouds as it flies across a wide-open landsca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has revealed a new Stormcloud Vapor special edition Xbox Series X/S controller, and it looks great.
The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today. It will cost $69.99 and you can purchase it from Xbox’s online store, Microsoft stores, and some local retailers. The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers. 
Microsoft says the design is inspired by clouds and storming skies, “with each billowing puff of vapor bringing a unique design to each controller,” hence the Stormcloud Vapor name. It features rubberized, blue diamond-pattern grips and can hook up to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, PC, mobile phones, and tablets. 
Purchasing this controller also gives you a unique Stormcloud Vapor dynamic background that you can check out in motion in the video below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Published by TinyBuild and developed by Mandragora, the cozy post-apocalyptic survival game, I Am Future, is coming to Steam Early Access on August 8. With that date fast approaching, they’ve released a new trailer highlighting all the features of it.
https://youtu.be/EHwI-4IxivY
I kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.
So, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.
I Am Future is launching into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.
I Am Future launches into Steam Early Access on August 8. No other platforms have been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alliance Arts has announced it will be publishing The Great Villainess: Strategy of Lily. Created by developers One or Eight (Lost Epic), WSS Playground (Needy Streamer Overload), and Alliance Art themselves, it’s a strange twist on a turn-based strategy and is coming to PC in 2024.
You play as Duchess Scarlet, who is sentenced to execution for regicide. Head still connected to her shoulders, she escapes with the help of Lily. She’s turned into a prototypical streamer with the ability to incite people into acting out. She uses her newfound powers to capture enemy commanders and intends to “break” the world.

It looks like things are still rather early in development, but the aesthetic seems to be in place and looks great. 2D characters have an ornate anime look to them, and the 3D world has a voxel appearance. The world, with its heavy depth-of-field blur, reminds me of 3D Dot Game Heroes. It’s just very bright and colorful.
There’s also some flirtation going on between Lily and Scarlet, so I’m down for that. I’m not sure about the gameplay. The combat is shown, but I can’t grok the mechanics. It kind of reminds me of that Mii samurai game on 3DS, Warriors Way. Hard to say.
I guess we’ll find out for sure when The Great Villainess: Strategy of Lily launches on PC in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're rapidly approaching the long-awaited release of Baldur's Gate 3 after an extended period of Early Access. However, Larian Studios has stated that the game won't support preloading ahead of its launch. If you've pre-ordered the game and want to jump in as soon as possible, prepare to set aside some time to download this hefty title.
[caption id="attachment_393716" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Larian Studios.[/caption]
Baldur's Gate 3's release date draws nearer
Baldur's Gate 3 will arrive on PC on August 3 at 5 PM CEST, and PS5 on September 6. An Xbox Series X/S port is also in development, although it has yet to receive a release date. Like other titles in the series, players will be able to create their own characters and partake in a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired campaign.
In a community update on Steam, the developers confirmed that preloading is off the table for Baldur's Gate 3. In other words, players can't install the game ahead of its release. This would have been useful for a game like Baldur's Gate 3 which will weigh approximately 122 GB.
There are a few other things Baldur's Gate 3 fans should know about. Though the game has been available in Early Access, progress made here will not transfer to the final game. Nevertheless, the game will feature cross-save capabilities, allowing you to begin your adventure on PC and continue on PS5 later if you wish.
It fortunately appears that making the game easily accessible is a priority for the developers. Those who purchase Baldur's Gate 3 for PC will receive access to both the Mac and Windows versions, though the Mac version will arrive at a later date. Larian Studios also wants the game Steam Deck Verified by launch, as it is already optimized for the handheld.
With the game's large size, players may have to wait a bit at launch before they can dive in. However, the Early Access version should give you a good idea of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is a game with lots of brilliant individual stories in it, even the ones that end so catastrophically badly that redemption seems nigh on impossible. But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh boy.
The latest UK Charts are in and they paint a decidedly glum picture for Disney Illusion Island, which debuts at number eighteen, behind the likes of other Switch exclusives such as Pikmin 4, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The game launched on July 28th, 2023 at an RRP of £34.99.
Elsewhere, it's a familiar story for the Switch, with the usual suspects such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Minecraft all making an appearance in the top 10. Meanwhile, FIFA 23 retains the crown at number one, with the Switch version selling particularly well to make up an impressive 46% of the platform split.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Reptile has been hard at work on their latest title, a spiritual successor in gameplay and style to Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio Future. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's sleek cel-shaded, Dreamcast-esque graphics are just the start. Team Reptile wants to bring the whole shebang together with music from Hideki Naganuma, the man behind the original. Now, their latest trailer shows a whole lot of what's to come, and for more platforms.
Bomb Rush Cyberfunk was already locked in for Nintendo Switch and PC, but Team Reptile has confirmed it will also launch on Xbox and PlayStation, albeit a little later. Xbox and PlayStation owners will be able to check out the Jet Set successor on September 1, a few weeks after its August 18 release for PC and Switch.

The Latest Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Trailer
The trailer still keeps the mystery of what's going on in the game, as Team Reptile has been very tight-lipped about what Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is going to actually be about. However, the latest trailer teases a bit more. For one, much like it's spiritual predecessor, players will have the choice of choosing between multiple characters. There also styles including BMX, skating, and skateboarding.
We also get a look at some drone enemies, which may take the antagonistic role, like the Tokyo-to Police in JSR. There's also a strange monochromatic environment. Although what it means is still up in the air.
Alongside all there, there are other gangs, antagonistic presences, and many other forces at work in the city. None of it's clear just yet, but we'll probably find out more at launch. There's also another excellent track in the trailer, "Operator" by GRRL.
The truth will be revealed when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk releases on September 1st for Playstation, Xbox, and PC, and August 18 for Nintendo Switch

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the success of the Steam Deck, manufacturers have been warming to the idea of a portable PC, and more competitors are throwing their hats into the ring. The latest reports suggest that Lenovo may be the next to release a handheld gaming PC.
[caption id="attachment_394544" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Lenovo Legion.[/caption]
Lenovo could have a handheld gaming PC on the way
According to a report from Windows Central, the device is called the Legion Go. It will compete with the Steam Deck and the recently released Asus ROG Ally, and it's expected to sport an 8-inch display, which would make it larger than its direct competitors, which both feature 7-inch displays.
The rumored gadget will run Windows 11, and it will be powered by AMD's new Phoenix processors, which could result in a powerful system. Revealed this year, the processors are used in several gaming machines including the Razer Blade 14 (2023), Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, and Acer Nitro 16.
None of the reports have been confirmed by Lenovo, though if true, this won't be the company's first foray into the handheld gaming market. An Android-based cloud gaming device called the Legion Play was never officially released, though a few prototype units went on sale in China.
The Go would expand the Legion range of gaming PCs which includes laptops such as 2023's Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8. Windows Central does not report a release date for the Go, though Lenovo will have to hurry if it wishes to secure a spot for itself in the growing handheld gaming PC market.

Most recently, Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons were added to the Switch's ever-growing Game Boy library, giving many a fan the chance to play the oft-overlooked GBC titles for the first time.

Not only is the title itself incredibly similar to the iconic PlayStation franchise, but The Last Hope also borrows heavily from The Last of Us in numerous ways, including gameplay mechanics, story elements, and even character designs (except it was ruddy awful - just check out Push Square's gameplay video if you need proof). Take a look at the girl in the image above, for example; doesn't she look almost exactly like Ellie?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, "Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it." It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.
It was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dishonored 2 is an immersive sim stealth 'em up by Arkane and it's been in my brain a lot more than usual. Partly due to this year's RPS 100, but also because of the mess that was Redfall. Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.
I think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present. While I can't look into the future, I still think there's worth in turning to an all-time classic of a stealth level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because, why not?
Publisher Wired Productions and developer Angry Demon Studio have released a new trailer for their upcoming hack 'n' slash title, Gori: Cuddly Carnage.
Built on Unreal Engine 5, the game currently doesn't have a firm release date in place, but judging from this latest footage, it definitely looks like one to keep a close eye on in the coming months. It looks utterly ridiculous and insanely fun in equal measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.
The Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show.

We love Stardew Valley. We love space. It makes sense that One Lonely Outpost, a Stardew-inspired planet terraformer, immediately ticked two of our boxes when it launched on Steam early access back in June and now developer and publisher Freedom Games has stated that a Switch port is on the way.
We don't have a precise console release date for this one just yet, but from what we have seen so far, we can imagine the space farm sim being right at home on Switch. One Lonely Planet will see you starting a life on the distant world of Calypso, building a civilisation from the ground up as you plant, grow and build a functioning little space colony.

The process begins with excruciating headaches, escalates to fingers twisting by themselves, and culminates with an octopus head spouting out of the body. That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites "tie into" its RPG systems. Yep, you can choose to either embrace or resist the tempting corruption, with the former giving you some pretty cool party tricks, while the latter means you won’t be subjected to David Cronenberg-esque body horror. Tough decision, I think.

If you've been enjoying exploring Hyrule again in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then you might be interested in a new statue that's been making the rounds recently.
As noted by Kotaku (thanks, GoNintendo), this 1/4 scale statue — created by 'Wake Studio' — depicts Link riding a Zonai 'Airbike' while a poor Bokoblin is practically incinerated by an explosion below. It's wild stuff and this is only accentuated by an LED light from within the explosion itself, meaning you can gaze upon its wonder when you're in bed at night playing your Switch in portable mode. As you do.

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life sprouted back onto Switch earlier this summer, reintroducing us to the farm sim world that we first visited on the GameCube in 2003. Cashing in on this cross-generational appeal, publisher Marvelous Europe has released a new post-launch trailer for the game titled 'Precious Memories', and it's packed full of wholesome nostalgia.
The trailer shows just how long the farm sim series has been around (albeit, under a different name) as we watch a young gamer move from playing Harvest Moon on the SNES, through to handing on the latest Switch game to his child 25 years later. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, you must admit that's a cute sentiment.

Nintendo has a great track record with its development partners, but not everyone has necessarily found it to be an easy process. Jupiter Corporation - the Japanese developer behind the Picross series on the Switch - recently revealed the difficulties of working with the video game giant.
Speaking to VGC, Jupiter's managing director Norichika Meguro mentioned how the team was eager to work with Nintendo on a collaborative project for the 30th anniversary of the Picross series in 2025, but had been having trouble getting the Mario developer to "say yes" to a pitch. In fact, it's apparently become "more difficult than ever" to work through Nintendo's approval process.

        <updated>2023-07-31T22:00:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Pat Naoum has just launched The Master's Pupil, a game that's the culmination of seven years of hand-painted work.
If there's any doubt, Pat explains that he didn't merely use his hands to pick up an electronic stylus to draw the game on some fancy art tablet. Naoum made every single aspect of The Master's Pupil old-school style before using a high-resolution film negative scanner to bring his beautiful artwork into the game's world.
https://www.tiktok.com/@patnaoumgames/video/7257654317488819458
But what's the game even like?
The Master's Pupil is a 12-level 2D sidescroller. It invites players to go on a puzzle-solving adventure that accompanies some of the most important moments in the life of Claude Monet, the 19th-century French impressionist painter whose works informed the game.
Don't let yourself get fooled by all the beauty, though. Great sadness lives underneath. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that players will have to suffer through the loss of someone very dear to Monet. They will also experience his fight against sight ailments that nearly took away his ability to create art in the way that he loved.
[caption id="attachment_394527" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image by Pat Naoum[/caption]
At certain points in the game, the entire level will transform to reveal a Monet painting. The way that the various layers come together to form paintings feels reminiscent of Braid, but the art on display here is on a whole other level. Even if it doesn't seem like your kind of game, you should consider giving it a try. The Master's Pupil feels like one of those one-of-a-kind experiences that you soon won't forget.
The Master's Pupil is available on PC and Mac via Steam. It's also on the Nintendo Switch.

I was inspired to try out the Deception series by community member Kerrik52. My only previous experience was watching a roommate try out 2005’s Trapt. However, upon looking at screenshots of Tecmo’s Deception, I fell in love.
Released in 1996, Tecmo’s Deception is just so PS1. While it established the foundation of the long-running series, it mostly failed spectacularly at everything it attempted. However, its King’s Field style first-person perspective and boxy, pixellated graphics just feel so cozy. A lot of what it failed to do was dropped by subsequent games in the series, which almost makes me feel like I won’t like them as much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!

In the report, several key partners to Nintendo have claimed to have received development kits for the new console. Development kits for consoles are typically sent out well before the retail release so developers learn the new hardware and ensure some titles are ready to launch on the new platform.
The sources went on to share some alleged details on the new system. Like the Nintendo Switch, the next-gen console will have portable mode. Furthermore, the console will launch with an LCD screen rather than an OLED screen to reduce costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought the Skyrim community was done with modding, think again. There are countless ways to tinker with Bethesda's epic fantasy RPG, especially if you play the game on PC. Now, for those who want to see dinosaurs roaming this cold slice of Tamriel, there's a mod that could be right up your alley.
Over on Nexus Mods, user Birbwalker21 (who's done numerous dinosaur-themed mods in the past) brings us "Raptors" for the special edition of Skyrim. As the name implies, this particular download fills the world of Tamriel with a bunch of different raptors for that dose of prehistoric role-playing.
https://youtu.be/0gJxi5xWUK4
It's interesting to note that these particular dinosaurs have been given feathers, which research has shown is what the real beasts would have had, as opposed to the scaly creatures seen in popular culture.
Dr. Alan Grant, if he was a Dragonborn
It's not just one raptor, either. Birbwalker21 has added three different types of raptors to Skyrim. The first one (called the Forest Raptor) is based on the Velociraptor, which many of you will know from Jurassic Park. These can be identified by their black and orange feathers and are typically found in woodland areas.
Next is the Alpine Raptor, designed after the Deinonychus. This is a larger raptor you'll come across in the higher and more northerly areas of Tamriel. They sport blue feathers with white crests.
Then there's the Plains Raptor, which is based on the larger still Utahraptor. They're said to be the fiercest of the bunch when encountered in Skyrim. You can spot them through their brown feathers, but you may want to give them a wide berth, given their aggressive nature.
It's great to see new things still being added to this 11-year-old game. Who knows what the Dragonborn will encounter next? Dragons, perhaps? Or is that too farfetched?

Though it has plenty of nostalgic value, Sonic Team will not be returning to 2017's Sonic Mania. In a recent interview with Game Informer, Sega explained why this is the case.

What happened to Sonic Mania 2?
Sonic Mania was a success that sold over a million copies in its first year of release. This might have indicated a sequel could happen, but that hasn’t panned out. In the interview, Sonic Team’s Takashi Iizuka revealed that the plan was originally to make a new Sonic game in the classic style following Sonic Mania.

It happened in Yellowstone National Park. Removed from society, cruelly separated from cell phone service, I’d embarked, begrudgingly, upon a technology cleanse. I was receiving no texts, no emails, no DMs, no WhatsApps; I had only the park’s sullen, rag-faced buffalo and hypnotic, deadly thermal pools to keep me company. Ultimately, the lack of contact was transformative, healing; it allowed me to be present and to engage all of my senses. Then, one day, during a particularly meditative hike, I noticed an innocuous pile of lumber along a trail.

        <updated>2023-07-31T16:00:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Half-Life 2. For many, Valve's follow-up to the influential 1998 FPS is the developer's magnum opus. It still holds up today and is often held aloft as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Much of it comes down to its tight combat, intriguing story, and dystopian setting.
But what was life like for the people of City 17 before the Combine came and wrecked everything? Before the famed Seven-Hour War would see humanity become enslaved? Well, that's what YouTuber Radiation Hazard wondered. In a recent video of theirs (and using beta footage from the game), they showed what Half-Life 2 looked like long before Gordon Freeman came into the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_KQ725AAI
The result is what you would expect. With no war and no Combine, the city and its surroundings are as they should be. No damaged structures. No wreckage. No enslaved humans.
Maybe we'll go to Ravenholm now
Even Ravenholm (where the game turns into a horror experience) looks positively tranquil before everything went to shit. True, Radiation Hazard's video only shows the mining town in the daylight, but it's still a stark contrast to see this abandoned and dilapidated locale actually looking habitable.
However, it still feels a little bit...eerie. Maybe it's the fact that Half-Life 2's setting is largely industrial, including almost brutalist buildings, or the fact that even in a non-Combine inhabited city, there are still no people milling about, but it still looks quite oppressive.
It kind of shows Valve's skills in being able to invoke a mood. Even without the carnage, corpses, and graffiti, Half-Life 2 still looks like a place that one probably wouldn't want to visit. Which makes sense. The game probably wouldn't feel right if Freeman had to defend an idyllic fishing village from the Combine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purveyor of fine retro-pop interface devices, 8BitDo, has announced their latest creation, a retro-styled mechanical keyboard. It comes in two flavors, NES or Famicom.
The 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard has options for wired, Bluetooth, or 2.4GHz use, much like many of their controllers. The keys can be mapped if you have a DVORAK preference. They don’t say what kind of mechanical switches the keys use, but they do say that the PCB is hot-swappable, so you can buy it for the aesthetic and trade out switches to your preference. The battery will last 200 hours on a 4-hour charge, which should cover your travel needs.
[caption id="attachment_393903" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by 8BitDo[/caption]
Hilariously, the images depict these two big A and B buttons that the presser just kind of glosses over. They’re kind of mentioned as “Super Buttons,” but I’m not sure what you’d use them for. Maybe you could map Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to them. I’d kind of like to map them to left-click and then use them to play The Coin Game for that little immersive flair.
It’s nice to see that 8BitDo has started targeting me, specifically. I wasn’t exactly in the market for a new keyboard, but even my husband said, “Yeah, you’re totally getting one of those.” The only downside is that they don’t have numpads, which I actually use on occasion. Maybe I’ll just buy a separate numpad elsewhere to go alongside it. Now, would I prefer the NES or Famicom version? Tough choice.
I don’t have much time to suppress my impulses, as pre-orders for the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard are starting on Amazon right now for $99.99. It’s expected to start shipping out on August 10, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

The FAQ section states the team feels "very confident in getting everything into the game by April 2025." I'll have the rat-rat-rat-tan chant stuck in my head until then.


Original Story: Patapon’s beloved blend of rhythm and strategy has been sadly relegated to PlayStation consoles, but a new spiritual successor is bringing that cutesy charm to PC as long as the game finds success on Kickstarter. Ratatan was announced at this year’s Bitsummit, and it’s coming from developer Ratata Arts who are led by developers who worked on the original Patapon series. The newest trailer (below) shows off the game’s adorable singing soldiers. Take a look.

Despite the ongoing success of the Nintendo Switch, talk of an inevitable successor appears to be gaining traction with each passing day. Now, according to a recent report, it looks like Nintendo may be targeting a 2024 release for its next major piece of hardware.
Thanks to VGC (and corroborated by Eurogamer), it looks like development kits for Nintendo's next console are now with "key partner studios", with multiple sources claiming that Nintendo is aiming to release the final product in the second half of 2024. This is supposedly to avoid any stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S when they both launched back in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Editor's Note: This story previously stated that two new Mortal Kombat 1 trailers were released over the weekend and linked to a Geras trailer for Mortal Kombat 11. It has been updated to reflect that only one trailer was released – the Keepers of Time trailer – which reveals Geras as a playable fighter.]]></summary>

It probably has something to do with the fact that I live in a small, redneck part of California where white people loudly complain about the number of Mexican restaurants in town. Listening to that crap day in and day out, it’s no wonder I’m always jumping at the chance to discover something beyond my powder-white existence.
That’s why I was excited to play Venba, a narrative-driven cooking game that takes the idea of Cooking Mama and transports it to an immigrant family’s house in the 1980s. It’s a darling game, but it might be hard to justify the price, given how fleeting it is.

Here’s a recipe for a good game: a meaty cross-cultural story, a dash of delicious food, and a dollop of fun, cosy gameplay. Those are the ingredients of Venba, and mixed together – and topped with a reference to Ratatouille – they form a wonderful narrative-led game that had us wanting seconds.
Visai Studios has dished up a title that takes you through the life of a woman named Venba, her husband Paavalan, and their son Kavin. It begins not long after Venba and Paavalan have moved from India to Canada, and charts their lives as they struggle to find work, adjust to a new country, and raise Kavin in a way that meets his desire to fit in with his friends while keeping his roots intact.

But as a second-generation immigrant, the game’s explorations of that experience hit so surprisingly close to home that I wasn’t left hungry by the time credits rolled. Venba is a touching, smart, and soulful game that made me want to hug everyone in my family immediately. Though, I do wish the game would’ve marinated in its good ideas a while longer.

Since the launch of the PS5, audiophiles have asked for Dolby Atmos audio support on the console. Without diving too deep into the nitty gritty, Dolby Atmos is one of the best audio formats when adequately supported. While the PS5’s 3D Tempest audio tech is impressive, players have also wished for Dolby Atmos support. And now, with the latest system software beta, it has arrived.

Nejvíce témat však mají, jak je zvykem, ze světa hadwaru - uvidíte PCI-E karty s atomovými hodinami, které byly k vidění na summitu v Praze, identifikátor chemických látek na bázi Ramanova rozptylu, rozpustné ekologické DPS nebo open source PLC.

Z podivností tentokrát vybrali návrh a simulaci cívek v Blenderu, kterak jsou IMAX kina ovládána emulovaným PDA Palm nebo jak fungovala bezbateriová dálková ovládání k televizi v 50. letech, kdy o power harvestingu ještě nemohla být ani řeč.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 1. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později).

It’s not that I don’t like Elden Ring. I’m not struggling to connect with its open world take on the Souls genre. I’m not put off by the difficult encounters that await me, or the obtuse challenges I’ll be forced to overcome. The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customisation, language options, and more.
Forever Entertainment has revealed a brand new trailer for the upcoming Switch release of Front Mission 2: Remake, showcasing some of the game's key features.
We get a short look at some of the 'Wanzer' customisation, the modernised battle scenes, and the nine language localisation options.

A novel aspect of the injunction is that it grants Sky the ability to protect specific content, such as a major TV show, by blocking certain piracy services at certain times. Precise details are confidential but it's not too difficult to arrive at a credible theory.

Sometimes, it's just hard to come up with a story that beats the one we all already love. Games don't have that problem as making a better game usually requires the developers to just read player feedback and improve upon the original's gameplay shortcomings. That's, however, not the case in every single video game sequel. There's a surprisingly high number of once-promising sequels that fumble hilariously in places where the original triumphed.

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking out into 3D.
Following up on one of the most beloved entries in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is no easy task, but for the ex-Sonic Mania devs at Evening Star, it was a simple case of leaning into their considerable ambition and diving headfirst into the world of 3D.
Announced earlier this year during a Nintendo Direct presentation, the studio's debut title, Penny's Big Breakaway, caused a big stir amongst not only Sonic fans but 3D platforming fans in general thanks to its bold art style and kinetic gameplay. Currently slated for release in early 2024, it's shaping up to be one of the Switch's most promising 3D platformers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With about a month and a half to launch, NetherRealm is keeping its foot on the gas pedal when it comes to revealing characters for Mortal Kombat 1. Less than 10 days after announcing the return of Tanya, Li Mei, and Baraka, the developer is back with a new trailer. But this one is focused on just one fighter: Geras. This time manipulator is the first character from Mortal Kombat 11 to be confirmed for MK1, bringing along some new moves that look slow but are sure to be powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72okJYRJWDI
I'm still not totally on board with the Kameo system, but watching him swing Darrius around sure looks fun.
I didn't expect any of the three new fighters from MK11 to show up in Mortal Kombat 1, but it's nice to see the team isn't limiting itself to picking from the old games only. There are still a few weeks between now and launch, which means there is still plenty of time for Meat and Mokap to get redemption. Three of my favorites are already confirmed (Smoke, Rain, Kenshi), but there are a few fighters who made their debut in Mortal Kombat X that I'd love to see make the cut too. Surely I'm not the only one who wants Erron Black back.
Mortal Kombat 1 is set to release on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC. As a reminder, the first Kombat Pack for the game has been revealed and will include returning Kombatants, as well as Peacemaker, Homelander, and Omni-Man.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More options are always a good thing, especially in the world of gaming, and particularly in regions that don't have many choices of where to buy the latest games and hardware. Thankfully, Nintendo just opened up their services in Australia.
As pointed out by Vooks.net, My Nintendo Australia storefront is now selling physical games (as well as hardware). Previously the system would just provide rewards and exclusives, but now you can shop with them directly. There's 46 games for sale at the time of publication, as well as multiple variations of the Switch (including the OLED and Tears of the Kingdom OLED), on top of Pro Controllers and Switch Lite models.
Vooks notes that this is also a big deal because Nintendo hasn't sold Australian customers games directly before. The only catch is that the minimum free shipping order has been bumped up from $80 to $100.
My Nintendo stores are actually pretty robust, so this is good news for Australia
I don't know if you've ever looked at your respective My Nintendo storefront, but in some regions, it has a massive/surprising amount of inventory and SKUs. The US version has games, hardware, merch, and exclusives: they even sell accessories like the Pokemon Go Plus+ (ha, I still can't get used to this name).
Some lines (like Pikmin) even have a full section, with multiple games and pieces of merch. It's not always the best option, but it's an option nonetheless that I use a few times a year.

        <updated>2023-07-29T14:00:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, developers of the long-awaited and just-long Baldur's Gate 3, have unveiled the trailer for the villainous Orin the Red. She's a master shapeshifter and one-third of a triumvirate of main villains that players will have to deal with in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_nOikdM7oo
Orin will create many challenges for players as she has the ability to shapeshift into any person in the world. This means we probably won't get the chance to trust any NPC we come across in the game, or perhaps even worse. It's likely that she will, at some point, replace one of our companions without us noticing, so keep an ever-watchful eye. Also, many call her a "great master" of murder, so she's perhaps also good at doing other even viler stuff.
The voice and motion behind Orin are those of Maggie Robertson. Most players will recognize her as Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village. She describes Orin as a "very disturbing figure". Joining Maggie to form the villainous trio will be J.K Simmons of Whiplash and Invincible fame, as well as Jason Isaacs from that thing with the kid wizard.
[caption id="attachment_394178" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Simmons will portray General Ketheric Thorm, a military leader who's seemingly unkillable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOqD3uATwSc
Isaacs will portray Lord Enver Gortash, a sleazy politician hellbent on conquering Baldur's Gate. He'll seemingly try to convince the main character to join forces with him on his quest. That's cool, but I'm guessing he doesn't have the best of intentions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUcZYW43_pQ
We can barely wait to kill the three of them.
Baldur's Gate 3 will come out on August 3 on Steam and GOG. PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait until it releases on September 6. There's still no word on the Xbox Series X|S release.

It's very sweet. I like games where it's like you're smashing lovely toys together. I've already played that, though, I'm telling you that maybe you'll like it.

In fact, the new league for the first game has been revealed as Path of Exile: Trial of the Ancestors, and it will launch on August 18. The current PoE league, Crucible, has gone a little longer than usual due to the timing of ExileCon.

Trial of the Ancestors will feature a new league mechanic where you create a team to enter gladiator-style battles in a tournament setting. Like most PoE leagues, a plethora of new content will also launch with the new league.

With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.

Bosses, in particular, will pose much more of a threat this time round, as studio co-founder and Path Of Exile 2 creative director Jonathan Rogers says the big monsters you fought in the first game's campaign were, in hindsight, "pretty anemic".

The news comes from tonight's ExileCon, which also marks the first time we've seen Path Of Exile 2 in action since that original announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During ExileCon, Grinding Gear Games revealed that as Path of Exile 2 grew since its announcement in 2019, they realized it was no longer just an expansion to Path of Exile as originally planned. With over 100 developers working on Path of Exile 2, it has become a much bigger project than originally anticipated. Moving forward, Path of Exile 2 will now be its own standalone title. Each game will still be supported and have its own unique mechanics, leagues, and features.
However, microtransactions and cosmetics will be cross-compatible across both games unless it's not possible. For example, Druid is an ascendancy in PoE2 but not in PoE. Therefore, a Druid-specific cosmetic for PoE2 will not be available in PoE where Druid does not exist.

Among the announcements of an expansion and new platform being in the mix, one of the biggest rounds of applause came for something that seems a little less grandiose, at least to less XIV-familiar folks: two dyes per gear piece.
It sounds plain, but it's a notable piece of what's looking like a big update for the fashion fans of Final Fantasy XIV. Which, really, is everyone. The big non-secret of Final Fantasy XIV is that the endgame is not Ultimate raids, or hardcore Crystalline Conflict, or even necessarily maxing out all the jobs. Those are all things you do in service of the true Final Fantasy XIV endgame: fashion. And boy howdy, did the feral fashion aficionados get…]]></summary>

As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…]]></summary>

I’m not a competitive person by nature, and it’s a genre that is built around competition. The two times I really got into fighting games were a rivalry with my brother-in-law around Street Fighter II and another with a college friend over Soul Calibur 3. I still play them with some regularity, but I just have a hard time falling into them and continuing after beating the arcade mode a couple of times.
1997’s Bloody Roar was recommended to me a few times, but I only now got around to playing it. This is despite owning a copy of it, given to me by a friend who was cleaning out their basement. If I had known how firmly I would click with it, I would have definitely gotten around to it sooner.

This Campfire Chat primarily focuses on the upcoming 1.1.1. patch as part of their promise to provide balance changes and discussion before a patch rather than afterward.
My initial response is mostly positive. The Sorcerer changes are pretty monumental, offering improved survivability and removing some of the unnecessary annoyances the class has. But, we have to keep in mind just how disappointing patch 1.1.0 was across the board. It's never a net positive if you're taking one step forward but just recently took three steps back. Join me as we dive into the July 28 patch 1.1.1 Diablo 4 Campfire Chat recap.

In addition to that, there will also be a physical release of the two titles combined with the NES Double Dragon 1-3 as well as the modern Double Dragon IV. Unfortunately, the physical collection is Asia only.
Super Double Dragon is the fourth-ish title in the series. It was also the last one to be worked on by the series' original developer, Technos. Although, series director Yoshihisa Kishimoto did return for 2017’s Double Dragon IV. Which is funny to me because he is credited with working on Super Double Dragon. So Double Dragon IV isn’t really the fourth official title in the series? Agh, my head hurts.

The big news is, of course, the reveal of 7.0 and the new expansion, Dawntrail. It'll see the Warrior of Light (that's you, player) set off for the New World that's been mentioned in content like the Blue Mage quests, now officially named as Tural.
And the Scions will be getting deeply involved with the local politics again, it seems. A competition for the throne is heating up, which draws the WoL and friends in, and may even see the Scions face off on opposite sides. It's intriguing, for sure. Though it's some testy potential subject matter to handle, the tropical setting does make for a great showcase of all the graphical upda…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here's what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment "in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future," perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. 
For more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

Sonic Superstars aims to give players an experience loyal to those initial Classic Sonic entries on the Genesis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's DualSense controller is one of the premiere options on PC, offering enhanced trigger rumble ('adaptive triggers') in a handful of games on top of excellent ergonomics and high-quality buttons that are much appreciated in a huge number of racing, action and other titles. These controllers normally cost around £50 to £60, but today they're down to £40 – as part of a Sony summer sale that sees the Sony console drop from £479 to £399. 
There are a wide range of colours available, far beyond the white models that launched with the console in 2020. I'm a fan of the black and camouflage options, but there's also red, pink and blue. Here are links to Amazon and Currys, with the latter offering all colours apart from purple at £40 at the time of writing and Amazon only for black, white and blue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a complicated relationship with retro-style games in general, and no particular fondness for the Everything Was Nintendo school. Or platformers, or double jumping, or dashing, or neon, or being alive in general. Dislike is the wrong word, but "weary neutrality" about covers my feelings when another retro platformer comes down the game tubes.
Gravity Circuit, however, is good enough that I can't not mention it here. It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia. I'm saying it's good, yeah? Maybe not quite for me, but good anyway.

It’s a meaty and satisfying action-platformer with possibly the best-executed comedy and character work of the entire series; a series that’s essentially grown up alongside me, in tone as much as technical sophistication. I wish I had the time to review it properly but, with a weekend and a Baldur's Gate 3-shaped boulder bearing down, I’m staying in my hardware lane to focus on the performance of and best settings to use in Rift Apart’s new PC version.

Everyone on the team has such varied, individual tastes, and it heartens me to see so many different genres and types of games represented every year. This year's list (available to read now in Part One and Part Two is another great testament to that. 
But as we (sometimes) jokingly say any time we compile a big list like this, the games that didn't make the cut are always at #101. Well, this year I thought supporters might like to see those games at #101 this year, and crikey, there are a lot. There are so many here, in fact, that we would have had to have stretched to an RPS 200 to include them all. So here are our honourable mentions this year (listed, for ease), and I'd love to see you try and guess which games belonged to which member of the team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been about an hour since Evelyn Mansell - one of the lead art directors on the System Shock remake - and I started talking about guns. Specifically the big, daft chunky guns that she worked on, but also about videogame guns in general - what makes them tick. What separates a good one from a bad one. Whether or not Doom 3’s shotgun is one of the good ones (it is).  


If there’s one area where all of the remake’s ideas truly come together and shine, it’s in the weapons. There wasn’t much to see in the original - nothing beyond the tip of a barrel. Here, the weapons are very much the star of the show. Heavy, industrial things covered in thumb-print smeared LCD screens and superfluous greeblies. NERF guns that've been painted by a 12-year-old and covered in spaceship parts. These are the toy guns you would have wanted for Christmas, and I wanted to know more about them.

It’s a 2D side-scroller that remixes the linear progression with roguelite elements and packages the whole thing with an appealing pixel art presentation. Too bad it…

I'd much rather solve the puzzle by battering it with my fist so the pieces go flying everywhere, or turn my pointer into a fist so I can batter the dialogue out of the dialogue box and watch the wizard's words spill onto the dirt like I've just shaken an open can of spaghettios.
Unpacking, a game where you click on items and shelve them nicely, has somehow tamed my urge to punch the boxes open. Except it's done one thing to personally attack me, and that's by not allowing me to unpack stuff and leave it on the floor. It's a fight I simply can't win.

        <updated>2023-07-27T15:24:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. 
Sony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. 


That’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.
However, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.


SEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it:

So that got us to thinking: what in the darn heck is a spiritual successor anyway? Are there standard parameters? We have a definitional argument, as is our wont.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entropy Centre is now available on Switch, and you can pick it up from the Nintendo eShop for 50% off, thanks to a special launch day discount. 
If you like a good puzzle game, especially if you’re a fan of Valve’s Portal series, The Entropy Centre is worth your time. It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre. With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. 
Check out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: 


The Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor. 
For more about the game, watch this gameplay trailer and then read Game Informer’s review of The Entropy Centre.

Disney Illusion Island puts Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy front and center in a Metroidvania adventure, and the result is mostly successful. Where most platformers dole out fun using the adrenaline-inducing triumph of challenge, Illusion Island is instead built around the joy of movement, thanks in part to its combat-less exploration, and the delight of controlling some of the most recognizable mascots in the world. It plays a bit floaty and simple, especially for seasoned fans of the genre, and I wanted my platforming prowess pushed more, but Illusion Island is still a…]]></summary>

Developers Paradox Tectonic have pushed back the early access launch for their human dollhouse rival Life By You to March 5th 2024. Rod Humble, the studio’s general manager and former Sims boss, said the game will be “a more robust experience out the gate” thanks to the six-month delay.

Double Dragon may be one of the original pillars of the beat ‘em up genre, but that foundation has weakened in modern times. Infrequent sequels of varying quality have tested Jimmy and Billy Lee’s modern relevance, but Double Dragon Gaiden does a solid job of reinventing the pair with a neat tag team mechanic. Though as enjoyable as this contemporary throwback can be, it often gets in its own way with frustrating combat design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. 
As was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
The Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.
To see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.]]></summary>

So much so that it seemed inevitable that a sequel developed in conjunction with Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games, and Headcannon would be next for the Blue Blur. Unfortunately, it never happened. We asked both Takashi Iizuka and Christian Whitehead what happened to Sonic Mania 2. 
Headcannon continued working with the Sonic brand through 2022's Sonic Origins and its 2023 update Sonic Origins Plus, while Whitehead founded his own studio, Evening Star, alongside fellow Sonic Mania developers in 2018. This past June, Evening Star announced its first game, titled Penny's Big Breakaway, coming in early 2024.

Intel's AVX10 announcement noted initial support with Granite Rapids processors that will debut next year but no mention of the E-core-only Sierra Forest. With the AVX10 only coming to P/E core client processors after Granite Rapids, it would appear the high density Sierra Forest generation will miss out on AVX10/AVX-512 and not appear until Clearwater Forest. Meanwhile with the 128-core AMD EPYC "Bergamo" processors now shipping, there is AVX-512 with the Zen 4C cores. Here are some benchmarks looking at the AVX-512 impact for Bergamo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, the story of Remnant II’s launch would start and end with it being an ambitious success of a shooty Soulslike. Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having "designed the game with upscaling in mind." 
Working the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.


“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.


“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”

In real life, I write to you today from a desk covered in a weird detritus of work and life that wouldn't quite see me on an exploitative reality TV show with the word hoarder somewhere in the title, but, you know... maybe give it 15 years.
But I bloody love tidying things in games. Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home. It makes the whole experience feel domestic and familiar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m guessing there’s an unwritten and unbreakable commandment that states every 2023 game must release next month. As evidence, the action RPG slasher Wayfinder is entering early access on August 15th. The game has some faint MMO flavours and comes from developers Airship Syndicate (the studio behind Darksiders: Genesis and Battle Chaser: Nightwar) and publisher Digital Extremes (responsible for the long-running Warframe.) The game previously held various closed playtests, but now the metaphorical doors are being opened for more players.

However, there's no need to be too downhearted, as your favourite indie-loving trio has every intention of continuing to collaborate on a few silly bits and bobs here and there.

I’m not sure I agree with the iconic murder clown. I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up? I know the showrunners are aiming for laughs, but what have they done to my game?
After watching the show’s first season, I must confess: I really like Twisted Metal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that Diablo 4's new season has arrived, I thought I'd give the game another shot. So, in an evening spare of stuff to do, I booted the game up and created a druid called ANIMALS. After a few hours of pressing 1,3,2,4, in either the same pattern or different patterns, I've come to realise the game doesn't make me feel anything. I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?
I know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all. I still stand by my stubbornness! But having obliterated more packs of rabid wolves and legions of demons, I've come to develop what I think is ARPG muscle memory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red have announced another batch of layoffs, this time affecting “around 100” employees, or roughly 9% of the company’s total headcount. The redundancies won’t take place immediately, according to CDPR, as some employees won’t lose their jobs until early next year at the latest.


“There’s no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed,” said CEO Adam Kiciński in an ‘organisational update’ posted to the company’s website. “We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and — based on current and expected project needs — we already know we don’t have other opportunities for them in the next year,” he continued. 


“To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the right teams,” says Kiciński. “What we mean by that is having teams that are built around our projects’ needs; teams that are more agile and more effective… After reshaping our development process and incorporating Agile methodologies, we’re now focusing on refining the shape of our teams.” Those projects in question include another Witcher trilogy, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and an all-new IP codenamed Project Hadar. That’s in addition to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 expansion called Phantom Liberty.

The original Remnant: From the Ashes was a surprise success thanks to its Souls-inspired action combined with third-person shooting and randomized environments. The sequel is a refinement with new environments and expanded lore. I enjoyed my time with the game and its final boss and the shooting mechanics feel great, but Remnant II ultimately doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the genres and games that inspired it.

If what you want is more flavour, tone, some player motivation, then three new animated shorts released today might help. Each tells a short 2-3 minute story of a different character in Starfield's galaxy, as they attempt to resolve their deep yearning with spaceships. To which we can all relate.

The court-ordered block was initially restricted to Germany but the music label complained that VPNs and a mobile network still allowed Germans to access the pirate site. Quad9, meanwhile, has appealed the underlying court judgment.

The announcement of Sonic Superstars sparked excitement among the fan base thanks to the return to the 2D style of gameplay found in the beloved retro entries in the franchise but complemented with gorgeous modern visuals. The game plays very much like an homage to those games that primarily lived on the Genesis, but developers Arzest and Sonic Team are adding various new elements to Sonic Superstars to expand on the classic gameplay fans are looking forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know how some games are notebook games? Well, The Banished Vault is a manual game, no two ways about it. Sure, you could theoretically make meticulous notes about all the planetary symbols and construction costs of the various buildings you'll need to harvest and convert resources into fuel, alloys and elixirs as you hurtle through space trying to escape the terrifying Gloom based on its in-game manual. But when there's a physical paper booklet that replicates all that for you in a much more easily accessible format, with several gorgeous illustrations of its mysterious space monastery to boot, not to mention infinitely better explanations of what everything does than I could ever hope to describe, it's quickly become an essential part of my play experience. 
I'm still working on my review for The Banished Vault (hopefully coming later this week), but as it launches on Steam today, I'd strongly recommend spending the extra £5/$5 to get one if you're at all interested in Lunar Division's space survival management 'em up. I don't think I could have survived in the game without it.

This track features the voice of Laura Bailey (Abby in The Last of Us Part II, Mary Jane in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2), who plays protagonist Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. Grace uses this power “to find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out.” You might also recognize Ashley Johnson (Ellie in The Last of Us) in the song. She voices Calliope, who joins Bailey’s Grace in “Adrift.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I sat down with GGRecon for a roundtable-ish interview with Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon director Masaru Yamamura and producer Yasunori Ogura to talk more about their upcoming mecha action game. And their answers gave us more of an insight into the game's early development, where the story might take you, and how you might overcome some of its trickiest nuts and bolts.
While it won't come as much of a surprise to Armored Core veterans, Armored Core 6 isn't an open world game. If you're a new FromSoftware-liker brought on board by the expansive world of Elden Ring, then yes, you might be a bit surprised. As I mention in my preview, Armored Core 6 sees you play a mecha-mercenary who selects jobs from a drop down menu and jets off to destroy whatever needs destroying. But Yamamura says FromSoft actually considered going down a more open world route in early stages of the game's development.

And rather like Red Bull's metallic fizz of aspartame and rocket fuel, I'd say the game shares a similar makeup. It doesn't give you wings, but what it does give you is a mech as nimble as a Eurasian Blue Tit darting at a confetti of stale bread.
As a historic mech-disliker, the game actually managed to instil a desire to become a skilled mech pilot. I want to buy new metal legs and attach gatling guns to my spine! But I'm apprehensive about the grind to get those parts and whether some of AC6's Souls influences clash with its rapid pace.

But being a director requires turning a switch in his brain. He's an introvert. But when he goes to work, he has to be an extrovert. He has to lead teams, micromanage, make tough decisions, and accept making mistakes – all skills he says he learned without clear guidance. 
To be able to do that, to make that switch, Johanas says you need to be a "weird psychopath." Though he likes to think he isn't a weird psychopath. "Maybe to some people I am," he says. "I don't know." Nevertheless, no one can be at that level all the time. And yet, here he is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. 
Sea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  
Sea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game.

The game is such a knowing snake ball of mating tropes that it ouroboroses round into being brilliant, flawless, ridiculous. And also Alan is a terrible writer, I would hate his books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One eagle-eyed Starfield fan has apparently spent around 200 hours stitching together what could be the game’s entire skill tree using previously released footage of Bethesda's epic space RPG. I’m not actually sure whether you can be a “Starfield fan” before the game releases, but this budding detective is at least a fan of the trailers, featurettes, and the Starfield Direct. Come and see what they've come up with.

It's an almost experimental little town management game where you have no control over building placement, your citizens all look like they were made in Picrew, and love is a plentiful yet almost useless resource. I quite like it, but I wish I liked it more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.

Despite the wordplay in the title, the game is unexpectedly dark and violent, which is surprising considering the team's last game is about a cat on a Metroid-inspired mission. In any case, we like what we've played so far. Gunbrella is coming to PC and Switch some time this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. 
Despite the "VI" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or "Raven" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. 


Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC. You can learn more by checking out our recent cover story.]]></summary>

More specifically, Skull Island: Rise of Kong will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime this fall, according to publisher GameMill Entertainment. The game is being developed by IguanaBee and is a third-person action-adventure game set on Kong’s home turf, Skull Island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.
The five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.


The video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. 
Atlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

“We wanted to create a title that brought FPS fans and Gundam fans together," Maruyama writes. "We challenged ourselves to create an authentic Gundam FPS game that could be played globally. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is no longer possible for us to provide a service that satisfies our players.”
A livestream detailing the sunsetting roadmap will air tomorrow, July 21 at 11 p.m. PT. Gundam Evolution’s services officially end on November 29. Until then, Maruyama states that it will still receive updates. Season 6 arrives on August 23, and the final season hits on October 25. Both seasons will introduce a new unit and maps. 
Today, the following services will be suspended:
Ending sales of EVO Coins
Ending sales of EC Pod Limited
Ending updates to EC Pods, CAP Pods, and Ticket Pods
Gundam Evolution was announced at a PlayStation State of Play in March 2022. The FPS title lets players suit up as their favorite mobile suits to battle in 6v6 matches across various game modes. Unfortunately, it now joins the growing list of multiplayer titles that closed their doors this year, which includes Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Babylon's Fall, Rumbleverse, Apex Legends Mobile, and Knockout City.]]></summary>

Mortal Kombat creator and director of MK1, Ed Boon, tweeted yesterday what fans can expect at the SDCC panel, “Resetting Mortal Kombat: A New Beginning With Mortal Kombat 1,” tomorrow, and it’s going to be perhaps the most significant drop of new information we’ve received for the game yet. Boon says MK1 voice actors will be there alongside NetherRealm Studios developers to tell the “making of” story of the game. Plus, there will be three new MK1 trailers during the panel, including gameplay and a “surprise.” 
Mortal Kombat fans at San Diego Comic-Con. Wanna see a TON of new #MortalKombat1 stuffs?

As for when, the “Resetting Mortal Kombat” SDCC panel begins tomorrow, July  21, at 3:15 p.m. PT and lasts one full hour, ending at 4:15 p.m. PT. If you’re ready for new Mortal Kombat 1 footage, be sure to tune in!
MK1 was announced two months ago with a teaser trailer indicating the wider Mortal Kombat universe has been completely reset (hence the “1” in the title). The following month, in June, NetherRealm released our first look at MK1 gameplay with a trailer that featured new looks at the roster, story details, the reveal of Kameo fighters, and more. 
During Summer Game Fest, we went hands-on with it that same month and had a blast with the Kameo fighters and gory and fun fighting action. You can check out some of that action in our MK1 New Gameplay Today here. 
The latest news NetherRealm released about MK1 was a trailer earlier this month revealing Smoke and Rain in the game’s fighter roster. And tomorrow, we’ll receive more information, including three trailers. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.
Are you tuning in tomorrow to learn more about Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This news arrives the same day Activision Blizzard released its Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 results, which highlights a murky future for the company’s esports efforts despite an otherwise financially successful quarter for the Overwatch 2 maker. Activision Blizzard’s results show that net bookings grew 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, from $1.64 billion to $2.46 billion, due to a lucrative Diablo IV launch, an increase in revenue from various franchises, mobile growth, and more. But, despite that growth, the company laid off around 50 employees in Blizzard’s esports department, Activision Blizzard esports senior director of global communication Brad Crawford confirmed to Game Informer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>
