On the official PlayStation Blog, Aaron Jason Espinoza, Senior Community Manager at Insomniac Games, stated: "While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, we’re delighted to bring all of our previously released post-launch content to the PC version", further squelching all the fan's hopes of a potential DLC that would expand the game's storyline.


This is quite unfortunate, seeing as how the game left many open plot points that seemed to be teasing a DLC campaign, with the "The Flame" side quest being one of the most pr…]]></summary>

You know the drill.


At the same time, there is quite a world of difference between so-called "smut" and romance novels that feature compelling characters and compelling narratives. Sure, they're not what you'd call high art, but the writers at least put in a bit of effort to make the guilty pleasure of reading them a little more palatable. To that end, here we 1…]]></summary>

Instead of following Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf in order, each game takes place in a different era, with different incarnations of the characters. This has created one of the greatest mysteries in gaming — the official Zelda timeline.


Since the games only drop hints at where in the timeline they take place, historically, it’s been up to fans to figure out where they go. However, Nintendo has released an official timeline for the Tears of the Kingdom Master Works. But where does the latest addition, Echoes of Wisdom fit? That’s what we’re here to speculate.

But if you want to enjoy different endings, there are two Sparking episodes to explore - Parental Bond and Number One Spot. Both alternate storylines require you to play the main saga and complete some additional objectives. Let's first take a look at how you can access Parental Bond.


How to unlock Vegeta's Parental Bond episode in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


In the Wind-Up Doll quest, you'll fight against Android 18. To unlock Parental Bond, you'll have to defeat Android 18 as quickly as possible. For such quests, I keep a timer of three minutes as a boundary. Additionally, you can't fully defeat Android 18, so you will have to simply reduce her health.


Once you've defeated Android 18, you'll face Trunks in the next episode. You'll unlock an extra path towards the main path if you fail against Trunks.

In the Wicked Heart episodes, you'll come across Babidi. If you want to not succumb to his Brainwashing, a hidden objective has to be completed. To do so, you'll have to defeat Trunks in the Preparing for the World Tournament episode. You can't change the default difficulty setting and must not take too many hits from Trunks.


If you manage to complete the hidden objective successfully, you'll get the chance to withstand Babidi's Brainwashing and unlock the Number One Spot Sparking episode inside the game. The Number One Spot is an interesting storyline, but I like Parental Bond more. Unlike characters like Goku and Future Trunks, Vegeta doesn't have a third Sparking episode to unlock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throne and Liberty is an MMORPG game developed by NCSoft. In this game, there are several chapters that you have to complete to progress. In Chapter Eight, you will encounter a Snake Tower quest, which might be a bit confusing to complete. To help you complete it, here is a comprehensive guide to the Snake Tower quest in Chapter Eight of Throne and Liberty.


How to complete the Snake Tower quest in Throne and Liberty


First objective

Completing this quest is very simple, as first, you have to open the map and teleport to the Moonlight Desert Waypoint. Make sure it is not raining since you can’t see the purple plants if it's raining. If you want to know the timings of the rain, here is the guide for it. 


Once you go there, you can see some purple plants on the ground. Now, stand on these purple plants and let the Tentacle Desert Flower hit you with the poison. Once you are poisoned for a single time, the purple plant will convert into a Fully Bloomed Crimosa. Collect four of these Fully Bloomed Crimosa to complete the first objective of the Snake Tower quest in Chapter Eight of Throne and Liberty.


Second objective


Now, onto the next objective. Here, you have to go to the Moonlight Oasis and talk to the Creation Crafter Grudran. He will give you the censer, which intensifies the fragrance and helps to spread the smoke. Once the conversation is over, the Snake Tower quest will be completed.


Upon completion, you will get 21,571 Soliant, three Rare Polish Crystals and three Rare Base Material Selection Chests.

The first generation of Pokémon games features some of the most iconic locations in the entire franchise. The eerie Lavender Town, the winding Viridian Forest, and the quaint Pallet Town where all players start their journey.
Pallet Town isn’t just a fanciful creation, but draws real-life inspiration from Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri’s hometown of Machida within the Tokyo Metropolis. While the Machida of today and of Tajiri’s childhood are very different, there are yet many elements within the city that evoke the adventurous feeling of Ash Ketchum's hometown.

        <updated>2024-10-19T09:21:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Invincible Sun is one of seven new Deviations added to Once Human's latest scenario, The Way of Winter. It's a great fit for Burn builds, so you might wonder where to get the Invincible Sun. It's not all that difficult — let's explore. 


Where does the Invincible Sun Deviation drop in Once Human?


You can find the Invincible Sun by clearing Securement Silo Delta, which can be found in the Onyx Tundra at coordinates (5171,4191). It's only a level ten dungeon, but you'll be able to get a level one Invincible Sun upon completing it for the first time. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The dungeon itself is quite easy to complete, and the only potential hiccup is the last room, where you're asked to investigate the source of the anomaly. All you need to do here is stand on the stage and wait a few moments. 


You'll be teleported to the boss arena, where you can quickly melt him down, even with Tier I weapons and armor. 


Is Securement Silo Delta still bugged? 


You may have heard that Silo Delta was bugged and that people couldn't get past the wall of fire. Thankfully, the developers have taken speedy action and fixed that bit in the Silo, so you can now use the switch beside the firewall to turn it off. 


This means it's now possible to complete Delta and claim your Invincible Sun. However, if you are running Burn, you might want to wait until the Hard dungeons open up before you switch away from your Pyro Dyno. It's easier to get higher-level Deviations in Hard and Pro Mode. 


You can still get a level five from Normal Mode, but it's exceedingly rare.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Invincible Sun works kind of like the Polar Jelly, and you can throw it at enemies to inflict Blast Dmg and it also has the chance to inflict Burn on enemies, dealing Status Dmg over time.

The weekend is here, which means it's time to kick back and enjoy some quality time with games. Before we find out what we're diving into, however, let's take a look back at some of this week's biggest stories.
First up, it looks like the GameCube controller might be making some sort of comeback, which is pretty wild. We also heard word from Nintendo that NSO is promising to bring "excitement" in 2025, so let's all look forward to that. And of course, we gave our final verdict on the bizarre, but rather delightful Alarmo clock.

A true horror creator's only fear is to have their creation ridiculed. No one wants to pour their soul into making what they think is the scariest monster of all time and then have audiences laugh their asses off at it.

What makes it meaningful is its atmosphere. It takes place in a small chunk of a futuristic city. A commercial center of bars and shops and narrow corridors and walkways. You can't talk to anyone or interact with anything; you just wander aimlessly. You might discover a raucous bar, then wander lonely, empty corridors looking for whatever else might be happening.

Fancy learning Latin? Well, you’re guaranteed to learn at least one word in the classical language by playing Faith: The Unholy Trinity: Mortis, or “death”, which flashes on screen every time you succumb. Facing off against legions of the damned armed with only a wooden crucifix and, well, your faith, it’s a given you’ll be succumbing quite a bit.
Dying a lot comes with the price of admission for developer Airdorf Games’ 8-bit horror odyssey, one that truly puts the 'cult' in cult status, which it has enjoyed since releasing on Steam and itch.io between 2017 and 2022. Now on the Nintendo Switch, fans of retro horror are in for a wholly unique entry in the genre that looks, sounds, and feels like nothing else.

Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets.

It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

It's called Cronos: The New Dawn and it's about - bear with me here - going to the past, harvesting souls, then going to the future so they can help you. It's all because you are, um, wanting to find a special rift in the future, so you can go back to a special version of the past. I think. Anyway yeah, it looks kinda fine to good.

Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts.

For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halloween is here and while you may enjoy this holiday, you might not be as into scary horror games as others. You aren’t alone! Horror games can be incredibly intense, even for those who love a good scary movie. But maybe you still want to enjoy some games on Halloween, just without all the jump scares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake developers Remedy have announced their very first multiplayer game, a three-person co-op shooter set in the world of Control and thereby, the Remedy Connected Universe. Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

Similar SMT on/off tests for "Turin Dense" with the EPYC 9965 192-core / 384-thread will also be coming in a future benchmarking comparison on Phoronix. These tests are mainly intended for reference purposes for those curious about the SMT benefits at such high core counts and what workloads may or may not still benefit from SMT especially when having so many threads while using 12-channel DDR5-6000 memory.]]></summary>

Developer Powersnake took to the Future Games Show Spring Showcase earlier this year to reveal Voidwrought, an upcoming horror metroidvania that seems to have more than a little Hollow Knight peppered in its DNA.
This one launches on the Switch eShop on 24th October, throwing us into a creepy underground world packed with crafty combat and perilous platforming — ring any bells? The art style and movement mechanics instantly put us in mind of Team Cherry's masterpiece, but this doesn't seem to be any old hollow imitation (god knows we've seen some of them), with an underlying shrine-building objective appearing much more optimistic than the dark and down-trodden world of Hallownest.

Nightdive Studios’ quest to revive some of gaming’s most bizarre and long-forgotten treasures shows no signs of slowing down. With the release of PO’ed: Definitive Edition earlier this year, it was a clear-cut signal that the team is ready and willing to embrace titles that may not be the most recognisable in an increasingly crowded market, but nevertheless represent and preserve them, unearthing titles that would otherwise have fallen ever further into obscurity.
Killing Time: Resurrected, originally developed by Studio 3DO and released in 1995, is another example of Nightdive’s valiant endeavour to spruce up curios, and from a technical point of view at least, it’s one of the studio’s most impressive efforts yet. Its presentation has been greatly enhanced while still retaining everything that made this 3DO FPS so unique, resulting in a product that frankly makes the original release borderline obsolete.

The developer has released a handful of updates in the time since, trying to improve the game as it stands and today, we've landed another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bohemia Interactive have announced that Arma 4, the next big instalment in their shooter simulation series, will release in 2027. The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

After getting delayed to 2025 way back in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universal Orlando has today announced that its Epic Universe (which includes Super Nintendo World) will open its doors to the public on 22nd May 2025.
The above reveal trailer only contains a small snippet of the Nintendo attraction (with Mario and the gang having to share the limelight with The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic, How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk, Dark Universe and Celestial Park), but we're excited nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

After targeting a residential address and four business addresses in the West Midlands, police say a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of copyright and money laundering offenses. Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. That's the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve never learnt to drive, and while I’ve always told myself it’s impractical - unnecessary, expensive, potentially dangerous for someone with undiagnosed but, I suspect, incredibly likely dyspraxia - I’m not sure it’ll ever stop being one of those quiet regrets; the ambient type that don’t really bubble to the surface much unless I’m watching a Noah Gervais road trip video, but just float there and make my mood like, 1.5% worse at all times.
So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)]]></summary>

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

This is why I like the demo for first-person shooter Cop Bastard a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest Steam Next Fest - out right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last October, Paradox Interactive announced that they and development studio Harebrained Schemes were breaking up, following underwhelming sales of Harebrained's 1930s-set XCOMlike, The Lamplighters League. The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

You are the lone engineer on a rustbucket submarine exploring the dangerous waters of a submerged country in an alternate reality 1990s. The warning lights on the control panel are flashing, a buzzer is spluttering like a dying bluebottle, and your robotic assistant is about as useful as an umbrella in the Mariana Trench. Things could not get any worse. And then you see it. Something in the green haze outside. Something with a tail.

Or at least, a proper list of known bugs on day one, to preempt any compilations created by vengeful players? Skyrim Lead Designer and Starfield Systems Designer Bruce Nesmith has spoken a little about the “interesting problem” of how open developers should be about technical issues on day one, given the expectation some players have that every game should be "flawless".
When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My earliest memory of the Commandos series of tactical stealth games was my dad bringing home a box copy of the original. “The missions take months. Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

I react to this news with mingled happiness and disappointment. Disappointment at the delay, and happiness, because I hadn't heard of Beyond These Stars before. To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long?

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week.

It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few games demonstrate the disconnect between graphics and aesthetic like Metaphor: ReFantazio. A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

Stablemate Europa Universalis 4 has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while Cities Skylines is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades.

They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

I could write a laborious metaphor about someone coming looking for me in a saloon using whatever that literary technique that Irvine Welsh does is called where you spell out the accents, but I won’t bother. I simply do not have another tarnation in me. Perhaps a root. Don’t even talk to me about a toot. Here’s the specs, as per the Steam page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August, New Zealand's Justice Minister authorized Kim Dotcom's immediate arrest and extradition. Dotcom's response to his followers on X was simple: "I'm not leaving." Another post mid-September - "we are very close to disaster" - led to Dotcom disappearing for three weeks. On his return, Dotcom said X had suspended his account, based on an extremely serious allegation. After accusing Elon Musk of failing to help, yesterday Dotcom warned that a Trump loss would see Musk indicted and "fighting for his life." Dotcom has a plan to avoid extradition; chaos like this provides the fuel.

Which is harsh, because they can provide heaps of capacity at relatively attainable prices, as the Crucial BX500 is currently demonstrating. Per Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon UK is running the 2TB version for just £92 (34% off) as well as 4TB for £178 (41% off). Meanwhile, Amazon US is lopping 43% off the 1GB model, bringing it down to $54, with the 4TB model shedding 13% to reach $210.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".
