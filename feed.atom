Nevertheless, now and again, one arrives with so much personality and adventurous gameplay that it's nigh impossible to not fall in love with it. Penny's Big Breakaway is one of those titles, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with a demo for it.

Penny’s Big Breakaway is filled with content and refined mechanics, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise; the game is the product of Evening Star, a studio which features several developers from Sonic Mania, including Christian Whitehead.

Children of the Sun takes that formula and turns it on its head, and if were just any ole shooter, it wouldn't have held my attention long. However, it manages to be so much more with its puzzle game wrapping paper, ensuring I can't get enough just from my earliest of first impressions.


It's violent and clever without ever taking itself too seriously. If you're searching for a traditional FPS, this may not be the title to scratch the itch. For those of us seeking new experiences, whatever form they take, it's potentially 2024's most creat…]]></summary>

I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been paying attention to the world of graphics cards lately, you'll know that Nvidia released SUPER variants of its RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti (link missing) GPU. Now, Team Green finishes its trilogy with the launch of the RTX 4080 SUPER, which was released yesterday.


Much like the aforementioned products, the new 4080 dials up the juice a bit when compared to its predecessor. For starters, it has 10,240 CUDA cores, while the previous model has 9,728. It also boosts the clock speed, memory clock, and bandwidth.




Not everything's changed, though. It still retains the 16GB of GDDR6X memory that the non-SUPER RTX 4080 has. Also, the TGP is still at 320W and the memory bus remains the same at 256-bit.


The big change seems to be the price


As noted by Videocardz, Nvidia's latest Ada Lovelace card appears to have had a price adjustment when compared to the cost of the 4080 on launch.


It's still $999, which pushes it more towards the enthusiast area of pricing, but given that its predecessor was priced at nearly $1200 in September of 2022, it feels like a good drop.


Of course, a grand is still a grand, and you can still pay upwards of RTX 4080 SUPER for $1,200 for it depending on where you shop. But at any rate, a lot of the PC hardware world is going to be watching what AMD will do next. Three new Nvidia cards in a month is quite the act to follow, even if they're not new-new, as such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a lot of other horror fans, I'm holding out that Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 won't be a major letdown. While we wait to find that out, however, we can treat ourselves to the new "combat trailer" shown at the most recent State of Play.


There are no prizes for guessing what the footage shows. While we get some of the cinematic goodness of the new Silent Hill 2, we also get to see James Sunderland and his guns making friends with enemies. Ha ha! Their heads ago a-splatter!




But in all seriousness, it seems the remake is doing a revamp of the combat to make it more modern. It makes sense. The original SH2 – as magnificent as it was – wouldn't work in this era with its rather outdated control scheme.


New Silent Hill when?


Of course, the question on everyone's lips is: when's it coming out? Well, we don't know that I'm afraid. The trailer doesn't give a release date or even a release window. We can "wishlist now" and it's being made exclusively for PS5.


On a personal note, I'm slightly bitter that it's only coming to PlayStation. Sure, I could get it for PC, but there's no way on this – or any other – planet my laptop would be able to run it (my laptop says hi, by the way).


From what we've seen, it looks like Bloober's take on what is considered a masterpiece has potential. Unless the studio deviates massively from everything that made the original so iconic, it's going to take a lot to really fumble an up-to-date reimagining of this horror classic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scratch that glitch.
A game as massive as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was always going to have a couple of bugs just waiting to be found by the glitch hunters out there. Since its launch, we have seen players discover ways of getting infinite items, fire immunity, even one-hit weapons, but none have felt quite as personal as this — skipping the game's introductory area.
Let's not forget, Breath of the Wild's Great Plateau was such a sticking point for the glitching community back in the day, with the possibility of skipping it becoming the holy grail of all discoveries. The answer is still yet to be found, so it's natural that certain players would take to the TOTK equivalent, The Great Sky Islands, with the same level of skippable optimism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great 3D platformer seems to be a rare and special thing these days. I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.
So where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.

It's Lightyear Frontier, the upcoming farming/crafting mech adventure game from Frame Break and Amplifier Studios, and happily, we now know when it's finally coming out. Lightyear Frontier will be launching into early access on both Steam and Game Pass on March 19th, and you can go and play a demo of it right now, too. The demo is technically part of Steam Next Fest next week, but it's live now for all to enjoy (just like every other Steam Next Fest demo, it seems).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been patiently anticipating Chicken Police: Into the Hive since its announcement last June. I loved 2020’s Chicken Police: Paint it RED, and was hopeful for a continuation. I got an early look at the demo, and it’s a pretty bland taste, but it’s not necessarily indicative of a problem.


I think it’s difficult to build a demo of any narrative-centric game. Usually, these sorts of titles have a slow build with character introductions, and they may not begin any meaty twisting until later in the game. Trying to fit both the context and the hook into a demo without giving away too much of the overall runtime can be difficult, and Chicken Police: Into the Hive isn’t the most impressive attempt.


It doesn’t do anything to sully my excitement for the full story, but it doesn’t really heigh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, it feels like a lot of us are fit to burst on all things Palworld. However, as Pocketpair sends out another patch to fix a variety of bugs, the game continues to experience more popularity than...well, a very very popular thing.


Version 0.1.4.0 has been rolling out on Steam, with a lot of fixes being implemented. For starters, there's been an issue where players have been receiving damage twice. This has now been patched out. Also, players will "no longer pass through walls when dismounting." That was a thing, it seems.




Going forward, expect a lot more Palworld updates. The developer says it's going to continue development, "placing top priority on fixing major problems and issues." Given the current state of the game, fans would probably expect nothing less than bug fixes. Oh, also the update for the Xbox version is expected soon.


Not enough people in Ecuador to play


Along with the recent patch, Pocketpair also gave the good word on Twitter/X that the game has experienced more than 19 million players. That's 12 million on PC and seven million on Xbox. That's about as much as...a very very large thing (I'm not good at analogies today, it seems).


A few days ago, Palworld smashed through the two million concurrent player mark, according to SteamDB. It's become one of – if not the – fastest-selling game in recent memory. Two weeks. It came out just two weeks ago.


We're still waiting to hear what Nintendo/The Pokémon Company will turn up in its investigation. For now, Palworld continues to be as huge as...you know what...you can take it from here.

Straight off the production line are fixes to crashes, as well as enemy pals getting stuck in walls. And if you've been plagued by other players stealing your flock, then worry no longer, as pal spheres chucked at your low-HP pals won't capture them anymore. Breeding also becomes easier, with the removal of some annoying flourishes. There's a lot more and it gets progressively sillier.

Poor Switch Lite. Although Nintendo's smaller, budget-friendly handheld certainly has its audience, there's no doubt in our mind that it pales in comparison to the Switch - OLED Model thanks to the latter's far superior screen.
This could well be a thing of the past, though, as YouTuber and handheld specialist Taki Udon has created a prototype mod that replaces the standard LCD screen in the Switch Lite with an OLED screen. What's more, Udon has stated that the mod shouldn't cost too much to implement, with prices ranging from $25-$50 based on overall interest.

Set in 19th century Japan's Bakumatsu era, the game is a mixture of open-ended exploration, sneaking and agile traversal that puts me heavily in mind of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Unlike most Assassin's Creeds, however, this one has a pretty in-depth, rigorous melee combat system, with bosses that look like they're going to grind my gears no end. Will it be as vicious as Nioh 2? I'd better start stocking up on comfort food.

        <updated>2024-02-01T00:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.
Sonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.
In July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. "Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," Iizuka says. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time."
By adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.
Sonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here.

It’s launching on April 26th for PS5 – there’s no PC release date just yet, and I do hope developer Shift Up make the effort, because some rather cheesecakey female character models notwithstanding, this looks pretty decent.

It's out in 2025 on PS5, with a PC release date still to be revealed, and appears to be as free-wheeling and self-serious yet whimsical as you'd expect from a Kojima joint. I got as far as the pet anime dragon before my brain squirmed out through my ear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's State of Play, we got more insight into what we can expect from Rise of the Ronin which is one of PlayStation's next big games. 


Traversal is extremely dynamic and in addition to running, you can also glide and ride your trusty hose. Of course, you aren't there to enjoy the countryside, so a lot of time was given to illustrating the combat which features blades and even a flamethrower. 




Taking place during the final years of the 19th century, the game depicts the Boshin War. you'll be able to create your own character and engage in combat with various weapons. Though the premise is intriguing, RotR will have to work hard to not be just another Assassin's Creed set in Japan. 


The game launches on March 22 on PS5.

While we don't know what exactly we'll get a look at, today's State of Play did say Square Enix will be sharing new gameplay details along with exciting news we "won't want to miss".


Demo, please?


The Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth State of Play will go live on February 6.  FF7: Rebirth then releases a few weeks later on February 29. How can I speed up time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.
The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. 


Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.
If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 


Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 
He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something comforting in not only Death Stranding getting a sequel, but its trailers not getting any less strange. In fact, today's State of Play trailer was maybe the most bizarre look yet, spotlighting an entire new region for Sam to connect, and a release window of 2025.


Now apparently dubbed Death Stranding 2 On The Beach, I'm not sure where to start with all this. Sam "Porter" Bridges, portrayed again by Norman Reedus, is back in the lead. Fragile is back too, with a hand-based neck apparatus that can act as both a mask and as just, uh, hands.




Sam and pals are back on a new journey to save humanity from extinction amidst the Death Stranding, where enemies are still around every corner. We see packages being delivered, people floating in the air, and plenty of familiar iconography. But there are plenty of twists and turns.


Higgs looks to be back, as a Joker-fied version of himself, shredding a guitar while fighting a robot samurai with a baby voice. Still processing that one. There's also a puppet companion, almost like a Jiminy Cricket-style character? Who can do vampire eyes? It's wild.


Honestly, bring it on. I'd always rather have something weird and outside my expectations run headfirst into walls than something that feels too safe. And while Death Stranding 2 certainly seems like it's iterating on the original, there's plenty of new and weird here to keep me interested.


Death Stranding 2 is planned for 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's PlayStation State of Play, developer Vertigo Games and publisher Deep Silver revealed the next entry in the post-apocalyptic Metro series is headed to VR. Metro Awakening serves as a prequel to the original Metro games that has been built from the ground up for VR as a story-driven first-person adventure.





"This origins story is so essential to me," said Dmitry Glukhovsky, who is also serving as a lore consultant for Metro Awakening. "It feels like returning to the foundations and roots of the series - now at the level that VR technology can bring."
- Dmitry Glukhovsy, Author and Creator of Metro and Lore Consultant on Metro Awakening



Survivors of Nuclear Armageddon cling to life in buried subways of the Moscow Metro where ghosts and spirits haunt the living. Players will quite literally—via VR—step into the role of Serdar, a doctor and rationalist. Players have to brave the darkness, crippling radiation, and deadly threats of Metro in search of Serdar's wife and the medication she desperately needs.


I'm still not 100% sold on VR but Metro is a pretty creepily immersive series, so I think this could turn out to be a good experience if done right. It's promising that rather than doing some sort of port, Vertigo Games is developing Metro Awakening with the features of the PlayStation 5 and PS VR2 in mind from the start.


Metro Awakening is set to release on PS VR2, Meta Quest 2 and 3, and PC VR in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Team Ninja have released a new trailer for Rise of the Ronin, and it features plenty of bloody gameplay and new details about the Bakumatsu period in Japan. There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. 
In combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. 
Rise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out. You can read more about that in Game Informer's Rise of the Ronin preview here. 
Check out all the new gameplay in the latest Rise of the Ronin trailer below: 


Rise of the Ronin hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

We heard murmurs that the remaster was going to be revealed less than a week ago. This news comes not long after the announcement that the game is being adapted into a movie, which doesn’t seem that much of a departure from the game itself. The trailer shows off some familiar and reworked scenes with a new lick of polish. 


I’m going to be real with you; I didn’t play Until Dawn, so I don’t really know what I’m looking at. Still, cool for fans. Probably.


The remaster of Until Dawn will release for PS5 and PC sometime in 2024.

As we highlighted in the game’s review, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.


Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.]]></summary>

What's really impressive is some of the visuals they're putting together for Judas at Ghost Story Games. The section where the hand gets assembled in real-time? Creepy, in a good way.


It's hard to get too much of a feel for the gameplay here, outside general first-person shooting and some freaky powers. But all the style—glitter excess smashed against everything falling to pieces—certainly seems in place.


We'll have to wait and see on more, because we still don't have much of an idea on a release date. Judas is currently in development for PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has revealed that a remake of Until Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. Notably, this PC release means more people will get to experience developer Supermassive Games' breakout narrative-driven horror. However, it's unclear if Supermassive is developing this or if a different team is handling it. 
PlayStation revealed this new version of Until Dawn, which it says has been "rebuilt" for PS5, during today's State of Play in a new cinematic trailer that highlights the improved fidelity. This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game. 
Check out the Until Dawn remake trailer for yourself below: 


For more, read Game Informer's review of Until Dawn, and then check out our thoughts on its PlayStation VR spin-off, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. Supermassive released a spiritual successor to Until Dawn in 2022 called The Quarry – read Game Informer's review here – but its next game is Little Nightmares III, which is due out sometime this year.

The trailer doesn't offer a ton in the ways of storytelling set up, instead serving as a flashy highlight reel of what's likely the game's strongest suit: action. Whether you're slaying beasts with swords and axes or blasting them with magic, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks as thrilling as fans would expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After enjoying great success on PC, Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation in April. This news comes from the latest State of Play, though we don't get an exact date just yet.


What we do get is a sneak peek at a possible collaboration with Godzilla which should spice things up in May. 




Though Dave The Diver has been acknowledged as an indie title in several awards ceremonies, this has also drawn controversy because the developer is owned by the billion-dollar corporation Nexon. 


How you view the game is ultimately up to your beliefs of what qualifies as an indie title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's PlayStation State of Play delivered a new Death Stranding 2 trailer and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is weird as hell. The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, "These days I am Fragile in name only," before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.


The trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.

Other interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.
The trailer ended with the phrase, "Should we have connected?" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Sony's most recent State of Play, Konami unveiled a brand new Silent Hill project. Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.
Check out the trailer below to see it for yourself. Though as a quick heads-up, there are brief scenes of self-harm.


The Short Message trailer looks conspicuously like the alleged leaked images for a new Silent Hill game we saw back in February 2022 that Konami DMCA'd. As Polygon detailed at the time, the leaker "Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow." This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.
Despite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall. It appears the future of Silent Hill is as bright as it is foggy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami announced as part of the Playstation State of Play Stream that a new entry of the Silent Hill series, Silent Hill: The Short Message, not only exists but also is available now for free.




Silent Hill: The Short Message has you play as Anita, a woman who finds herself in a desolate apartment block after following messages from her friend, Maya. The trailer appears to demonstrate themes of bullying and suicide, which sounds pretty Silent Hill to me.


The trailer shows everything from a first-person perspective and omits combat, which makes it seem like a walking sim. It might be worth a look anyway, as Konami has released the game for free, so you’re only playing with your time.


Silent Hill: The Short Message is available now exclusively on on PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is a getting a new action title this spring. We got a long look at Stellar Blade, the upcoming action RPG from SHIFT UP Corporation, and a release date of April 26, 2024.


We got a pretty long look at what's in store for this PlayStation title at today's Sony State of Play. As we had seen before, Stellar Blade has a lot of sci-fi and action in store. Following the protagonist's fight to reclaim Earth from a malevolent force, it certainly looks like it's got some spectacle in store.




Really, Stellar Blade seems to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, at least to me. There's a lot of NieR: Automata here, and maybe some light Xenoblade and other sci-fi too. But I like the blend. It's got some identity of its own too, with some gorgeous graphics and an almost Scarlet Nexus-style brand of cyberpunk around it.


I could certainly go for sci-fi action, and this looks like it could be a bit of a surprise in April. Stellar Blade is due out on April 26, 2024 for PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2011, as the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 20 years old, Sega and Sonic Team decided to celebrate with Sonic Generations, a game that remade various iconic and fan-favorite zones from Sonic's past in both 3D and modern 2D versions. The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.


As the name implies, Sonic x Shadow Generations remasters the well-liked title for modern consoles but adds various enhancements. While 60 frames-per-second performance is already attainable by playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox Series X console, Sonic x Shadow Generations brings much more to the table. In addition to remastering the Sonic levels, this version adds Shadow as a playable character alongside new levels for him.
Sonic x Shadow Generations will be available this fall for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen little of Stellar Blade since its reveal way back in 2021, but during today's State of Play event, we got a new deep dive into the upcoming action game. Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. 
Players will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. 
Check out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: 


In Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. 
Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you want to build a PC? Not ready to give up your older Ryzen motherboard but still want great gaming performance? Previously your only option was the (superb) 5800X3D, which uses a 3D V-Cache to massively boost gaming performance, but now the cheaper 5700X3D is also available. 
Made from silicon that wasn't quite good enough to turn into the 5800X3D, these processors boost slightly lower but come with the same complement of extra L3 cache, making them still head and shoulders above models like the 5600X, 5800X, 5900X and even 5950X - not to mention older Ryzen 1000, 2000 and 3000 models.
Following its launch this month, the brand new Ryzen 7 5700X3D is now available from B&H Photo and Amazon in the US for $249 or Amazon UK for £233, a great price that undercuts the $308 5800X3D significantly. Here's some links:

The first game from the franchise launched almost a decade ago exclusively in Japan as a mobile and browser-based JRPG. Over 35 million people played this iteration of the game, but it never really made it to the West other than an English patch.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is somewhat of a reimagination of the original game, but as a full-fledged action RPG. Instead of waiting out timers or saving up for gacha pulls, you'll progress through a series of missions unlocking new quests and characters along the way. More importantly, you'll engage in real-time action RPG as opposed to tapping buttons when it's your turn to attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiss kiss, it's February  — or close enough, at least. That means Final Fantasy XIV is wrapping up January's festivities and moving on to the next big thing with its 2024 Valentine-themed celebrations, Valentione's Day. More importantly, did you see the new emote?


Starting on February 7, 2024, at 12 am PST (until February 21), you can begin the FFXIV Valentione's Day seasonal event and add the Love Heart emote to your collection. Dote, my once go-to emote for greeting friends, is now out. Love Heart is in. It probably doesn't need to be a competition, but it's too cute to miss or ignore.



There's also a chair, I guess. (Image via Square Enix)



The Symbol of Love quest begins with Astrid in Old Gridania (X:10.2, Y:9.4), and awaits locked behind the usual Level 15 requirement. My guess, barring any wild unforeseen surprises deviating from a decade of FFXIV events, is that Astrid's quest lands you the Love Heart emote, while the nearby House Valentione maid sells the Valentione's Heart Chair.


Can't tell you what I'll do with the chair yet, but I'll certainly buy dozens and forget them on a retainer  —  just in case I have need for a room of heart chairs. It's not the first gaudy, love-dovey furniture I've turned my nose up at, but all is forgiven for the emote that makes my miqo'te look as cute as a K-pop star.


For now, that's all we know of this year's Valentione celebrations, but you can watch the Lodestone explainer for updates. Until then, check out our handy FFXIV seasonal event calendar, and get your glamour goodies from The Maiden's Rhapsody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We last got a look at the latest project from Onion Games, Stray Children, back in September during the Japanese Nintendo Direct. At the time it was set for winter 2024 in Japan, but those plans have changed and the RPG has now been moved to a general 2024 release window (via Gematsu). 


The official Onion Games Twitter account shared the news about the delay. They said the entire staff is working on Stray Children every day, and they would appreciate it if everyone could give them a little more time.




With the future of Stray Children in mind, the official website is also hosting a survey. It includes questions and answers in both English and Japanese, and asks everything from basic demographics to Switch game format preference, language options, merchandise, additional platforms, and crowdfunding. They also want to know your favorite RPG and which Onion Games you've played before, so if you're a fan who's looking forward to Stray Children you might want to take a moment to fire off some responses.


Onion Games has a handful of very interesting games to its name, including Million Onion Hotel, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and Black Bird. Stray Children is a new RPG from the studio that has some of the Moon staff on board, so there's a lot of promise there already. Here's the previous trailer for those who missed it:




Hopefully we'll find out a more concrete release date soon, but if it means a stronger showing, we don't mind the wait at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears that developer Tokyo RPG Factory will be merging into Square Enix. According to Gematsu, as part of an absorption-type merger, Square Enix will inherit all assets and liabilities of Tokyo RPG Factory and the subsidiary will be dissolved and cease to exist. The company was established back in June 2015 as a Square Enix subsidiary to develop I am Setsuna and would go on to also develop Lost Sphear and Oninaki.




JRPG Developer since 2015


Tokyo RPG Factory released all three of its titles in a roughly three-year span between 2016-2019. That means it's been almost five years since we've heard or seen anything from Tokyo RPG Factory, which is a big difference compared to its nearly annual releases.


All three releases were highly anticipated for their classic JRPG style, but never quite hit the level of success the company surely was hoping for. I am Setuna currently has a 7.4/10 on Metacritic while Lost Sphear and Oninaki are both just under 7/10 at 6.8 and 6.9 respectively. Destructoid's Chris "The Legend" Carter gave Oninaki a 6.5/10 back in 2019 stating "Maybe Tokyo RPG Factory should look at changing their formula and scaling down to tighter 10 hour adventures."


Unfortunately, it looks like we might not get to see that possibility.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

If we had to pick the gaming hot topic for January 2024, it would be 'not-Pokémon'. Palworld seems to be the lookalike on everybody's lips, but that doesn't mean that it is the only game saying "Ditto" to the Pokémon formula out there. And, boy, does Nintendo know it.
Yes, as flagged by Games Radar, Nintendo of America has filed an opposition to the attempt to trademark the term 'PokeZoo'. This 'new' IP was set to be a trading card game which boasts, according to its website description, "groundbreaking mechanics that break the 4th Wall". Mhmm.

The limited-time mode (LTM) dropped alongside Season 2's Iron Crown Collection Event. The rules are self-explanatory: drop into a Battle Royale match all by your lonesome, with 60 legends total competing for bragging rights as well as some cool character- or win-specific badges.
In some ways, playing alone was a great way to test one's might in duels without relying on teammate assistance. However, the experimental LTM was a double-edged sword, revealing that some ability kits were simply stronger than others in 1v1s. For instance, Lifeline's "D.O.C. Heal Drone" made her a near-unkillable force, but her "Combat Revive" passive was rendered useless since there were no allies to resurrect. You can already see some…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then, you just need a fresh look. Whether it's kicks, some additions to your wardrobe, or a slick-looking new controller design. I'm talking a little more fashion-forward; fewer shades of black and white or gamer green.


Folks looking for the latter, Xbox is adding a little more variety to your collection. A new line of Xbox Vapor controllers is rolling out. The best part is that you can choose the one that Microsoft has already cooked up. Or, you can concoct one for yourself in the Xbox Design Lab. 




Xbox started the vapor look with the Stormcloud Vapor Wireless Controller that debuted in August. It must have been pretty popular, as we're getting an entire line of custom controller options based on the vapor look. 


The Xbox team did create a new iteration of the Vapor series that will retail separately from the Xbox Design Lab choices. Dubbed the Dream Vapor Special Edition controller, it sports a cool-looking pink and purple tone that, of course, features all the swirlies. The controller is listed for $69.99 on the Xbox Store and will be released on February 6.


Xbox Series X|S Dream Vapor controller


As for your options in the Xbox Design Lab, Microsoft revealed that there will be six top-case options to choose from. Styles include Electric Vapor, Noctural Vapor, Fire Vapor, and Cyber Vapor. As well as the OG Stormcloud Vapor and new Dream Vapor styles that you can customize more to your liking. 


Like most Series X|S official controllers, the Vapor series comes with up to 40 hours of battery life, Bluetooth and Xbox Wireless connectivity, a hybrid D-Pad, textured bumper, trigger, and side cap grips, as well as diamond-patterned grips for a comfortable feel on the back. 


Choosing a Vapor series look within the Xbox Design Lab adds a $9.99 upcharge to your custom Xbox Series X|S controller. You can begin workshopping ideas as of today.

The trailer shows 14 minutes of our vamp creeping about a warehouse with a pretty Dishonored-y combination of stealth and magical violence, showing very much why the sequel is now described as an "action RPG" rather than just "RPG".

Blackburn announced on Twitter that he's passing the reigns onto a new leader next month. And while this change might seem abrupt to some, Blackburn notes that development on The Final Shape expansion is nearly done and is now entering a playtest and bug fix phase to prep for release.


Previously working as a Design Lead for Raids and then for the whole game, Blackburn had a hand in some of the most beloved Destiny 2 content. Most notably, he was a Design Lead when players got the stellar Forsaken expansion and its Last Wish Raid. Blackburn briefly left Bungie in 2019 to pursu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you’ve been living under a rock, the monster-catching survival game Palworld is the hottest thing since sliced bread. As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.
An app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. 
[Warning]
January 31, 2024
Pocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. 
Palworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year. You can also watch us play Palworld from the beginning in this episode of Game Informer Live.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["At the initial idea stage, we collected over 1,000 ideas".

While the Super Mario series can get quite weird with its lore, world design, and general concepts, nothing comes close to the sheer absurdity of the WarioWare franchise. How many games out there let you pick someone's nose, perform dental work, and have a back-scratching competition with Mario? While on paper these activities may sound like the last things you'd want to spend your coveted game time on, they're executed masterfully and delightful to play.
For decades, we've been puzzled as to how the folks over at Intelligent Systems and Nintendo come up with the microgames that make up the WarioWare series. Where do these ideas come from? How many are left on the drawing board? Where does one even begin to develop so many different micro projects? To get some answers, we recently had the chance to chat with Goro Abe, who was not only the Chief Director on the latest game WarioWare: Move It!, but has been with the series almost exclusively as a programmer, designer, and director since the very beginning.

In a statement received by different media outlets like IGN and Inverse, 2K spoke on the matter, saying:


"Spec Ops: The Line will no longer be available on online storefronts, as several partnership licenses related to the game are expiring. Players who have purchased the game can still download and play the game uninterrupted. 2K would like to thank our community of players who have supported the game, and we look forward to bringing you more offerings from our label throughout this year and beyond."

Alas, I have no review to lay at your feet, because the game booted once as soon as I got it, then didn't work for about five days, and for the rest of this week has booted at a ratio of about 1:8 of successful boot to attempts to boot. It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build. I can't speak to what your odds will be if you get it, but sure, if it works, you'll have a fun enough time, probably?

The thrill of adventure in a boundless playground tickles the imagination, something intimately familiar to players of Granblue Fantasy, a mobile/browser-based title that has been a hit internationally for over a decade. The original title resembles 16-bit turn-based RPGs like the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of old, leaving daydreams of grander scale and exploits a hopeful wish rather than an inevitable reality. With Granblue Fantasy: Relink, developer CyGames has an opportunity to explore a fantasy world of open skies and magic while…]]></summary>

With that said, I'm not blind to some of the flaws of the company, including the often missing features at launch such as chapter selection. It's not compulsory by any means, but when you consider the lack of photo mode as well, you begin to wish things were a little more filled out. 


Slowly but surely, the Finnish developer has been working on the game, even after the dramatic Final Draft which gave many the narrative closure they were searching for. This time around, the latest update has added a chapter select feature. As the name suggests, this'll let you replay any of the past chapters you've completed already which, for many, means multiple replays of Chapter 4.

Anticipation for the system has sent shares of the company to a record high in recent weeks, although industry analysts for Goldman Sachs, CLSA Securities, and Macquarie Group have suggested that Nintendo will have its work cut out to exceed the level of interest and unit sales that the current console has enjoyed since 2017. Switch has sold over 132 million units as of November 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League released into early access for owners of the Deluxe preorder edition earlier this week, granting armchair supervillains prepared to shell out £100 or $100 a headstart on players buying the regular edition, which launches this Friday 2nd February. Or at least, that was the idea.
Like many an online-required live service game before, Suicide Squad's premium access release has been marred by technical bugs and glitches, the most severe of which saw players logging in to discover the main storyline already completed. I guess Rocksteady were serious about not wanting people to treat it like a "life commitment".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The greatest compliment I can give to Palworld is that it lights up my brain in the same way a modern Assassin's Creed game does. It taps into the same checklist clearing compulsion that saw me spend over 100 hours in both Odyssey's Ancient Greek archipelago and the Viking open world of Valhalla - only instead of chasing map icons that take you down weird sidequest rabbit holes that riff on Fenton the (sheep)dog, or gobbling up story events just so you can make googly eyes at every warm-blooded human in a ten mile radius, Palworld hooks you in with its enormous catalogue of base building tasks. Not catching the 100+ Pal monsters roaming around its mysterious islands, but crafting the perfect sweatshop to put them to work in. It's one of those, "I'll just add this furnace so I can craft some ingots that will let me make a cooking pot to level up my base, but wait, now I need some ore to make those ingots, and oh god, I've just spent seven hours doing not very much at all, have I?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster collection for Final Fantasies 1 through 6 back in 2021, I was overjoyed. For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.

Among the wildlife you'll murder are giant spiders, which might be a dealbreaker for some people, so it's just as well Nightingale comes with an arachnophobia mode which transforms those spiders into... large, winged balloons with teeth. It also replaces decorative, non-interactive, smaller spiders and scorpions found in the game's environments with ant models. If you have a phobia for ants or menacing balloons, you're out of luck, I guess.

Nintendo is widely known for its wholesome, family-friendly content, but it often likes to push certain boundaries when it comes to its WarioWare franchise, injecting a bit of crude (but still rather tame) humour into its marketing material to reflect Wario's more 'off-colour' personality.
To demonstrate this, Nintendo has launched a new WarioWare website dedicated to the franchise, and it's chock full of the kind of wacky humour you'd come to expect at this point. Designed to represent the WarioWare, Inc. company, it showcases information on the main man himself, his employees, and the franchise's history. If that's not enough, there's also a dedicated fart button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It worked on three RPG games for Switch.
There's some industry news coming out of Japan today that Square Enix has absorbed the developer Tokyo RPG Factory.
As part of this, Tokyo RPG Factory will be immediately dissolved and "will cease to exist as an individual entity" (thanks, Gematsu). Tokyo RPG Factory was a subsidiary of Square Enix and was founded by Yosuke Matsuda a decade ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, you heard that right. Godzilla has been unleashed on the world of Minecraft. Mojang and Microsoft released the Godzilla-themed DLC by Japanese studio Team-KYO on the Minecraft Marketplace today. According to the Minecraft blog, players will start in movie theater screening rooms before picking one of four adventures from the iconic Godzilla films.




Godzilla!


Look, I know Minecraft gets a ton of DLC. And honestly, I'm usually not too interested in it. But come on, it's Godzilla! Obviously, the King of Monsters himself is featured in the DLC, but based on the trailer, other monsters will be making an appearance including Gigan, King Kong, and King Ghidorah. Maybe we'll even see Mechagodzilla, right?


It looks like each of the four adventures in the DLC has its own gameplay modes. The blog told us about two. In the first, players have to flee from Godzilla in an escape mission. In the second, players are tasked with speed building to create walls and obstructions in an attempt to contain Godzilla and save the city. All four adventures can be played in multiplayer and have unique rewards for completing and exploring them.


The Minecraft Godzilla DLC is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace for 1510 Minecoins. The closest amount to that you can purchase is 1720 Minecoins for $9.99.

While previewing what to expect from Phase 2, Blizzard included a small paragraph simply titled "No More GDKP Runs". According to the post, Blizzard will be experimenting with a new policy for Phase 2 that will no longer allow GDKP runs specifically in Season of Discovery.




Wait, what is GDKP anyway?


To understand GDKP, we first need to discuss DKP. Grab some popcorn as I try to make this long story short. Back during the launch of Everquest in 1999, players became frustrated with how loot was distributed when defeating the toughest encounters in the game: dragons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision and the Call of Duty team dropped a sneak peek of an upcoming collaboration for COD:MW3 and Warzone Season 2. In a recreation of the signature The Walking Dead opening title scene, the teaser shows scenes from around COD's Verdansk map while playing The Walking Dead theme music. The collab will drop alongside Season 2 on February 7 and feature Rick and Michonne, assumingly as new Operators.




Quite the lineup


The Call of Duty Operator lineup is getting pretty insane, right? Rick and Michonne are joining the ranks of Homelander, Kevin Durant, TimTheTatman, Snoop Dogg, Lara Croft, Spawn, 21 Savage, Skeletor, and even Lilith from Diablo 4. Oh, there's more, that just seemed like some of the crazier ones. When I first heard about these additions I thought it was insane. I mean let's be real it's still weird getting teamkilled by Nicki Minaj and then watching her go on to shoot pink tracer rounds on Terminal.


However, Rick and Michonne will probably fit in a bit more, at least in Call of Duty: MW3's new Warzone-like Zombie mode. Rick better have a "CAAAAAARRRLLLL!" voice line or I am going to be disappointed.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone both enter Season 2 on February 7 on all platforms.

While a North American copy of China Warrior would run me $40 or so (with case and manual), I got the Japanese version, The Kung Fu, alongside Genpei Tōma Den and Susanoo Densetsu for roughly the same price because nobody wants The Kung Fu. Okay, that’s not actually true, it probably has more to do with the fact that it was one of the first titles released for the PC-Engine and, therefore, most likely had a massive print run, so supply greatly outweighs demand.


The North American price mostly relates to the fact that the Turbografx 16, the North Ame…]]></summary>

Not so, it turns out, because Blizzard have just announced they've added them today, and with working multiplayer for both.

Sunsoft shared a new trailer via the IGN YouTube channel, highlighting more of the follow-up's fantastic looking stop-motion felt style. It's got a bit of a Kirby's Epic Yarn vibe to it, and the animation really sells the diorama aesthetic. 




Ufouria: The Saga was originally released for Famicom in 1991 as the first entry in Sunsoft's Hebereke series. A European release followed in 1992, but folks in North America didn't get a chance to try it out until it hit the Wii Virtual Console in 2010. If that port and its re-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends, like all live-service titles, is no stranger to balancing updates. Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.

As mentioned in the X post above, the Alliance Requisition Bundle includes armor sets based on Garrus, Liara, and the protagonist, Commander Shepard. In addition to the bundle, which players will presumably have to purchase, three items will be available for free – the Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow.
Destiny 2 is currently gearing up for its next expansion, The Final Shape, which is set to launch later this year on June 4. It's supposed to usher in the conclusion of Destiny's story so far, so now's a good time to get caught up if you aren't already. Here's what we thought of their most recent expansions, The Witch Queen and Lightfall.  If you start in two weeks, you can do it while roleplaying as Garrus!

The upcoming "Kafkaesque" immersive sim gives you the simple goal of escaping a town within a few days, a task which is somewhat complicated by the fact that a Leviathan-sized Russian cop towers over the city, watching you. In a new dev blog, developers TallBoys explain more of how you might court the giant's approval (the term "fully fleshed dating-sim mechanic" features) or avoid it by sneaking about while he sleeps. You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.

They're codenaming it Hornet. The announcement trailer is sort of Lethal Company meets STALKER with a bodycam found footage perspective. It's quite the cocktail of tropes, though I'll take this over another "Soulslike roguelite deckbuilder" or similar.

Back in the Xbox 360 era, my friends and I held the X button one time and miraculously found a game in Gears Of War, having waited for ages. We grew superstitious. Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like "I bet we WON'T find a match", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed. It is all-seeing and all, sadly, science.

Even though Mario is now known as the most iconic face in gaming, in his first appearance, 1981's Donkey Kong, he couldn't even get his name in the title. That was corrected in 2004 with the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a side-scrolling puzzle game designed to carry on the legacy of the classic arcade cabinet. Twenty years later, that outing has been reimagined for the Nintendo Switch, and Mario's rivalry with Donkey Kong – as well as the gameplay – holds up surprisingly well.
After the local toy store runs out of Mario toys, Donkey Kong goes on a rampage at the toy factory, leaving with a sack full of toys and Mario in hot pursuit. As Mario, you'll go through a series of levels w…]]></summary>

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.


So goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive.

Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Roya…]]></summary>

Made in just "a week(ish)", Celeste 64: Fragments Of The Mountain channels the spirits of Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie as it tasks players with collecting dozens of strawberrys hidden around its snowy 3D landscape. It's well worth checking out if you've got a spare minute or so, though given how rock hard it is you may want to put aside a good hour or so if you want to truly master its controls and uncover every last secret.

Alongside this cancelation, Eidos-Montréal, which is the studio behind 2021's Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, has revealed it is laying off 97 employees. 
Bloomberg reports that Eidos-Montréal had been working on this new unannounced Deus Ex game for two years, and it was set to enter production later this year, according to sources familiar with the studio. It seems the studio's canceled game and subsequent layoffs are another casualty of Embracer, which has been purging studios after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is Paldean Fates, which brings new Shinies into the mix, plus various type-shifted Tera Pokémon and new special-illustration cards. Unfortunately, you can't buy these booster packs individually; instead, you must purchase special collections like the Elite Trainer Box or the Tech Sticker Collection. 
Despite this unconventional release method, Paldean Fates adds an absolutely massive number of cards to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldean Fates is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld isn't just about capturing non-copyright-infringing Poke-fied wildlife, slaughtering the poor creatures and/or setting them to work in terrible gun factories. There's also the frightful question of Pal breeding. Every Pal in the game can be bred with every other Pal to produce a Pal subspecies with a chance of inheriting traits from its parents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Tekken 8, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the impending release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, 2024 is off to an explosive start, but the rest of the year is still up in the air. Luckily for PlayStation fans, Sony is pulling the curtain back on some games coming soon to its platforms this Wednesday, January 31, at 2 P.M. Pacific/5 P.M. Eastern. Check out the X announcement below.
Get ready for a new State of Play! https://t.co/KDyuY2Uvfq

Tune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from… pic.twitter.com/MQg76iv8Tt
January 29, 2024
The showcase will specifically show off extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Rōnin. The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.
As for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.
What are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.
As a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make. And you know what? I'm good, actually. The Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster is good enough for me in this lifetime.

That'll keep you trucking when daylight dips below six hours in Norway, though you might need to wait a few years for it.

This includes Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, Majin Vegeta, and more. 
Bandai Namco first revealed Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero at The Game Awards 2023 back in December, which is where it was confirmed that, despite the different name, this fighting game is the next Budokai Tenkaichi game in the storied series.

Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.
Which is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger. Yet all of it was moving of its own accord, as if I'd somehow stumbled into a child's dream.

This entry in the series is from far from the first Prince of Persia game, but it represented a reboot of sorts and has become the game most identified with the franchise. It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.
Join superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic. This isn't the first time we've revisited Ubisoft's classic platformer. You can watch our original Replay episode on Sands of Time from 2015 here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played certain demos for longer than I have many full games, eking every last atom of enjoyment out of a single level or character, to the point that the final release felt like unnecessary bloat. I am already concerned the same might be true of Arco's demo, which is now available on Steam. You've hopefully read Katharine's breakdown of this "triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape". Well, now's your chance to get to grips with its nifty combat system, which is broken into turns with each turn's actions unfolding in real time.

Honestly, did no one remember that February's Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit's time this year? I'm all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner.

You have to supervise them constantly, not relax and watch them grow organically while eating a sandwich and only occasionally intervening like a neglectful goddess.
Writer's Rush is sort of, sort of an idle game, I'd argue. It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either. Because, I think, of its charmingly, intentionally daft representation of what being a novelist is like.

A lot of people seem delighted to rocket around in the colourful adventures of pizzeria proprietor Peppino Spaghetti. People who are younger than me. People whose hands aren't gnarled claws. People who don't have one foot in the grave. It'll happen to you too. In the meantime, I hope you've enjoyed it, and suspect you might be keen to see more of the new playable character coming free in a future update.

This report follows yesterday's news that Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax divisions. Alongside this news, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra also announced he was departing from the company, and we learned the aforementioned survival game had been canceled. 
However, Blizzard didn't really touch on why the game it had just announced exactly two years prior was canceled. Bloomberg's new report details development struggles around the game's engine, which was prototyped using Epic Games' Unreal Engine before "Blizzard executives decided to switch…]]></summary>

I was innocently carving myself a nice stone foundation last night when the Devil jogged my elbow and I dug a massive, raggedy trench straight through it. I've spent an hour now trying to fill in the trench and flatten it out, to no avail. There's always a jaggedy bit right in the middle, and I'm getting displaced trypophobia from the awareness that my efforts have seeded the terrain beneath with random cavities.
What's worse, there is no mention of enhancing the floor-levelling functionality in this Keen Games forum post on Enshrouded's various launch issues, which they are even now racing to fix. Instead, it's all talk of frame rates, multiplayer stability and dedicated servers not appearing. Somebody rush me a cement mixer, stat, or I'm moving back to Valheim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t exactly spawned from the most hardware-bothering of game series. Most previous LADs, be they Kiryu’s Adventures in Punching or the more turn-based reboot have all been technically gentle affairs, and Infinite Wealth is ultimately another one. At the same time, it shares with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name a newfound interest in PC-specific tricks. That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.
Let’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC. We’ll also work out its best settings, to keep it running smoother than a legally distinct Segway.

I'm excited, therefore, that Adventure mode is coming soon to the Steam version of the game, and excited even more so that it's aiming to make it even more accessible.

A new update on development which outlines exactly how the new premium version of Adventure mode differs from the original, including its plan for tutorials to guide new players.

Cut to several hours later and I've had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro's demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you're into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too.

Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience.

Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, "if not all," of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Naughty Dog announced Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II would be coming to its recent release, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, in a post-launch update for the game. Now, we know exactly when this behind-the-scenes documentary will be live: February 2. 
Grounded II will be added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered in a free update for the game on February 2, but you can also watch the documentary on YouTube the same day. The documentary and associated game update will both go live at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
If you haven't yet, check out the Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II trailer below: 


As you can see, Grounded II promises to dive into various behind-the-scenes aspects of Naughty Dog's latest and arguably most controversial game. The trailer touches on studio crunch, leaks, and more. 
While waiting for Grounded II to go live next week, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II, and then check out these first-time player impressions of The Last of Us Part II Remastered. After that, read my opinion piece about how HBO's adaptation can fix the worst part of The Last of Us Part II, and then watch these two NGTs for The Last of Us Part II Remastered: Surviving the No Return Roguelite Mode and Checking Out The "Lost Levels" Cut Content.

A little swirl in olive oil and balsamic? Mwah, delicious. For a more regular transaction, I do love a multi-seeded loaf for the added texture. Now, would I say I like bread more than… anime? That's tough. But thankfully I don't need to decide, as there's a demo of a game out right now that combines both interests. In Aeruta you play as an anime girl who defeats monsters and uses their innards to fuel her bakery business. Perfect.

In an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Phil Spencer is very sad to reveal to the staff that, in order to grow, the combined powers of Microsoft's 22k-strong Gaming Division have to be denuded to the tune of 1,900 human beings. That amounts to about 8% of the division.

Super Algebrawl started life as a experiment by one of the devs to help teach his daughter maths, though frankly I think it'll teach her maths is cruel.

Well, clearly the trio of developers at Phoenix Blasters did, as their upcoming platformer Telmari puts them front and centre as its main form of traversal. Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem. I've been playing its Steam demo this morning, and while it's a little rough around the edges, there's definitely something here for those trained in the Super Meat Boy school of pixel perfect platforming.

Hivemind, which also worked on Netflix's The Witcher, was developing the series with Sony Pictures Television, but co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani revealed on Twitter that the project is dead when asked about it, as reported by PC Gamer. 
"Dead," Shamdasani writes on Twitter in response to someone asking what happened with the series' production. "We took around a fantastic pilot script by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton along with a multi-season plan they built with our showrunners, but got rejected across the board. The size and scale needed to do it right proved too much for anyone to want to risk. Amazon came closest."

The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. 


Initiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People Can Fly, the developer behind 2021's surprise shooter hit Outriders, has laid off more than 30 employees. This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that its source with knowledge of the situation said the job cuts affected only staff working on an unannounced game at the studio, codenamed Project Gemini, that is to be published by Square Enix. 
Kotaku reached out to People Can Fly after its source sent screenshots confirming that layoffs happened at the studio, and development director Adam Alker confirmed the news. Alker cited budget limitations and a shrinking scope for Project Gemini as for why it was laying off "over 30 people." The publication notes that another 20 outside of the 30 laid off were removed from the project and moved to other projects at People Can Fly.

His post reminded me of Pope's other hit, Return Of The Obra Dinn. The closest we've come to a "Dinn-like" is probably 2022's outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. 
Happily, the "Golden Idol-like" appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life. And I couldn't be more here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
