        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical real-time strategy threequel Age Of Empires III: Definitive Edition will see the arrival of a ‘casual-friendly’ mode that shifts the focus from combat to economic success in its latest DLC pack, Knights Of The Mediterranean. Developers Tantalus Media and Forgotten Empires have revealed that the DLC will also feature new Italian and Maltese civilisations, an allegiance-shifting diplomacy mode and a variation on random maps based on historic European wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as you can get before the game crashes.
Promoted as a nomadic city-builder with roguelite elements, As Far As The Eye promises to scratch a lot of itches. It caught our attention as an intriguing spin on hex-based Civilization-style strategy when it released on Switch two weeks ago, so we had to check out what looked to be a soothing indie darling with mobile origins. Unfortunately, despite a handful of unique ideas, a wealth of technical issues has buried this otherwise competent strategy game – buried it so thoroughly we cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone in its launch state.
First impressions are good, mind; As Far As Your Eye immediately captivates with its aesthetic. The hexagonal grid for each journey comes in pastel oranges, greens, and blues, while the little characters called Pupils elicit jovial feelings with the adorable animal forms they morph into when assigned a specific job. Gentle music accompanies these calming visuals, enough that a half an hour with the game could help put you to bed after a stressful day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

It was only a month ago that body-horror game Oxide Room 104 was confirmed for Switch and a bunch of other platforms, and now it has a firm release date. It'll give us sleepless nights when it lands on the eShop on 17th June, with a physical edition to come later in the Summer.
The hook with this one, beyond plenty of gore and some horrific monsters, is that each death brings another run starting in the same bathtub; each time you play conditions and events will be a little different.

        <updated>2022-05-13T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game is back with its second expansion of 2022, and this time, despite the Sword & Shield nomenclature on the box, I was most excited for the Pokémon that appeared in games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don't worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII's main region.
However, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:

Releasing a football schedule might sound boring on paper, and perhaps if you’re not the Chargers it is, but the Los Angeles-based team decided to do something we think every NFL team should do: release its football schedule as an anime opening, complete with a great track and some well-done animation that harkens back to anime favorites like One Piece, Attack On Titan, and much more. Check it out for yourself below!
Should we REALLY make our schedule release video an anime?

May 13, 2022
As you can see, the video begins with a nice logo treatment before revealing that the Chargers will face the Las Vegas Raiders in both teams’ first game of the 2022 season. And if you’re at all familiar with One Piece, you can see how the Chargers turned the Raiders into the One Piece team. 

The rest of the video contains a bunch of other great anime references so be sure to check it out and let us know which one is your favorite below! After that, read Game Informer’s Madden NFL 22 review.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-13T12:30:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve played Elden Ring, then you’re familiar with the strange occurrence that happens when you reach the main menu of the game and you’re somehow forced to sit on the screen for at least 30 seconds while listening to what can only be described as an extremely hype start to the day’s Elden Ring session (or is that just me?). 
It’s a great song – orchestral, epic, and an awesome way to begin the game each time you boot it up. However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. 


As you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!
For more Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10 and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes From Software’s next game should prioritize co-op. Check out this story about how someone used a modded Fisher-Price baby controller to play Elden Ring on PC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though it might take a while.
Nintendo's founding Yamauchi Family still seemingly has a great deal of fondness for the video game company. In a significant move, it has acquired around 3000 square metres of land in Kyoto, specifically surrounding Nintendo's original headquarters in the city's Shimogyo Ward. The headquarters itself has already been transformed into the Marufukuro hotel; you can take a look at some images of the hotel itself in our previous article.
The Yamauchi Family is looking to redevelop the acquired land around the hotel, with plans said to include restaurants, art galleries, and more. It's not known at this time whether the redevelopment will include nods to Nintendo itself, but it's likely the family will need express permission from the company to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Class-action also alleges false statements and false advertising.
In August last year WATA generated plenty of headlines, as criticism started to mount over the boom of retro game prices amid allegations of wrongdoing from the game grading firm. Claims surfaced alleging that the company was artificially driving high prices, along with claims of collusion with auction house Heritage Auctions; this extensive video by Karl Jobst also did a great deal to bring the allegations to a wide audience.
It's now emerged that a class-action lawsuit was initiated this week in the Central District of California (thanks, VGC). The lawsuit accuses WATA of "engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market, engaging in unfair business practices, engaging in false advertising, making false statements about the turnaround times for grading services and failing to disclose material delays to customers."

We've never really been fans of the idea of buying an expensive ticket for a concert only to spend the 2 hours or so it's likely to last holding some sort of recording device up in the air, watching the whole thing through the lens of a screen. Call us old fogeys, but to us, concerts are one of few experiences in life where you can truly live in the moment, forget about everything on the outside, and just get lost in the music.
Having said that... If we were to record a concert, you can bet we'll be taking a leaf out of a few Nintendo fans' books and using our 3DS consoles to do so. We know what you're thinking: the quality would be awful, right? Well, yeah. But that hasn't stopped others from doing the same. As reported by IGN, a trend has been emerging in recent months whereby some concert goers are using their 3DS consoles camera to record footage of the live gigs.

Nintendo of America was last month named alongside hiring firm Aston Carter in a workers' rights complaint, when an individual worker claimed their legally protected right to unionise was violated. Nintendo issued a response to this, stating how the worker was "a contractor previously terminated for disclosure of confidential information" and this followed with more allegations about the working conditions for part-time and contract workers at Nintendo.
Now, in an update, Axios Gaming author Stephen Totilo has shared part of an internal message sent out by Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser to employees about "stories appearing in some media" regarding the "alleged working conditions at Nintendo". Bowser said he and the executive leadership team found many of the points "troubling" and were "reviewing the content". He reiterated how Nintendo had a "zero-tolerance for inappropriate conduct, including harassment, discrimination or intimidation".

Just last year, we got New Pokémon Snap, a sequel to one of Pokémon's most beloved spin-offs more than two decades after the fact. Now, 2022 brings us Mario Strikers: Battle League. Announced in February during this year's first Nintendo Direct, Mario Strikers: Battle League is the first entry in Nintendo's arcade-style soccer series since 2007's Mario Strikers Charged on Wii. While Nintendo gave us some tidbits of information on what to expect through Battle League's initial reveal, Nintendo really pulled back the curtain today through a new overview trailer, which you can see below.

In Evil Dead: The Game, don’t expect to find the human heroes cowering in corners or attempting to flee – this 4v1 fear festival takes the fight directly to the forces of evil, hacking enemies in half and blowing them to pieces.
In 1981, Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead made a grisly splash onto the horror scene, featuring what’s become an almost formulaic setup: Five unfortunate friends head out to a cabin in the woods for a good time, and then, spoiler alert, good times are not had.

        <updated>2022-05-12T21:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighting game bringing together the WB brands under one brawl-for-all, has finally had its first official look at gameplay with a Pros vs. Devs exhibition. In the 18-minute video, two professional fighting game players, NAKAT and VoiD, square off against developers from Player First Games, director Tony Huynh and principal developer Daniel Kraft, in a 2v2 competition.
Feast your eyes on the video above to see what actual matches of MultiVersus look like in the format the game was built around: two-on-two team battles. KATAT and VoiD are top competitors in MultiVersus' very early testing, coming in the top spot of a closed alpha team tournament, so the action on-hand is fast-pasted. Only four characters are shown in the video – Tom and Jerry, Superman, Shaggy, and Wonder Woman – but there's plenty to learn about how each character plays if you look closely. We also get a look at the U.I. used in fights, with the numbers representing damage taken on each player always showing directly below that character's model. It took me a little bit to get used to the change over the classic Smash Bros. U.I., but I get how this can be more readable at a glance.
Along with this first look at MultiVersus gameplay, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games have announced a 32-team tournament that's set to take place at Evo in August. The prize pool for the event is set at $100,000, laying down the challenge for potentially big payouts for those who place high in the competition. 
MultiVersus has had a few smaller closed alpha tests but will be moving into another testing phase starting on May 19. If you're interested in a chance to throw hands with the iconic slate of Warner Bros. characters, you can sign up for a chance to play in the 9-day event on the game's website. MultiVersus does not have a release date yet but targets PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as a free-to-play product with cross-play and cross-progression.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As outlined in yesterday's extensive article about NVIDIA's new open-source Linux kernel GPU driver, currently for consumer GeForce RTX GPUs the driver is considered of "alpha quality" while NVIDIA's initial focus has been on data center GPU support. In any event with having lots of Turing/Ampere GPUs around, I've been trying out this new open-source Linux kernel driver on the consumer GPUs. In particular, I've been curious about the performance of using this open-source kernel driver relative to the default, existing closed-source kernel driver. Here are some early benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's presumably less pressure to keep every scrap of information secret when the game you're developing is a remake. EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake's audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game's art, they've announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Bethesda announced that it was delaying both Arkane Austin’s Redfall and Bethesda Game Studios’ highly-anticipated Starfield. As for why, Bethesda kept it simple: both teams need more time to make the games the best they can be. And while my initial reaction was sadness – like many, I was very excited to check out both this year – I feel a bit of relief.
No, I’m not going to mention that Shigeru Miyamoto quote here, as I’m sure you’ve heard it plenty of times (it’s true, though!), but I will say that this delay means a lot for Bethesda. In fact, I think Bethesda’s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success. 


Let’s head back to 2011. Bethesda Game Studios released Skyrim, easily its most popular game and arguably its best RPG, on November 11, 2011. It got a 9.5 out of 10 from us…]]></summary>

Netflix has unveiled two teaser trailers for its upcoming Resident Evil series, due to release on July 14th. You check out the trailers themselves in our original post, but in the meantime, there's an awful lot to unpack here, so we thought we'd share some of the most intriguing images from the two trailers and see what's going in New Raccoon City.
Trailer #1
The first trailer kicks off by giving us a glimpse at the main characters in the show: Billie and Jade Wesker. They're moving to 'New Raccoon City' which, by the looks of it, appears to be an entire city manufactured by Umbrella Corporation.

There’s no denying that Naoki Yoshida is a massively popular and important figure to the Final Fantasy franchise. When the series hit a low point, Yoshida helped turn its tide, most notably helping transform Final Fantasy XIV after its disastrous launch into one of the most successful and revered MMORPGs of this generation. Nearly a decade later, he’s still finding ways to keep fans engaged with the content and returning for top-tier expansions like Endwalker. This consistency hasn’t gone unnoticed.

There remains much work to be done, though, to promote industry-wide understanding and communicate the vital importance of implementing these options for many gamers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive and EA have revealed that the upcoming Dead Space Remake will be released at the start of next year.
More specifically, the from-the-ground-up remake of the 2008 sci-fi survival horror classic will be released on January 27, 2023. Some of the Motive team revealed this in a new livestream that aired today. Back in March, the team showcased some new gameplay in a livestream focused on the remake’s audio development and today’s stream was all about the visuals of Dead Space. Right at the end of this stream, the team shared the official January release date alongside new gameplay. 
You can check out the gameplay segment in the livestream below at the 1:18:23 mark: 


Here are some screenshots we captured from the stream if you can't yet watch the video: 

According to Motive, this gameplay is technically pre-alpha but the team said the game’s visual and environmental team worked hard to elevate this to a state they’d consider greater than pre-alpha. In fact, Motive said this is closer to the level of quality that the studio says players should expect for the entire game. 
“[It’s] not ready to ship, but it’s getting closer,” one of them remarked during the segment before another revealed the team recently completed its first full walkthrough of the remake. 
As for when we’ll see Dead Space again, Motive said it anticipates doing a gameplay-focused reveal or livestream in October, closer to Halloween. That’s perfect timing because it’s just a few months before its January 27, 2023 release date. While waiting for this gameplay reveal, be sure to check out the gameplay look shown back in March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A decent yield.
The March arrival of Rune Factory 5 on Switch in North America and Europe was very welcome, following its initial release in Japan back in May 2021. The excellent Rune Factory 4 Special also graced the Switch in early 2020, so the RPG / farm-sin series has been quite well served on Nintendo's hybrid.
The IP's fans seems to have shown up in decent numbers for the latest release, too, with XSEED Games confirming that Rune Factory 5 has sold over 500,000 copies globally on Switch. We know that in Japan alone it'll have sold more than 130,000 copies, so in under two months in the 'West' it's picked up a decent number of sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has released an Alan Wake Anniversary video in honor of 12 years of Alan Wake, and in it, the studio showcases some new Alan Wake 2 concept art and more. 
More specifically, Remedy’s new update includes four new pieces of Alan Wake 2 concept art and news that Alan Wake Remastered is coming to Switch this fall. There's also an update on the Alan Wake TV show first announced in 2018 (we can’t believe it’s still happening, either). As far as the new concept art goes, it’s exactly what you’d expect: moody, dark, and subtle in terms of what it reveals about Alan Wake 2. The art looks great, though! You can check it out in the slideshow below:
Moving on to what the team has to say about Alan Wake 2, here’s what Remedy's creative director Sam Lake shared:
You can check out the development update for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in the video, Remedy reveals that Alan Wake Remastered, which hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC last year, is coming to Switch this fall. It will be a digital-only release on Switch, and it runs natively on the console – it’s not a cloud version like Remedy’s Control is on the platform. 
Remedy also revealed that its Alan Wake TV adaptation, which was announced four years ago, is still a real thing and very much happening. In fact, the studio has found a home for the series: AMC. You likely know of AMC as the home of The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, and now, AMC Networks has purchased the rights to this Alan Wake adaptation. Remedy says there’s still a lot to go for the series to become a reality, though, so don’t expect to watch an episode of it anytime soon. 
While waiting to learn more about Remedy’s Alan Wake series, read Game Informer’s Alan Wake Remastered review and then check out the reveal of Alan Wake 2.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land continues to sell well, clawing back into second spot with 77,330 units sold. Elsewhere, it seems to be business as usual for the heavily Switch-centric charts, with just one PS4 game making its way into the line-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While 2022 started strong with a string of spectacular releases, the warmer months have begun to cool, with most AAA experiences waiting until fall or 2023 to finally release. Don't despair, as this is the perfect time to brush up on your backlog and catch up before some of the industry's biggest sequels come to your favorite home console. In that spirit, we're headed back to 2018's God of War on this edition of GI Live to get reacquainted with Kratos and Atreus ahead of Ragnarok's 2022 release date (fingers crossed).
Watch on Twitch!
Join your hosts, Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they return to the Norse world of gods and monsters live on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT. We'll be playing the first two hours of the game, letting you know why it's one of our favorites of the last few years, and discussing where we think the next game is going (spoilers: Norse mythology is wild).
If you need a reminder of God of War's greatness, be sure to check out our review, where we said:
Years ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos' reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series' evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.

In an announcement that was expected ages ago following the appearance of an age rating, Alan Wake Remastered is confirmed to be heading to Switch this Autumn / Fall as an eShop-only release. Previously released on PS4/PS5 and Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, the pleasing news is that it'll be running natively, not as a Cloud version.
Originally released on Xbox 360 way back in 2010, Alan Wake made waves and won over plenty of fans for its approach to episodic storytelling, structuring itself as a psychological thriller with action gameplay. As a follow up to its terrific work on the Max Payne series it further established Remedy's reputation, even if some jokes have been made over the years about Wake being overly keen to stress he's a writer - though it is key to the story - and the classic hoodie under jacket attire.

        <updated>2022-05-12T16:18:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix released the first official teaser for its upcoming Resident Evil series, which hits the subscription service on July 14, and in it, Umbrella is hiding something. Fortunately, we know exactly what it is: there’s a hidden Easter egg that leads to a second, more gruesome zombie-filled trailer within the initial one. 
The first teaser, released publicly by Netflix, is pretty by-the-books. It tees up the show’s premise and showcases the main protagonists beginning a new life in New Raccoon City in 2022. Then it quickly transitions to 2036, at which point, much of the world seems overrun with zombies. There are a few of the video game’s most famous zombies to be found in the first teaser, but the second teaser is sure to give fans more of what they’re looking for: terror, zombie dogs, lickers, and more. 
Check out the first teaser below, and then we’ll show you how to get to the second teaser: 


You might have caught it yourself, but just in case you didn’t, at the 24-second mark in the first teaser, a URL appears on-screen: umbrellaisjoy.com.
If you head there, it takes you to a mock-up of what an Umbrella pharmaceutical website might look like. However, after a few seconds, it transitions into a Netflix Resident Evil site, at which point you should see the second teaser embedded. 
This second teaser, in our opinion, is significantly better than the first, at least in terms of bringing the scares and horror we want out of anything related to Resident Evil. Check it out for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

EA announced in March of 2021 that it was delaying its next Need For Speed game out of 2021 and into 2022 so that Criterion could instead focus on development of Battlefield 2042 alongside DICE. Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. 
We can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs. [1/3]

Now, as you can see in the tweets above, Codemasters goes just short of saying it and Criterion are working on the Need For Speed expected to release this year. It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. 
Personally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s "Get Low" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest. 
What do you hope to see in the future for Need For Speed? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Sonic the Hedgehog is a brand that's enjoying a boom in mainstream attention right now, with the success of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie luring in fans old and new. As a brand, though, it's maintained a strong presence online even in quieter times, with the enthusiast fanbase in particular celebrating the IP in many ways with fanart, music and videos.
In recent days and weeks, though, a number of Sonic-focused creators have highlighted that their content is getting flagged as 'Made For Kids' on YouTube, even though they've not marked their content as such when it was uploaded. This seems to be driven by an algorithm, with appeals rejected almost instantly by YouTube, and the impact is reduced visibility and monetisation for the videos.

The most recent edition featured many exciting titles like Ooblets, We Are OFK, TABS, and Soundfall, but some notable names were missing from the indie show. These are the seemingly vanished indie games confirmed for Switch, forcing us to rely on forming ritualistic prayer circles, hoping they'll show up at any event with new information in tow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following yesterday's tease that an Optimus Prime Lego set was in development and slated to release this June, Lego has given us all of the details we need, and it looks to be one of the coolest sets yet. Inspired by Optimus Prime's G1 cartoon roots, this set consists of 1,508 pieces and retails for $169.99. The level of detail in Optimus' robot form is spot on, but more impressive yet, the 19 points of articulation allow for this build to transform into vehicle form, without having to disassemble it.

Optimus' chest can open up to store the Matrix of Leadership. He also comes equipped with accessories that you build, like his blaster, an energon cube, and an energy axe that you can swap with his hand. The set will be on store shelves on June 1. No word was given if this will just be a one-off with the Transformers license, or if more robots in disguise will be on the way. Take a look at the gallery below to see just how impressive this build is.]]></summary>

This is a very broad topic for discussion, so that means I also get to say 'ludonarrative dissonance' (we also describe 'ludonarrative harmony' as its opposite). Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the "It's me, Blorko!" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

Konami is not the company it used to be, depending on who you ask. It's always had a hand in pachinko machines and mobile releases. It also had a heavy hand in standard video game releases with franchises such as Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, etc. Konami isn’t too concerned with the latter these days. However, it is releasing the highly-anticipated TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection this year, and its focus has continued to shift into pachinko and mobile releases. That move has paid off because mobile games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, which is also available on consoles and PC, have helped Konami establish one of its most successful years of all time, as reported by Eurogamer.

This news comes by way of an update posted today by the official Bethesda Twitter account which explains that both teams behind Starfield and Redfall, which are Bethesda Game Studios and Arkane Austin respectively, need more time to ensure the games are the best they can be. 
An update on Redfall and Starfield. pic.twitter.com/pqDtx26Uu6
May 12, 2022
Redfall was announced just last year with a planned release for sometime in the summer of this year while Starfield, which was revealed nearly four years ago, was expected to release on November 11, 2022. Now, players will have to wait roughly a year to play both.
Both will launch on Xbox Game Pass now that Bethesda is owned by Microsoft. It's unclear when we'll get our first deep-dive looks at both of these games but considering Bethesda said "soon" in its update today, there's a good chance they'll show up at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase happening on June 12.

If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is another take on the popular strategy franchise from the hands of Omega Force – developer of Fire Emblem Warriors on the Switch and 3DS.

Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of classic Chucks, or someone who’s always wanted shoes emblazoned with your favorite pocket monster on them, then you’re in luck because Pokémon and Converse are teaming up again to do just that. 
Back in January, Converse released a line of shoes that featured Jigglypuff, Meowth, Squirtle, and more, and now, the company has announced its next line of Pokémon shoes, as reported by Kotaku. This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. 

As you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. 
First off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. 
In the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that.

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.
Sadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loot River, the pixely roguelike with a bit of Souls and a bit of Tetris, is all about making multiple attempts to navigate weird dungeons made of moving platforms, before dying and starting again. It's one of those games that's perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that's going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego is great at keeping secrets. The latest surprise for Lego is sets based on the Transformers license, and it's happening soon. Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:
Begin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43
May 11, 2022
Lego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.
I'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)
What do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?
I'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days ago, the expected release of Songs Of Conquest turned into the expected release of Songs Of Conquest into early access. There are times when such a pivot might dramatically change the angle you'd need to review a game from.


This isn't really one of those times, because I think I'd be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to "figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize" could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

She’s playing a game called Wordscapes, which is an excellent tool for helping kids practice spelling and discover new words. My daughter and I worked out a deal that if she plays 20 minutes of Wordscapes, she can then scamper upstairs to play Roblox with her friends for the next two hours. She balked at the idea at first but has taken to enjoying Wordscapes. She periodically asks me for help and cashes in her in-game coins for answers when she has them, but the game is helping her learn, and I’m grateful for it.

It used to take up practically all of my time, and now it's sat there neglected on my PC for the better part of a year or so. Even with King Kong and Godzilla arriving in the game today, I'm still playing Fortnite over it, which says it all, really.
Why did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I'd become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it's changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there's been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.

However, that’s where the known quantities end, save for the next EA Sports PGA Tour which was delayed to early 2023, because Quarter 4, which encompasses the January 2023 to March 2023 time period, contains four unknowns: Major IP, Partner Title, Remake, and Sports Title. 
EA notes on the slide that these four titles scheduled for Q4 of the 2023 Fiscal Year “have not yet been publicly disclosed,” which is why the names of those games aren’t listed on the slide. However, those unknowns have us thinking, and theorizing, what they might be.

Here’s everything announced during today’s May 2022 Indie World Showcase:
Ooblets
Developed by Glumberland, there’s a good chance Ooblets is already a game you’ve played. That’s because it was previously released in early access on Xbox One and PC back in 2020. However, it’s now making its way to Switch, potentially in 1.0 form. It’s the same game, which is to say it’s a very cute farming/life simulation game where you control a highly-customizable character to grow Ooblets upon Ooblets.

This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which reports that Totoki said this while also mentioning he doesn’t want to make comments on “the competitor’s strategy,” with the likely competitor being Microsoft and its Xbox Game Pass service. Xbox releases its first-party games onto Xbox Game Pass on launch day and it’s a big pull for the subscription service. PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has revealed in the past that even with the company’s upcoming revamp of PS Plus, it does not plan to launch first party games there, and Totoki’s latest comments echo that.

Games Montreal released a 13-minute video that delivers a deep look at Gotham Knights' combat, city exploration, suit customization, and the differences between protagonists Nightwing and Red Hood. I walked away from this footage with mixed feelings yet still plenty of excitement for the game's October 25 release.
First, let's start with a positive: It has plenty of the Arkham formula in its coding. The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins. Now, the bad: It also reminded me of Crystal Dynamics' Marvel's Avengers game – solely based on the sheer amount of items needed to craft suits and powers. Seeing that element made me think we will be …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I booted up Citizen Sleeper last night, I had no idea what I was in for. I had seen some buzz about it online and figured I’d give it a go – it was on Xbox Game Pass, after all, and the key art looked precisely the slick and punchy cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic I especially like. Little did I know, a few hours later, I’d be playing a game that I’d recommend to anyone at this point. 
Now, I’m about four hours in, and there’s the potential to crash and burn, but something tells me it’s not going to. Citizen Sleeper, as a game, is somewhat hard to explain: It’s a sci-fi, narrative RPG with no combat (at least so far), a dice-rolling mechanic that dictates everything, minor survival systems, and a rotating cast of characters that you’ll immediately want more of upon meeting them.

Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

That’s why it’s been understandably boxed into the fighting/simulation genre. Outside of a few collectible card games and general manager sims, the genre has rarely strayed beyond its competitive roots, and I think that’s a shame. Wrestling can offer so much more to video games. 
The upcoming WrestleQuest is a great example of what you can do with wrestling games if you apply a bit of creativity. The title transforms the core concepts of the sport into a 16-bit RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger. It’s such a refreshing idea, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out when it launches later this year. WWE re…]]></summary>

While I'm still working on it, publishers and movie producers have already shown great interest. So allow me to treat you, reader dear, to some samples and worldbuilding notes from 1/1, the first drop of the Non-Fungible Future saga.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma's panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda's enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's "weird and creepy", and has recently been looking for something new to play. "I’d really like to play a dark, scary game," she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. 
It was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly 30 years of partnership, EA Sports and FIFA, the international governing body of association football, are parting ways after the release of this year's soccer video game. The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.
With the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, "Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there." 
Outside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.
Our unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC," says Weber. "That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come."
This year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.
How do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.

Sure, he’s appeared in franchises like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Marvel vs. Capcom, and more – he’s even set to be one of the main protagonists in the upcoming Marvel’s Midnight Suns due out later this year – but if you want to experience a Strange-centric story akin to something like Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, you’re out of luck.

They know an important message is to follow, and that everybody in voice chat needs to hear it. Often, when Michael Pusateri is in a work meeting at NBCUniversal that’s going sideways, the same comms command enters his head. "Check, check. Shut up, everyone."


“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the successful launches of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars: Squadrons, Electronic Arts is finding its place in a galaxy far, far away. Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind the Jedi title, is overseeing production for three different Star Wars games: a strategy title, a first-person shooter, and a sequel to Jedi.
I don't know what to expect from the first two games, but I expect Jedi to be a direct sequel that reunites fans with protagonist Cal Kestis, who is still trying to find his place in a troubled time with the Empire on the rise. If Respawn goes in this direction, here's what I hope to see:
The Light and Dark Side of the Force
Force Turmoil
A Gruesome Death for the Poncho
Play as BD-1
Larger Environments
More of the Same with the Lightsaber and Fighting
A Connection to The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian show, but I didn't expect to see one from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars fans believe BD-1 was in the show, meaning he's been around for over twenty years. How awesome would it be to see BD-1 return to that location and show us why he was there in the first place?
And now I'd like to hear what you want to see from Respawn's next Jedi game? Do you want Cal back? Would you rather have someone else in his place? If so, who? Also, if he does return, where do you think his story goes?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. 
According to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: "While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, "The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next." Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. 


Of course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that it will be hosting an Indie World Showcase tomorrow. 
The showcase will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, and it will run for roughly 20 minutes. As the name implies, the games showcased will be indies, so don’t expect to see the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or anything like that here. However, if it’s like the most recent Indie World Showcase that aired in December, we could be in for some indie treats. 
Tune in May 11 at 7:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on upcoming indie games headed to Nintendo Switch. #IndieWorld

May 10, 2022
That December showcase came with the release of Chicory: A Colorful Tale on Switch, a new look at Sea of Stars, and several game reveals, and it was a great time. Hopefully, tomorrow’s 20-minute presentation lives up to that.  As you might have guessed, fans are already preparing their ritual circles in hopes that Hollow Knight’s sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong, makes an appearance, just as they did ahead of the last Indie World Showcase. Naturally, there’s no word on if Silksong will make an appearance tomorrow, but it’d be a great moment if it did appear. 
While waiting for tomorrow’s showcase, catch up on everything announced in the December Indie World Showcase, and then read Game Informer’s list of our most anticipated indie releases for 2022. If you’re looking for an indie to play today, be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 indies to play right now.

The folks at Warner Bros. Montreal feel the same way and have released a 13+ minute gameplay walkthrough featuring two members of the bat family, Nightwing and Red Hood. Not only do we get to see plenty of new gameplay, but the studio has also announced Gotham Knights is officially available to preorder as of today.
Gotham Knights' game director Geoff Ellenor introduces the walkthrough you can watch in the video above. The footage is from about halfway through the game's story and begins by following Nightwing as he patrols the city, scouting out scoundrels from the rooftops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released its 2021-22 Fiscal Year financial results and these include updated numbers for its long-running Pokémon series. 
In the results, Nintendo calls Pokémon a first-party franchise, which some might not consider true since Game Freak, an independent party, develops most of the Pokémon games. However, Nintendo invests heavily in the franchise, and Pokémon games have always been released exclusively on Nintendo consoles. So, it’s hard not to call it a first-party franchise. On that note, Pokémon was Nintendo’s most successful property in the fiscal year that began in April 2021 and ended this past March.

Well, we found the lone warrior keeping Babylon's Fall alive, and sat down to have a chinwag with him about the appeal of the game, and exactly what they were up to when they found themselves the only living inhabitant in its Tower of Babel.

Originally conceived as a Kickstarter stretch goal for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the next JRPG from Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama, this smaller, more action-focused RPG has become both an official prequel to Hundred Heroes and a kind of intermediate stop-gap designed to tide players over until the main event next year. Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on.

Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.
As spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development. According to Broussard, he has no idea how the footage resurfaced but shot down hopes of a complete, playable build by describing these demos as a “smattering of barely populated test …]]></summary>

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). 
But somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3080 12GB is a little-known variant of the RTX 3080 released late last year. As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. 
That performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Companies behind popular movies such as "Tesla", "The Expendables 3" and "The Protege" are using a DMCA subpoena shortcut to expose alleged BitTorrent pirates. This option is much cheaper than filing regular lawsuits. While a clerk at a federal court in Hawaii signed the subpoena, this strategy is not undisputed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m testing an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti this week. No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?


“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp. But the best graphics cards aren’t huge as a rule, and when it’s got to the point where new GPUs can’t easily fit into a standard mid-tower PC case, it might be time for some course correction.

You blast through procedurally generated woods and sewers, bursting enemies for cash and channeling your profits into a skill tree that's also your own psyche. It's rad, basically, but its roguelite dusting doesn't quite hit the mark when a literal nightmare is turning into a metaphorical one.

Now known as Remnants Of The Rift, I've been putting this toe-tapping roguelike through its paces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.
Upon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.
That realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.

Eurogamer have confirmed that the listing is accurate, too. We don't know yet whether this will also apply to PC players, of course, but it’s highly likely to be the same across all platforms.

Ravenholm did feature, albeit briefly, in Noclip's original documentary, but now Noclip producer Danny O’Dwyer has decided it's time to show off a bit more of it, interspersing his gameplay footage with some critical context for what’s going on and the ideas behind it.

Games that are best enjoyed with a notepad often involve some mystery, or require drawing strange symbols or shapes that can't be quickly or easily replicated on your PC. They might involve hurried arithmetic, amateurish maps, doodled floorplans, scatter-brained lists. In these cases it transpires that the giant machine whirring three inches from your nose just won't cut it. Sometimes you gotta use a pencil. Here are the 9 best games to play with a notepad.

The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.

Like a seasoned ronin, the combat is clean and refined. The story is simple and elegant. The visuals are straight out of a classic samurai flick. But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits! The lack of enemy variety hurts what could've been a sensational hike - but it's still a trek worth embarking on if you break it up with a few pitstops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I brought you word that some of Logitech's most popular gaming mice were on sale at Amazon UK, and now I'm back to say that you should spare a thought for a lesser-known cult favourite: the Logitech G305 Lightspeed. This wireless mouse is going for just £24, an absolute bargain price for a critically-acclaimed gaming mouse with a high-end Hero optical sensor, six programmable buttons, a lightweight design and rock-solid wireless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardware man James recently covered the best Micro SD cards for the Steam Deck, so we thought you might want to know that a selection of rather giant memory cards have been discounted over at Amazon UK and US today.
For UK folks, you can now double your Steam Deck storage (!) for £47, or triple (!!) your storage for £132. Meanwhile, over in the US, you'll pay $65 or $136, respectively. Either way, you're getting a good deal on a high performance Micro SD card that works surprisingly well* in the Steam Deck versus the built-in SSD.

I'm a little surprised, considering Dust 2 not only took an early lead but has likely been modded into every game which features romance too. But I accept the decision, and our mission continues. This week, I ask you to pick between a trade-off and something with no negative consequences at all: drawbacks, or a load of lasers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[May is a relatively quiet month when it comes to new PC games. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My FixFox journey, not unlike that of the titular little furry protagonist Vix, has been abnormally long and strange. I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

The free, time-limited event is still all about hoovering up medallions for your chosen class, but there are two new elements called Strike Scoring and Strike Medals to consider this time around. Strike Scoring is based on your time spent in Guardian Games playlists and where you rank, while Strike Medals are won by “pulling off some pretty impressive feats, like taking out a ton of enemies with a fancy little combat jig like Shatter,” so Bungie say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never been one for playing aggressively in turn-based tactics games. I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

Well, the game’s development team have taken to Twitter to announce that Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time Remake will be delayed indefinitely, which seems oddly fitting considering the game is about messing with time. It was meant to launch this year, but the game’s already been delayed indefinitely once before.
