        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It's real now".
Reflect on previous Nintendo generations, and you might remember mock-ups of portable GameCube handhelds inspired by the Game Boy Advance SP. If you've ever wanted a real version of something like this, well...that's exactly what console modder and YouTuber 'GingerOfOz' has created.
The modder has been able to shrink this mock-up down to a Game Boy Advance SP-style handheld unit. In truth, it's actually running a "trimmed" Wii motherboard inside of it, which obviously supports Nintendo's library of GameCube games.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Season 3 officially comes to a close with our discussion of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. 
Released August 22, 2017 – less than a year after Uncharted 4 – Lost Legacy puts Chloe Frazer in the starring role for the first time. She's not alone, however; former antagonist Nadine Ross partners with her, leading to an odd-couple-style treasure hunt that may be shorter than Uncharted 4 but was just as entertaining. Prior to this, Naughty Dog batted around other combinations of characters for this adventure including Sully and Sam Drake. How did the team turn The Lost Legacy around so quickly after A Thief's End? What's the deal with that "wimpy" train explosion? Listen here to hear the answers to these questions and more. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), and former Game Informer intern O'Dell Harmon Jr. (@ODellHarmonJr) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Uncharted game to date. Tune to also find out the game series that will be the topic for Season 4! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

In other news, we received a lovely surprise when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection was announced for later this year, and LEGO have announced an expansion for the Super Mario sets with the Adventures With Peach Starter Pack.
Now it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

A digital remaster of a classic Indiana Jones pinball table made its debut yesterday in Pinball FX3 and while many appreciate the effort, a lot of the game's community isn't quite as happy about the asking price of this new DLC.
For just a single table, fans are being asked to fork out $14.99 / £13.49. While Pinball FX3 is a free-to-download title, the table DLC in the game doesn't normally cost this much. In an official statement via social media, Zen Studios explained how it simply wanted to give fans the most "authentic experience" possible.

This week's episode is hitting a little later than usual. The reason? Our local comic shops in Minnesota didn't get any Marvel comic books last week. We felt the show would be a little light without them, so we held off until we could get our hands on those books. The wait was worth it: The first issue of Strange is an absolute delight and a fantastic direction for the Sorcerer Supreme to go in.
Most of this episode is dedicated to new comic book releases that hit this week and last. We also dive into The Batman, which I give a score and review to, and also discuss Gotham Knights' new release date!

From Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week. Each episode also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.

EA has released a new two-minute look at gameplay from its upcoming Dead Space Remake and it features a quick look at Isaac Clarke laying waste to a Necromorph. 
Revealed today during a special Dead Space Remake developer update stream focused on the title’s audio, this look at gameplay showcased a small snippet of protagonist Isaac walking around a very spooky section of the Ishimura before he’s attacked by a Necromorph. Fortunately, he has his newly-remade 211-V Plasma Cutter.

But, back when Square Enix was marketing the game, it revealed a season pass in a Japanese Nintendo Direct, which left a sour taste in many fans' mouths. Not only that, the iconic Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife is tied to this pass, called a Prize Pass.

A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that manage…]]></summary>

WWE 2K22’s long road to release stands as a redemption story as dramatic as any of the TV storylines. The series took a few years off to regroup following the trainwreck that was 2019’s 2K20, and the time away allowed it to learn some useful new holds. Though it doesn’t catapult the franchise to bold new heights, a revamped gameplay engine and a renewed focus on approachability make it the most entertaining – and most of all, playable – WWE game in some time.
The new engine strips away some of the complicated mechanics that made the pre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These options should really be industry standard by now.
When it comes to accessibility features in video games, things have improved somewhat in recent years, with many developers now consciously providing elementary options that tweak the gameplay experience to better suit players of different abilities and with specific impairments. There remains much work to be done, though, to promote industry-wide understanding and communicate the vital importance of implementing these options for many gamers.
In this feature Isabelle Meyer looks at a handful of the most useful accessibility features already present in many Nintendo Switch games and identifies areas where developers and publishers could make improvements to allow a wider audience to enjoy their output. This is very much a non-definitive list, but highlights options that should really be implemented as 'industry standard' these days.

Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Konami has announced that the free-to-play Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel has surpassed 20 million downloads in less than two months.
It's a huge milestone for the game that only released back on January 19th, and while it's not clear how many copies have been downloaded on the Switch, we'd wager the system's handheld capabilities would make it a cosy home for the digital card game.

The year is 2022, and there's another physical Game Boy release on the way! And it's Analogue Pocket compatible! It's called Glory Hunters, and it pulls from the looks of A Link to the Past, plus that iconic green-on-green monochrome Game Boy colour palette. But there's a twist: You progress through the game by earning achievements, not by collecting a bunch of triangles or gems or whatever.
With over a thousand achievements, 20+ hours of gameplay, a non-linear story, and a huge map that's "aiming to be the biggest one in a Game Boy game", Glory Hunters sounds like it'll be the perfect companion for many long, night-time car rides. That's how we all play Game Boy, right?

In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

Elden Ring is a hard game. It’s a From Software Soulsborne game so that’s no surprise. Be it a mouse and keyboard or a controller, bosses like Godrick the Grafted will undoubtedly give you some trouble in Elden Ring. 
Now, imagine fighting Godrick with some bananas. Like real edible bananas that you can find at any grocery store. Sounds impossible, right? Well, somehow it’s not because SuperLouis_64 on Twitter recently posted a video showing him do just that, as reported by Eurogamer. 
THE BANANA CONTROLLER WORKS 🍌
#ELDENRING pic.twitter.com/ZOjzYb8Sgo
March 8, 2022
As you can see in the video above, SuperLouis_64 plays Elden Ring with bananas as well as some of us do on intended controllers (better than me, at least – I’ll be honest). He seems to be using bananas on the bottom left to control his Tarnished’s movement while his right hand seems to use three bananas to control attacks and dodges. Of course, this is pure speculation because the official Banana control scheme for Elden Ring has not yet been released by From Software (we eagerly await the day, though). 
News of SuperLouis_64 tropical feat comes just days after someone beat Elden Ring in under three hours without dying a singe time. In other news, I am not as good at Elden Ring as I thought I was, it seems. 
If you need help in Elden Ring, Game Informer has you covered, though. Check out our guide on how to beat Godrick the Grafted and then read our guide on Elden Ring’s best rune farming location. After that, check out this guide on how to find Elden Ring’s best summon spirit, and then read about this tactic that will help you easily beat every boss in Elden Ring.

Another month, another roundup of U.S. NPD numbers and not surprisingly, Elden Ring was the best-selling game of February. 
Elden Ring is also the best-selling game of 2022 year-to-date and what’s more is that it is secured the second-best launch month sales of any title in the past 12 months, coming in second only to last November’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. On top of that, after just one month on the U.S. video game market, Elden Ring is already ranked as the fifth best-selling game over the past year. It ranked first on both Xbox consoles and PC, coming in second on PlayStation hardware.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have gathered up some crucial Windows drivers for the Steam Deck, improving performance for those who want to ditch the default SteamOS and replace it with Windows 10. GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix first released RPG classic Chrono Trigger on PC in 2018, it was in a sorry state. Their 'updated' version was worse than the 1995 original, with blurry sprites, ugly menus, an incongruous font, and other problems. But they fixed it up a lot with patches, and now, almost four years since the last patch, they've applied a fresh coat of polish with another welcome update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirty years ago, a small team based in Kyoto, Japan, came together to create a new kind of action game. Drawing inspiration from prior projects, that team released Super Mario Bros. in 1985 – a title that would go on to help console gaming step back from the brink of ruin. Since then, Mario’s influence has spread far beyond the games in which he appears. He helped turn Nintendo into an industry leader, and became a cultural icon. Super Mario Bros. started a revolution, and in the process, became one of the most recognizable franchises in the world.
This article originally appeared in the November 2015 issue of Game Informer. We're re-sharing this story today as a part of Super Mario's 35th anniversary celebration.

The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego Mario has been a hit for Nintendo it seems because both it and Lego are continuing to collaborate to create new experiences and Lego-vized versions of beloved characters in the Mushroom Kingdom. 
After revealing Lego Luigi last year, who is playable alongside Lego Mario and all of the Super Mario Lego sets revealed thus far, Nintendo has now revealed that everyone’s favorite Mushroom Kingdom princess is becoming a Lego this August. What’s more is that Peach is getting her very own course too: Adventures with Peach Starter Course. 
Fun-packed new #LEGOSuperMario Expansion Sets and characters are coming later this year, including the fabulous new LEGO Peach! #Mar10Day

March 10, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, Lego Peach is looking great! She’ll be an excellent addition in existing sets, but she fits right in to the new Super Mario 64, Super Mario World, and Super Mario 3D World expansion sets joining the Mushroom Kingdom Lego universe. 
Nintendo (kinda) revealed these new expansions today for Mario Day alongside the new Peach figurine, but it didn’t go as far as to name them. However, fans of Mario will surely recognize which game each set is inspired by. The one on the left in the picture below is clearly reminiscent of Super Mario 64, the one in the middle looks a lot like Yoshi’s home/hideout/do dinosaurs own property in the Mushroom Kingdom (?) from Super Mario World, and finally, the set on the right features a cat goomba and climbing tree seen throughout Super Mario 3D World. 
Lego Peach and the Adventures with Peach Starter Course set will be available this August. As for the new expansion sets, a release date has not yet been revealed. 
For more about Lego, check out Lego Luigi and then check out this official boxed Lego Super Mario 64 set after that.

I don’t know about you, but Lego Star Wars was my go-to party game in middle school. The hilarious adventures I had when playing through the classic trilogy and its prequels continue to be some of my favorite co-op memories. The Skywalker Saga is slated to amplify the comedy and expand the universe. A new behind-the-scenes trailer provides exciting details about what the dev team is putting together for Star Wars fans, and it looks marvelous. For instance, assistant game director Dewi Roberts mentioned the sheer level of freedom that players wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all about our favourite mounts in video games - as in, animals that carry you around in games. Not cars. Machines don't count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.
There are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.

Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they're releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.

Persona 4 Arena Ultimax makes its triumphant return with new ports releasing on PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch next week. I've had the game in my hands for the last couple of nights fighting in and out of the Midnight Channel, exploring this new version of the fighting game pseudo-sequel to Persona 3 and 4, and grasping Arc System Work's mechanics once again.
Well, what exactly is this port of Ultimax, and is it different from the prior release on PS3 and Xbox 360? To put …]]></summary>

Joining the likes of Microsoft and Nintendo and dozens of other studios and publishers who have done the same, PlayStation is showing its support for Ukraine by effectively cutting Russia off from its services and titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like "Tortoise", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is the latest company to halt sales and shipments of its products to Russia amidst its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 
Joining the likes of Microsoft and PlayStation and dozens of other game studios, Nintendo has suspended all shipments to Russia for the “foreseeable future.” Still, the company did not say this was in support of Ukraine like most publishers and studios have, as reported by IGN. The publication reached out to Nintendo to ask if it’d be providing a message of support for Ukraine, and a Nintendo spokesperson said, “We would like to express our concern for all those affected by the conflict.” 
“We have decided to suspend shipping all Nintendo products to Russia for the foreseeable future,” Nintendo told IGN. “This is due to considerable volatility surrounding the logistics of shipping and distributing physical goods.” 
This news comes days after Nintendo placed the Russian eShop into maintenance mode, which prevents users from buying digital games, effectively suspending all sales and downloads in the country. As IGN points out, this wasn’t necessarily done in support of Ukraine either, at least not directly and publicly. Nintendo said its payment service no longer processed Russian Rubles, forcing the eShop to close temporarily. 
On top of all of this, Nintendo delayed Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp yesterday due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It did not announce a new release date for the game.

Gran Turismo has been a gold standard for the simulation-racing genre for over 25 years. The franchise has continually served as a showcase for PlayStation’s latest hardware both from visual and technical standpoints. Gran Turismo 7 is no different in this regard; the racing has never felt more precise, nor have the vehicles ever looked truer to life. However, in the time since that initial entry, the field has caught up to Gran Turismo. This new entry is still an excellent driving simulation, but it’s no longer lapping the competition.

Trek to Yomi is a stylish action title that may not have been on your radar before, but its latest trailer during today's State of Play presentation shows off why it may be worth keeping an eye on. 
The game, developed by Shadow Warrior makers Flying Wild Hog, is an action sidescrolling take on classic samurai films. You play as a young swordsman fighting to protect his village and keep a vow to his dying Master. Human enemies aren't the only threat; the trailer shows off spectral warriors, grotesque swamp creatures, and other supernatural elements. The bloody swordplay looks even sharper under the striking monochromatic presentation, a stylistic choice that further evokes the game's cinematic inspirations.

Ever wanted to tackle the challenges of Returnal with a friend? Now you can! Coming with the Ascension update on March 22, players can tackle the entirety of Returnal in co-op mode. Well, almost the entire journey. Another new content offering coming with this update, The Tower of Sisyphus, cannot be played in co-op mode. This new locale is a gauntlet of trials, tribulations, and death. While we don't know exactly what to expect with the Tower, it's fairly safe to assume that it will feature some randomization elements, and possibly some new story beats, enemies, and bosses to add to the already impressive Returnal roster.
Apparently, you can access the tower fairly early on in the game, after obtaining the Icarian Grapnel (this is off the second major boss).  I'm not sure which is more exciting – the prospect of bringing in a friend to take on Returnal with or tackling new Returnal content! Let's just go with it's awesome to see new stuff coming to Returnal this late in the game, and maybe the teamplay will even coax some new players into the haunting world of Atropos. Check out the new trailer right here.

Revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, The DioField Chronicle's trailer begins with a storybook-like retelling of a war that ravaged a region. The Alliance fought against the Empire and in the end, it seems the Empire was left standing. However, the Kingdom of Alletain remain untouched during the war and now, the Empire is taking them on. The trailer seems to indicate that you, the player, are in control of Alletain and its soldiers.

Square Enix has plenty of long-running powerhouse franchises under its belt, from Final Fantasy to Dragon Quest. But every so often, the acclaimed publisher takes a chance on a new idea, and that looks like something we’ll be seeing more of thanks to the establishment of Luminous Productions.
Luminous Productions was formed for the sole purpose of developing new IPs, and for its first project, Forspoken, the studio wasn’t afraid to step outside of its comfort zone and bring in new talent, like Gary Whitta (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and Amy Hennig (Uncharted), to realize its ambition. The open-world RPG transports…]]></summary>

Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins launches next week, but if you’re still on the fence after previous trailers as well as a pair of demos, one final demo will become available on PlayStation consoles today.
Like the two previous demos, this one is totally free and can be accessed on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. There's no word on what it entails, but the past two demos let players explore sizable dungeons so it's probably safe to assume this third slice offers a similarly substantial sample. 
Strange of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin launches March 18 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read the PC specs for the game here.]]></summary>

This news comes by way of Axios, which reports that these eight claims will be added to the claims of former Sony IT security analyst Emma Majo. She filed a lawsuit against the company last year, alleging that “Sony discriminated against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men.” 
Majo sought court approval in 2021 to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit, stating that she filed the suit on behalf of herself and all women who have worked for Sony before and those still working there. Then, in Februar…]]></summary>

Elden Ring has been out for a couple of weeks and while people continue to shout from the rooftops how much they love the game – Game Informer gave it a rare 10 out of 10 – there are those asking for features found in other games. 
Case in point, Elden Ring is void of a true pause button, something players are asking for. This means that if your dog starts throwing up on the couch next to you mid-boss fight (can you tell I’m speaking from experience?), you won’t be able to pause. You can either continue the fight or address the mess your dog has left behind. Of course, a lot of Elden Ring…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has created a new YouTube channel specifically for soundtracks and other music from various games and projects the company is known for. 
Brought to our attention by the reporting of Video Games Chronicle, the Japanese game publisher created a YouTube channel called Square Enix Music. The company is hosting several playlists featuring the soundtracks of many of its RPG series and games. Want to listen to the Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack? It's there! In the mood for tunes from SaGa Frontier II? There's a playlist waiting! Even Balan Wonderworld's music can be found on the channel. Kick back and relax to your favorite Square soundtracks, just like I am while writing this article and head-bobbing to the Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers OST.
The opening of the Square Enix Music channel comes with the addition of over 5,500 Square Enix tracks that can now be listened to by YouTube Music users. These songs have long been available on other services such as Apple Music and Spotify. Still, it's great to see this incredible collection readily available to enjoy in even more places. If you're new to YouTube Music and looking to listen there, you can do it for free, though there will be some ads every once in a while. Upgrading to a premium subscription will allow users to download songs for offline listening and eliminate the commercials from the experience.
Which Square Enix soundtracks are your favorites? I'm pretty partial to FFVIII and even incorporated some of its songs into my wedding. Let me know your favorites in the comments below!]]></summary>

Forspoken’s protagonist Frey Holland finds herself inexplicably thrust out of her native New York City and into the magic-laden world of Athia. To survive until she can find her way back home, Frey must learn to fight, but the game’s combat system shies away from mundane weapons. However, getting through Athia’s dangers means she, and the player, needs to master magical combat.
“Magic is really at the heart of Forspoken,” says co-director Takefumi Terada. “So, we’ve really made sure to make a diverse array of magic available for players.” And it looks like the team has done just that. From melee-type spells to mystic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Half the point of the Steam Deck is that it’s portable, but the other half is that it’s a PC. With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have A Nice Death is a roguelike where you take control of an overworked Death, whose employees have ditched their jobs and run amok. You’ll journey into the bowels of your company, find the miscreants, and scythe them back into work.
Despite the game’s grim backdrop, it’s a joyful experience stacked with cracking combat and funny characters. The moreish roguelike hook is there, albeit with some early access hiccups to overcome. Give it some time and it could really shine, but whether it’ll get lost in the Steam release cycle before it even has a chance to fill out remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Valhalla enters its endgame phase with its final DLC Dawn Of Ragnarök, the very concept for which is kind of a big honking spoiler, so consider yourself forewarned.
The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every citybuilder is about keeping the districts of your city in balance, but Airborne Kingdom makes it rather more literal. As your flying metropolis expands, you have to apply propulsion machines - fabric wings, gigantic oars, pedal-powered rotors - to make sure it doesn't tip dangerously this way or that. 

It's delightful, and after a year on Epic's game store, the Epic Games Store, it's available on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring hides its open world's beauty behind a layer of difficulty, sure, but it's nothing compared to the Disgaea series. These colourful JRPGs have been hiding some of the deepest and most satisfying levelling systems in all of gaming behind the world's most obnoxious anime characters for years now.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There's also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

That leaves the possibility of another judgment, potentially in excess of $250 million.

Previously due on the 24th of May, it's now slated for the 11th of October. Sounds like Squeenix hope to make it the start of a new series, so they're taking time to help ensure it's proper good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

Since the game's release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring may be FromSoftware's most approachable Soulsborne game but it's still tough as nails. Especially when you can't pause the action and take a breather, or like, dash downstairs because the microwave has pinged. But thankfully there's a mod that lets you do just this, giving you peace of mind when faced with a bleep from your beloved 800W box. Worth a look, I reckon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babylon's Fall is an online action-RPG developed by PlatinumGames, the devs behind excellent hack n' slashers like NieR Automata and Bayonetta. This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.
But the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!

If there's no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you've either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are "cringe". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe. Here are nine minor NPCs who became major players.

Basically we're talking about when you do normal work in games that isn't hero-slaying-monster type stuff, you know?
A really bumper number of digressions this week, though. The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast. Plus, Nate has a Cavern Of Lies this week which is themed about, er, Nate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. 
A long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.”

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.
There's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing "hahaha" of old. And it makes me sad.

It's a "playable short" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.
In fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.

As if Elden Ring wasn't enough game to be getting on with, we also had strategy behemoth Total War: Warhammer 3 alongside surprise hit Lost Ark.

Sadly, I come bearing terrible news. March is yet another jam-packed month for new releases, with huge titles such as GhostWire: Tokyo and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands threatening to tear our attention away from the wonderful Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve haven’t changed their collective minds on DIY Steam Deck upgrades and repairs; although the portable PC is finally on its way to the earliest reservers, it’s still the company’s stance that you shouldn’t open it up and make hardware changes yourself. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.


Valve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox is a delighful name to say. I keep calling it Fikfok, once by mistake and then the rest of the time on purpose. You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.
Vix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.

However, if you’re lucky enough to get a Steam Deck in the first round of order fulfilments, you could see improvements that have yet to materialise on Windows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. I'm sorry this month's Letter From The Editor is a bit late. February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  
Of course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen chat about Elden Ring being the most accessible (as in, welcoming to newcomers and easy to pick up) game yet of the collected FromSoft oeuvre. I haven't played nearly as much Elden Ring as Ed or our guides team, but I do feel this statement, while not an exact a lie, definitely needs a lot more qualification than people are giving it. 
In relative terms, one would say that a bowl of hot sick was more enjoyable than eating a bowl of cold sick, for example. Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, "You should do this thing." In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.
