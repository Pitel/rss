Obsidian is in peak form, if you ask me
We're already looking ahead to an amazing year of releases in 2023, but part of me still can't let go of one of my favorite games of last year: Pentiment. Although it was released mid November of 2022, I didn't play it until a month later when we were in the midst of the end of year rush, so I didn't get to give it as much attention as I thought it deserved. So here I am, taking a moment to highlight not only what a great game I think Pentiment is, but also my thoughts on how this game's mere existence, along with its subsequent success, is actually a good thing for the games industry as a whole. Let's get into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long-awaited reset
Assassin's Creed is one of those game series that's been around for decades at this point, and in that time, the titles have evolved a lot. From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there's something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans' requests to heart.
In an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin's Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series' sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are "great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy," they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on "character-driven story" and "the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale." This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I'll be excited to check out a new Assassin's Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.
https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864
Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.
As much as I love hearing that Assassin's Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft's release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it's a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.

Sony has released a new firmware update for its still-far-too-big-for-its-own-good platform PlayStation 5 — Update 22.02-06.50.00, which is now available to download, paves the way for the arrival of the PS5 premium controller DualSense Edge, which will launch worldwide on January 26.
Officially revealed in October 2022, the DualSense Edge is a component-based version of the standard PS5 controller, which comes packaged with various modules to allow complete customization of the premium unit. DualSense Edge features full programmable buttons, as well as adjustable trigger pressure, custom dead-zone positioning, and save states for different users and games. In addition, the DualSense comes with its own storage case, which doubles as a charging dock.

While an impressive piece of technology, the DualSense Edge comes at a cost, namely $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the cost of the digital edition of the PS5 console itself. Sony has also noted that DualSense Edge will have a "moderately" shorter battery life than the original DualSense, which makes the new controller an exceptionally niche purchase.
Can you put a price on adjustable Haptic Feedback? Sony sure has
The PS5 DualSense Edge launches January 26, exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store. It will be made available at other retailers, online and offline, from February 23. For more details, see our previous report.

It's a big day for Pokémon. The series has finally crossed over the four digit mark for their total number of pocket monsters -- a milestone they celebrated with an nine minute-long video. Another piece of information that shouldn't go overlooked, though, is that they also announced that another patch is on the way in a press release that came alongside the video. The Pokémon Company said that the update will be coming sometime in "late February," although that's as specific as it gets for now.

Scarlet & Violet have been heralded as some of the best entries in the series that we've seen in a few years, but it's undeniable that they got off to a rocky start. Since the release in November, there has already been a 1.1 patch to try to squash some of the games' myriad of bugs -- this new one coming up in February will be 1.2. The only details the press release divulges is that the update "will include bug fixes and add functionality," but also says to "please look forward to more details soon." Some players are hoping to finally see the update integrate Pokémon Go into the mainline series, but as of now, the integration of any new features outside of fixing issues and quality-of-life features is entirely up in the air.

The sinister Plague Doctor skin has returned to the in-game store of Epic Games' juggernaut battle royale title, Fortnite. The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
As noted by Eurogamer, the "Scourge" and "Plague" skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite's rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked "plague doctors" of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.
While Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume's removal, it's not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world's most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.
The COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a "Post-COVID" status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis. In total, some 13.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered since 2020.

Since Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade — or just Fire Emblem as it was known in the West — made its way to the West on the Game Boy Advance thanks to the popularity of Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, the series has filled a cutthroat, tactical RPG void on almost every Nintendo console since – all the way up to the stellar Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the Switch.
Known for wide casts of colourful characters, challenging maps, permadeath, dozens of classes, and more recently matchmaking, the plots of political intrigue often get left out of the Fire Emblem discussion. A shame, because the writers over at Intelligent Systems have put together more than a few decent yarns over the series' 30-year+ history. As such, we expect this month’s Fire Emblem: Engage to have a great story as well, despite much of the conversation being focused on the protagonist’s toothpaste hair.

However, delivery times are 1-2 weeks, and you can now get a functionally identical alternative for half the price. 
It's the iVoler Steam Deck Dock, which normally costs £49.99/$55.99 but is now down to £37.59 in the UK or $44.99 in the US. I've been testing this model for the past few days; here's why I rate it.

After ruling the home console roost for almost a decade, the mid-nineties were a turning point for Nintendo, and not in a “they finally quit cocaine and got their act together” kind of way. After creating their own worst enemy by screwing Sony in an effort to make a CD expansion for the Super Nintendo, they were struggling with getting their own next-generation console to the market. A lot of other companies were touting their fancy 32-bit monstrosities, and Nintendo needed something to convince people that they were still on the cutting edge. Otherwise, they might turn to Phillips, Atari, or 3DO to satiate their need for extra bits.
So, they turned to the inventor of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi, had him put a bow around that virtual reality thing he was tinkerin…]]></summary>

Nintendo has announced that UNO is set to be the next free game trial for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in Europe. The freebie is available to download from the Switch eShop right now, but it won't be playable until the trial begins on 19th January.
The chances are you will have come across UNO before and you don't need us to tell you how the game works (yep, we have also been a part of those long family game nights that get a little too competitive). In one of the few differences between the Switch version and the OG card game, the power of online play lets you play solo against others from around the world — perfect for working on your skills before the next family event.

The next Destiny 2 expansion, Lightfall, is right around the corner. And ahead of Lightfall, Bungie is making a big change to how Armor Mods are handled in Destiny 2.
In a tweet from earlier this week, the Destiny 2 studio announced that all standard Armor Mods in Destiny 2 will be unlocked for every player.
"With big changes coming to buildcrafting in Lightfall, we want to give everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state," reads the update. Notably, this doesn't include non-standard Armor Mods, like Raid and Seasonal Artifact mods.
Armor Mods are essentially what they sound like: tweaks you can make in order to add some beneficial effects. Putting together the right combination is part of making your Destiny 2 build really…]]></summary>

Gameloft's upcoming free-to-play racer, Disney Speedstorm, might not have a specific release date set for it just yet, but this doesn't mean that we are being kept in the dark in regard to which classic Disney characters will be donning a racing suit and heading to the tracks.
It seems that with each trailer and Dev Diary, we see the potential for a whole new batch of racers. What started as seemingly just a bunch of Disney classics (Mickey, Goofy, Donald Duck etc.) has rapidly spread into wider franchises like Pirates of the Caribbean and it is even knocking on the door of some Pixar favourites with the collection of Monsters Inc. drivers.

Surprising no one, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet finds itself in first place once again, bringing in an additional 291,322 copies to make up a cumluative total of 4,630,253 - that's insane. Splatoon 3 isn't too far behind, mind, selling an impressive 107,700 copies to make up a total of 3,795,514. We'd comfortably wager that Splatoon 3 will be passing the 4 million mark in a few weeks.

Marvel Snap might want to ensure that they have a hand as mighty as Thanos this month, as developer Second Dinner has announced that its highly-anticipated PvP Battle Mode will be launching in the digital card battler as soon as this month.
First announced back in the fall of 2022, the Marvel Snap PvP Battle Mode will give players the ability to swiftly and thoroughly pound their pals into mush, slapping down a series of cards designed to ruin everybody's day. I'm looking at you, Agatha Harkness. The update is expected to launch on January 31, though the developers ask players for patience in lieu of any possible last-minute delays or pushbacks.
In addition to PvP Battle Mode, the new update will debut Marvel Snap's official rebalance system, known as "Series Drop". This semi-regular event will see higher-level cards — for example Series 3, 4, and 5 — drop a tier each, increasing their chance of appearance ahead of any newly debuting characters. The team is aiming for one Series Drop per month. It should be noted that the most powerful cards, such as Thanos and Galactus, will not be reduced in rarity. As these fellas are bad boys 4 life.
Finally, Second Dinner notes that is currently investigating the rate at which Tokens are earned, in line with the price of in-store cards. The team hopes to come up with a fair and acceptable way to help Series 3 players push toward the upper echelons of Series 4 and 5 with less frustration. While no specific changes were announced, Second Dinner will continue to experiment with balance tweaks to help expedite progress.
Marvel Snap is available now as a free-to-play title on iOS and Android devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things are looking up
Fire Emblem Engage is nearly here, and we talked quite a bit about it (and the expectations therein) recently in a preview article. At this point the only thing left is a few odds and ends, as the game is set to launch just next week on January 20, 2023.
Until that time, there's a few minor commercials that have popped up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, which provide a closer look at some of the game's major mechanics, and cast.
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 1
The first commercial provides a brief look at the setup of the narrative, which you're probably going to be skipping if you're going in blind. The fantastic elements and the more grounded kingdom hopping angle are briefly mentioned too, as well as quite a few closeups of bond system (including Alear, the main character, and Marth), and some combat animations. It's short, but to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4yHLTCd9Y
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 2
The next commercial focuses more on the party members/Emblem Ring conceit, and has a short "tactics" section that gives us some brief strategic gameplay. The core of this video lies in the opportunities to customize your party, which includes class types and Emblem Ring/Engage pairings (read: equipping party members with the spirits of classic Fire Emblem characters).
Multiple heroes from prior Fire Emblem games are teased as well toward the end of the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5D8Qakq0GM
While short, these clips get the gist of the new entry across. Now all you need to do is wait for some impressions, or for January 20 to hit so you can dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've completed my first play through of Chop Goblins, a "microshooter" from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski. All in all, it took me just under an hour to choppa' da goblins and I'm all up for more of the same, to be honest. I liked time-travelling between Dracula's abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, "NICE TO MEET YOU!", in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the "micro" variety would be grand, I'd love a "microracer". Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I'm desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The big moment is eight minutes in
1000 Pokemon: wow! Well, 1008 to be exact, and we are counting. I've had the phrase "101" embedded in my brain since Pokemon was first released in the '90s, and it's been hard to adjust ever since. When I first heard someone say "there are over 200 Pokemon now in Gold & Silver," I wasn't ready for it. Now time has completely passed me by, and we're at 1008 Pokemon. Just....wow.
You can witness that passage of time in roughly nine minutes by watching the video below, which The Pokemon Company just put up on their official YouTube channel today. Here's a quick primer for the relatively straightforward clip: "Twenty-six years after the release of the original Pokemon games—Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Green Version in Japan—the number of Pokemon discovered has finally surpassed one thousand! Let’s celebrate the occasion with a look back at some of your favorite Pokemon!"
Of course, the big moment here is the "1000th" Pokemon, and that moment comes at roughly eight minutes in. From there they move on to the legendaries of the newest Paldea generation, which might be spoilerish somewhat if you haven't finished the game yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa08Y-fhfTI&t
Time marches on, and so does Pokemon
We're at a crossroads for the series, especially with Pokemon Legends getting tons of praise on various "best of" lists, and Scarlet & Violet leaving a lot to be desired, from a good chunk of the fanbase. While the team is no doubt working on the next thing already (and likely some DLC for Scarlet & Violet), it'll be interesting to see the lessons learned from Legends and the Paldea generation, because there are a lot of them to take in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is the lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system shortly after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

Two more Tera Raid Battle events are coming to Pokémon Scarlet & Violet very soon. Alongside a substantial patch that promises "bug fixes and added functionality" in February, and following the Pokémon Encounter 1008 video, Game Freak and The Pokémon Company have revealed that a new 7-Star Raid is coming to the game along with a cute little Valentine's Day-themed raid (thanks, Serebii!).
The 7-Star Raid is currently shrouded in mystery, but we know it'll come with a Poison Tera Type and will have the Mightiest Mark. You'll also only be able to catch this new 7-Star Pokemon once per save file. The 7-star raid will be available on 27th to 30th January, and again on 10th to 12th February.

Now, if you’re anything like us, you might want to spend the coming months preparing for the release of a new Zelda title by… well, playing more Zelda. It’s a tricky proposition, however, because you certainly don’t want to play too much and find yourself completely burned out by the time Tears of the Kingdom rolls around.

The Legacy GC Wired Controller has the appearance of the classic Game Boy Player controllers from Hori back in the day but with a new lick of colour and some fancy modern features. The button layouts make this a prime option for those out there still using the Game Boy Player (you know who you are), and you have the option to set the D-Pad's analogue inputs to either the left or right stick so those who are up for a challenge can even take on some single-stick Super Smash Bros.

<p>Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Achievements are now part and parcel of the video gaming landscape, but that doesn't mean we have to like them. Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive's lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they've been actively "bad for gaming". So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game? Come and tell us in the comments.

In what's becoming a bit of a familiar story for 2022, game sales for both PC and console are down in 2022 across Europe compared to 2021, Gamesindustry.biz reports. GSD data reveals that despite 159 million game sales across the markets, there's been an overall drop in sales of 7.1%.
However, the Nintendo Switch has still managed to get some good news out of this. It's overall the best-selling console in Europe, only missing out on the top spot in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway — though sales figures from the UK and Germany are not included, it's indeed the same story in the UK for the Switch. That's despite a drop in sales of 15% for the hybrid console. PS5 sales, however, slipped 35% across Europe, with only the Xbox Series X|S reporting growth of 4.4%.

That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they're going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

While the actual release is still two weeks out, publisher Electronic Arts is hoping to get the hype fires going with a new "launch trailer" for its highly anticipated remake, Dead Space. The iconic interstellar horror title makes its grand return January 27 on PC and ninth gen console platforms.
The dramatic, explosive trailer somewhat belies the sinister, slow creep and sense of pervading dread that punctuates Dead Space, making it appear something more of an action movie than a survival horror title. But, as fans will know, the 2008 original was one of the finest examples of the genre, and there's no telling how studio Motive has been able to bolster the excitement, adventure, and nerve-wracking tension of Visceral Games' seminal work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQl9wa3ydE&t=78s&ab_channel=DeadSpace
Having been around the rumor mill more than enough times one would care to remember, the Dead Space remake was finally announced in the summer of 2021, with fans eagerly twiddling their thumbs for the past two years, eager to get their hands on the long-awaited title. The remake retains the narrative of the original game, as engineer Isaac Clarke investigates a distress signal sent by planetary mining vessel the USG Ishimura. Once aboard, Clarke discovers that matters have taken a turn far worse than anyone could have imagined, it what becomes a violent, terrifying fight for truth and survival.
Dead Space launches January 27 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The upcoming Disney-themed free-to-play racer from Gameloft, Disney Speedstorm, came to a screeching halt in December of last year as it was suddenly announced that the game was (unsurprisingly) getting pushed back to 2023. This hasn't stopped the development team from sharing new details about the title however, and their latest reveal is all about the Crew System (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Think of the Spirits model that was used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and you won't be a million miles away. Speedstorm's Crews will let you add extra abilities to your driver and kart by building a team of classic Disney characters before a race each with their own perks.The bonuses granted by this selection can change your kart's top speed, acceleration, handling and boosts amongst other stats, supposedly adding a tactical layer to each race.

We've seen Twitch chat beat games like Pokémon and even The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but how about a more active game? Over the holiday break, Twitch and variety streamer GappyV decided to invent the ultimate test - creating code that converted basic messages into Wii Remote and Nunchuk inputs to see if Twitch chat could "beat" all five games in Wii Sports.
While there were definitely some teething issues, once Twitch chat got the hang of each sport, it was mostly a success. Baseball ended up being the highlight. While it was quite a challenge for chat to get the hang of batting, in the end, it managed to get a home run. You can watch it all unfold in the video above.

We're now at the tail end of Fire Emblem Engage's marketing push - with the game arriving next week, and it seems Nintendo is already turning its attention towards the return of the pink puffball, Kirby.
After the successful release of his first ever 3D platformer in March last year, Nintendo now has Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe locked in for next month. This title originally made its debut on the Wii in 2011 and arrives on Switch on 24th February.

Nintendo dropped an absolutely massive update for Splatoon 3 last November - bumping the game up to Version 2.0.0 and adding new features, improvements and adjustments. It followed with another minor update, so when is the next one?
In case you missed it in the 2.0.0 patch notes, there'll apparently be a balance update rolling out about halfway through Chill Season. Here's exactly what was mentioned at the time: "Our next update is planned for the middle of Chill Season 2022 and should focus on balance adjustments upon analysis of data from the newly added weapons.".

When I hear that a new game is coming based on a popular shonen anime or manga, I tend to assume that we're getting another fighting game that I'll forget about within a week. I can only assume that every Naruto fan is a pro-level arena fighting game player at this point, given the number of Ninja Storm games they've been faced with. One Piece: Burning Blood, Dragon Ball FighterZ, My Hero One's Justice, the ill-fated Jump Force — it seems to me that when you make a game based on a hit anime, the obvious move is to go for a fighting game.
Some of them are good, some of them are not, but boy... are there a lot of them.

      <p>In Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider you might just be the bad guy. You have Metroid-inspired traversal abilities, a Mega Man X sword, and a platter of six levels and bosses to pursue in any order you choose. But are you doing the right thing? The important thing is it feels good to play and is incredibly reminiscent of the 16-bit era of video games in the best way.</p>

A touchdown celebration animation is being removed from Electronic Arts' Madden NFL 23, in light of recent real-world events. The CPR celebration will be taken out of the game, after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field on January 2.
The celebration in question has the scoring player lie down the ground, while their teammates run over and give fake CPR to "revive" them. EA Sports told CBS Sports that celebration will be removed from the game relatively soon.
"EA Sports is taking steps to remove the celebration from Madden NFL 23 via an update in the coming days," a spokesperson told CBS.
Hamlin collapsed on the field during the Bills' game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2. He went into cardiac arrest, and personnel had to perform CPR on Hamlin.
Damar Hamlin has since been discharged from a hospital in Buffalo and will continue rehabilitation at home.

On the field, off the field
This isn't Madden NFL's first time seeing real-world events collide with in-game features. EA removed former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden from Madden NFL 22 in 2021, following his resignation over remarks made in emails. Concussions and brain injuries have also been an ongoing topic for the Madden series, with some games working to address their portrayal of the issue.
And for sports on a grander scale, world politics come into play. Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from games like FIFA and NHL in response to the invasion of Ukraine, in line with its partners at FIFA, UEFA, and the IIHF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ground theme.
"Touch grass" has become the rallying cry for angry people on the internet, and it's most often levelled at gamers. It's shorthand for "go outside", or simply "oh my god the thing you're complaining about is SO TERMINALLY ONLINE that you really should go and do something that isn't sitting at your computer yelling at strangers on the internet". It's sort of like saying "calm down", but much more evocative: We really all should go outside more, shouldn't we?
YouTuber and Twitch streamer j0rts, who appears to be some kind of duck, spends most of his videos doing strange and "mostly pointless things", as he himself puts it. This includes playing Mario Kart with only his eyes, beating Super Mario 64 at 400% speed, and trying to complete the Great Deku Tree dungeon without ever turning left.

As a result of the Poke_Times Twitter account 2023 celebration, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet now have a number of free item codes you can plug right into the game for bonus gifts. While this promotion ends in the middle of the month of January you do have some time to enter them; and the rewards aren't anything wild like a free unique Pokemon.

You have until January 15th at 14:59 UTC to enter these mystery gift codes into Pokemon Scarlet & Violet

If you miss out, it's no big deal. These codes just provide you with a random item from the following table:
x1 Stardust (1,500 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Star Piece (6,000 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Comet Shard (12,500 Pokedollar sell price)
All of these items can be sold to vendors for free Pokedollars (cash). If you need help redeeming them, you can find a full mystery gift walkthrough here. The gist is that you'll need to fully complete the tutorial (to the point where the treasure hunt begins, after the academy portion) to redeem mystery gifts.
After that, you'll be able to acquire them at any time using online distribution methods, as well as codes (like the aforementioned item drops). Enjoy!

Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull and Bones has been delayed yet again, despite already having being delayed for the fifth time last September. It was due for March, but this latest delay pushes it back to "early" in the financial year 2023-24, which begins in July.  
At least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My two favorite things: gaming and sustainability
Microsoft has made it clear over the past few years that they're making an effort to help out the planet, and their newest movement toward their goal of being a "carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste" company takes the form of a brand new update that will impact how Xbox consoles consume power. The update will make Xbox consoles "carbon aware," similar to an update that affected Windows 11 that was released last year.
Upon a one-time download, the new Xbox update will automatically apply changes to the console's settings when it boots up. Major changes include consoles updating automatically to the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which means power consumption will be reduced while the console is turned off. This setting will cause the console to boot more slowly, but it will save 20x the amount of energy while active, Microsoft says. In addition, the Xbox will not wake at its usual nightly hours of 2-6am for maintenance, and will instead wake to perform updates at any time that uses the most renewable energy.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1613219312709554176
Of course, these settings are entirely optional, and players can turn them off any time they choose. The aforementioned updates will be automatically applied for Xbox Insiders as of today, but Microsoft did include instructions for non-Insiders to implement these changes on their own when they become available in the future. For a full breakdown of these instructions and details of the entire carbon aware update, check out this post on the official Xbox blog.

Square Enix has announced that it will be unveiling yet another mobile release set within the world of the iconic franchise Dragon Quest. The as-yet-unannounced title will be showcased in a special event held on Wednesday, January 18.
While no further details were revealed at this early stage, a new teaser website and Twitter channel have been launched in Japan. According to Gematsu, the new title will be an RPG, and next week's event will feature a gameplay overview along with a new trailer and further release details. The live stream will take place on the official Square Enix Japan YouTube channel, January 18, at 19:00 JST / 02:00 PT / 11:00 BST.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3QzqFt620&ab_channel=%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9
This release will be the latest in a long, long line of Dragon Quest titles released for mobile devices. These games have ranged from rereleases of Dragon Quest classics, to an abundance of free-to-play RPGs, monster trainers, and geolocation titles. Many of these modern releases have ended service within two-to-three years of launch. The most recent release in this medium, Dragon Quest Tact, launched in North America in January 2021 and remains currently operational.
We'll soon find out whether this new release is a full premium RPG or another flash-in-the-pan F2P title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The OG Zelda game like we've never seen it before
Of all the games to be modded into VR, the original Legend of Zelda game was near the bottom of my list in terms of expectations. Usually when a game goes VR, it's already got a 3D art style, but I have to admit adding a whole new dimension to a title, especially such a classic one, is a really intriguing idea. Now we get a chance to see what that experience is like, because Japanese modder and retro gaming enthusiast Sugar Noe posted a video of themselves playing The Legend of Zelda to both Twitter and YouTube, as originally reported by Nintendo Life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vNA8-UE780
In 2021, a user named DeTwelve created a mod called The Legend of Doom, which faithfully recreates The Legend of Zelda in the engine of the original Doom. Then Sugar Noe took that mod and made their own tweaks so that it would be playable on a Quest VR headset. This thing has layers, but the final result has to make for one of the most immersive Zelda experiences ever.
I played through The Legend of Zelda with a friend a few years ago on his SNES Classic, but admittedly I wasn't too intrigued considering how much the game showed its age, if you can pardon my blasphemy. We never finished it, but I will say that the added twist of playing it in VR might just be the push I need to get the very first Zelda game under my belt once and for all.

Okay, hands up — who watched the 1989 The Legend of Zelda cartoon growing up?

Now Polygon has published interviews with many of the writers, voice actors, and creators of the show which reveal many behind-the-scenes secrets.
Published as part of Polygon's Zeldathon, the publication's year-long celebration of all things Zelda in anticipation of Tears of the Kingdom's release on 12th May, the article shares many of the show's creators' thoughts and reflections on the now-infamous cartoon. The 13-episode-long show aired during the Friday slot of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, but only lasted for one season.

Bandai Namco has released a new gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming RPG Tales of Symphonia Remastered, which will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on February 17.
The epic anime adventure, a remix of the 2003 Nintendo GameCube classic, tells a typical tale of a mysterious "Chosen One" who is prophesized to one day rise up from the people and save the land from impending doom. And when that doom finally arrives in the form of parallel worlds Sylvarant and Tethe'alla, young hero Lloyd Irving realizes that doing the right thing doesn't always work both ways...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2mYyeIPbo&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
The new remaster features a variety of aesthetic and technical overhauls, including enhanced graphics, a modernized control system, retweaked balance, and a variety of additional features to further polish the beloved GameCube adventure. Tales of Symphonia Remastered supports up to four players in co-op action, as you and your energetic party travel the lands, battle beasties, and attempt to alter the fate of not one, but two worlds and the people that reside within them.
If you're too young for the original title, or you simply never got around to checking it out, then this new remaster will offer a fresh opportunity. Held in very high regard by both critics and players of its time, this anime escaped will be worth a peek for anybody with a fondness for the classic approach to adventure gaming.
Tales of Symphonia Remastered launches February 17 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

At the end of 2022, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy PIxel Remaster, a collection composed of revamped versions of Final Fantasy I through VI, would finally be making its way to Nintendo Switch, putting to rest many months of speculation from eager fans. It’s big news, as its release means that FF-loving Switch owners will soon be able to enjoy every mainline Final Fantasy game from the very beginning of the series all the way to the 12th entry, minus MMOPRG Final Fantasy XI.
Aside from the mainline series, Switch owners can also currently access a number of spin-offs, including the likes of the recently released Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, World of Final Fantasy MAXIMA, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, and Chocobo GP. Needless to say, there’s plenty of choice on the Switch if you’re a fan of Square Enix’s flagship franchise, and the introduction of the Pixel Remaster compilation in 2023 begs the question: What’s next for Final Fantasy on the Switch?

Ubisoft is making more big shifts to its future plans. The company announced today that it is cancelling three more unannounced games, pushing Skull and Bones further back, and is planning a cost reduction of more than €200 million over the next two years.
The shift to Ubisoft's future plans was announced today, and the publisher attributes the shift to several factors. Two of Ubisoft's 2022 titles, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023, underperformed. And Ubisoft also cites worsening macroeconomic conditions as a factor in its new plans.
"We are clearly disappointed by our recent performance," said CEO Yves Guillemot. "We are facing contrasted market dynamics as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and everla…]]></summary>

Even in games that get a ton of continued support after launch, like Stardew Valley, which also happens to be one of my most played and loved games of all time, it's inevitable to encounter a glitch every now and again.

Tribute Games' radical throwback brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge has made a surprise arrival on mobile platforms — But while the Heroes in a Half-Shell are now readily available to download on Android and iOS platforms, the game itself is only accessible to Netflix subscribers.
It would appear that the 2022 scrapper, a love letter to the TMNT arcade titles of yore, is the newest release in the burgeoning Netflix Games division, and as such requires a Netflix sub to play the title at all. One would assume that this also applies to online modes of Shredder's Revenge, so hopefully you have three pals all subbed to the streaming service if you want some handheld multiplayer action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcaEQVBcY0&ab_channel=Netflix
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge sees the fab four team with Channel 9 reporter April O'Neil, sensei Master Splinter, and sporting goods vigilante Casey Jones on a mission to stop The Shredder and his Foot Clan from taking over The Big Apple. The game features a huge variety of cameos and references to Eastman and Laird's iconic 1987 TV series — including appearances from Bebop & Rocksteady, The Rat King, Irma, Vernon, and the Teenagers from Dimension X.
The mobile port is not currently in parity with the PC and console releases, sitting just one update behind. So while not all of the game's bugs and issues have been ironed out for the mobile port, the majority of features and modes are all present and ready to rock. For our thoughts on the original release, check out our full review right here.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Bayonetta 3 came and conquered, but Platinum Games has been infrequently tweaking the game since its October 2022 release.

So there's a few things this patch addresses:
Combat adjustments that mainly apply to Viola
Nerfs to many Niflheim challenge stages (which a lot of people asked for, even on higher-end difficulties)
The Tricolored Keys/Old Picture Book secret is easier to access, as you just get the Tricolored Keys automatically now

Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

Several months ago we learned that Return to Dream Land is coming to the Switch in 2023 as Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and we haven't heard much about it since. That changes today, as we have new copy ability reveals: the best kind of Kirby reveals.
The announcement come by way of two tweets, both of which are from the Nintendo UK account. The first one confirms "Sand," a new copy ability coming to Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, which allows Kirby to "shift sand into a variety of shapes, from a fist to a castle, and take on even the toughest foes." So like the Spider-Man villain Sandman? That sounds rad. The other is actually a returning copy ability that hails from Kirby Star Allies. It's none other than "Festival," which is a dancing-based ability that's kind of like an ultimate (think screen-freezing mass damage).

I'm ready to return to Dream Land
It's crazy to think that 11 years later this game is making a grand return, but I couldn't be happier. Return to Dream Land Deluxe deserves a bigger spotlight, and it'll get it on the Switch: which has its massive (and growing) install base. Also, to be frank, it'll be easier to replay it on the Switch (though I still have my Wii U [which I use!] hooked up out of respect [and to play old Wii games!]).

The retro-inspired market went from novel to heavily saturated rather quickly, and now they’ve been their own corner of the industry for over a decade. It’s a rather difficult corner to stand out in. It’s a pretty busy corner.
For my money, it’s a precarious balancing act between building off designs and mechanics of the era, while also finding a memorable identity. You can make Contra again, and if you do a good job, that can be good enough. But you can’t stand with the big boys unless you bring your own pants. Or something. I sometimes just hork up analogies and hope they make sense.
With Oniken, Odallus, and Blazing Chrome under their belt, JoyMasher has tried on a few pairs of pants in their years. Really, though, those games harken rather heavily toward their influences.  …]]></summary>

Case in point: Goldhawk Interactive's long-awaited Xenonauts 2 has just been confirmed to be heading to Steam early access later this year. Huzzah! The original Xenonauts was an excellent homage to the hyphenated school of X-COMs / UFO: Enemy Unknowns of old, so I'm feeling pretty pumped to find out how its sequel builds on its classic, squad-based tactics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['I guess we really are The Last of Us Part I'
Following a frankly obnoxious amount of media build-up and endless think-pieces, HBO finally previewed its live-action adaptation of The Last of Us to an army of critics, who have been overwhelmingly positive in their response to the grim-looking televisual take of the hit game series.
The new series currently sits at an incredible 97% on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, with a score calculated from a total of 60 media reviews. The long-in-development series, which will debut on the HBO network next week, sees beleaguered protagonists Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) pick their way through a dilapidated shell of the United States, attempting to stay one step ahead of thieving marauders and the terrifying mutated humans known as "Clickers."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax
The HBO TV adaptation was first announced back in 2020, a seemingly snug fit for a game series so beholden to its distinct cinematic style. The show is produced by a litany of companies including Sony Pictures, Word Games, Naughty Dog, and the recently founded PlayStation Productions. The show itself is written by Craig Mazin, the Emmy award-winning creator of equally grim series Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the writer of the video game iterations of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.
If you're looking forward to the new show, then you won't have too much longer to wait. The first episode will air this Sunday, January 15, on HBO and HBO Max. In the UK, The Last of Us will air at 02:00 BST on Monday mornings via Sky Atlantic and NOW TV, to coincide with the U.S. timeslot. Don't fret staying up, as each episode will be made available on demand after its respective premiere.
We're about to hit a whole new wave of Last of Us discourse, folks. Batten down the fuckin' hatches.

Every breathtaking thing down there, from jellyfish to giant squids to killer whales, either wants to kill you (see killer whales) or is so frigidly indifferent to human existence that it might as well want you dead. After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

Last month, it was reported that workers at Activision Blizzard support studio Proletariat had taken steps to forming its own union, working in conjunction with the Communication Workers of America (CWA) to establish the Proletariat Workers Alliance. However, it seems that leadership at both Activision Blizzard and Proletariat itself are refusing to recognize the group on a voluntarily basis.
In a blog post signed by "The Proletariat Leadership Team", management states that rather than acknowledge the PWA, it instead wishes to hold a new, company-wide, anonymous vote, filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). This NLRB vote, writes leadership "allows employees to get all the information and various points of view. This is an important decision, everyo…]]></summary>

Aaron Swartz založil Demand Progress, spolupracoval na projektech Open Library, Internet Archive a Reddit. Ve svých čtrnácti se podílel na specifikaci RSS 1.0. Vytvořil webový framework web.py, pracoval na tor2web a rozšíření HTTPS Everywhere pro Chrome. Stál u zrodu licence Creative Commons. Aaronovi Swartzovi hrozilo 35 let vězení a pokuta milion dolarů za hromadné stahování vědeckých článků z webu JSTOR. Dle přátel i vlastních výpovědí několik posledních let trpěl depresemi. V pátek 11. ledna 2013 ukončil svůj život oběšením.]]></summary>

Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod.

So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platforming adventure Animal Well has been picked up by Bigmode, the indie publishing company set up last year by YouTuber Videogamedunkey. The Metroidvania is being developed by Shared Memories, another name for solo dev Billy Basso. Basso is crafting a multi-layered puzzle horror platformer that he hopes will keep people playing the game for years, and collaborating to solve its mysteries. You can see a bit more of what to expect from Animal Well in the preview video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Echo by Shelter developers Might and Delight is a real hidden gem. It’s very in line with what the studio is known for - creating beautiful handcrafted worlds complete with stories about nature - but with Tiny Echo, instead of making an animal game featuring a group of cute critters trying to survive the brutal wilderness (and that most likely made you cry), the Stockholm team went completely left-field and created a bite-sized ethereal puzzler that deals with ghosts and spirits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s only a few weeks until EA Motive’s reimagining of the original Dead Space stalks onto PC, but anyone pre-ordering the game on Steam will also nab a copy of Dead Space 2. This seems to be exclusive to Valve’s storefront, as the Epic Games Store isn’t listing the offer on their pre-order page for the Dead Space remake. Oh, and even though Dead Space 2’s been available for more than a decade you’ll have to wait until the Dead Space remake goes live to play your complimentary copy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amidst the fanciful flying cars and smart dog collars of CES 2023, Sony used their time at the Las Vegas technology show to announce Project Leonardo: a highly adaptive PS5 controller kit designed, much like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, to make it easier for people with disabilities to play games. Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

It's a concerning development for voice actors, as well as anyone who could be duped into thinking they're on the phone with a relative who desperately needs their card details. I'm usually struck by the impressiveness of new AI tricks before I think about their negative implications, but I found this unsettling from the off.

We've seen them confuse bakery staff, and amuse the guy behind a counter at a convenience store. Now, we get to see them perform an ABBA parody celebrating sandwiches. The Sniper plays banjo, and the Pyro's contributions are soul warming. Enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try not to bang on about it, but in the interests of transparency, it's important to stress how much I loathe most soulslikes. Even the name, to be frank. So when I say that I don't love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it's not as damning as it may sound.
You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I knew Minecraft had an ending, but I didn't know that ending consists of an unskippable 9 minute long poem. I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was "a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films", which just - you know what, I'm going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.

Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place.

      <p>Fall Guys is becoming&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em> with the arrival of skins from the acclaimed&nbsp;animated series this week.</p>

<p>With season 2 of <em>Invincible</em> set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Koch gave PayDay 3 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/19/payday-3-release-set-for-2023-with-new-publishing-deal-18-month-post-launch-support" target="_blank">a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021</a>, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/10/koch-media-shows-off-gungrave-gore-painkiller-and-slate-of-new-ips" target="_blank">PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting</a>. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/payday-3-official-reveal-trailer" target="_blank"><em>IGN</em></a> revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1VvQ9-50Fg" width=""></iframe>

<p>As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.</p>

<p>It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/01/what-i-learned-designing-my-thesis-game">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>2023 means a new year, new everything! That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022. Hopefully, with 365 chances to make a splash, one of the following titles from my personal wish list will make a big comeback after spending a year in relative silence. </p>

      <p class="firstgraph">In October 2001, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto III – and the entire pop-culture paradigm shifted. It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.</p>

<p>To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/19/20-years-of-liberty-city">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>You could walk past this section of sidewalk a million times and not think about it once. It’s a 15-foot patch of concrete the same as the 15 feet ahead of you and the 15 feet behind you. No different than the 100 feet beyond that. It’s nothing.</p>

<p>Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.</p>

<p>I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/back-alleys-and-side-streets">Read more...</a></p>]]></summary>

      <p>Game delays are a part of life. You know the old saying, a delayed game is…well, you know. It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.</p>

<p>Courtesy of <em>IGN</em>, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
