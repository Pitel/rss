        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, a free-to-play battle royale coming to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. 
This new battle royale set in the universe of the popular manga-turned-anime My Hero Academia was announced in the latest issue of Weekly Jump, a Japanese magazine, as reported by Gematsu. All that we can glean of the game so far is what’s shown in Weekly Jump, which Gematsu has two screenshots of, so be sure to check out that report for some more details in Japanese and multiple in-game screenshots. 
“Team up to win a 24-player rumble in multiplayer action,” the magazine reads. 
According to the reveal, Bandai Namco has plans for a closed beta test for My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, which is not unusual for battle royales or free-to-play games for that matter. As for who to expect in the game, we see All-Might, Shoto Todoroki, Katsuki Bakugo, and of course, Izuku Midoriya. 
As for where this game falls narratively, that’s anybody’s guess although eagle-eyed fans might spot some giveaways that place it after certain events in the show. We won’t spoil any events here because you should either watch or read the very good My Hero Academia. 
Interestingly, Gematsu credits someone on Twitter as finding this magazine announcement but if you look for that tweet, it’s been deleted. Perhaps this Weekly Jump magazine wasn’t out yet and that person got an early copy of it or something; only time will tell. For now, My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble does not have a release date, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled for one. 
For more about this franchise, read about how Legendary Entertainment is giving My Hero Academia the live-action adaptation treatment. Check out our thoughts on My Hero One’s Justice after that.

The game has won its share of fans over the years since its launch, and the new content promises to send players on a planet-hopping, story-driven quest to uncover the secrets behind strange extraterrestrial lifeforms. As such, veteran players and would-be fans may be looking at this latest console release as a jumping-in point. Unfortunately, players may find the interstellar game doesn’t fly smoothly on Switch.
System Era Softworks is the development team behind this sci-fi adventure, and it counts amongst its crew experienced industry creators from places like 343 Industries, Valve, and EA. Astroneer allows players to hop into the spacesuit of an intergalactic …]]></summary>

Five years ago today Nintendo pulled the curtain back on Switch with an online presentation and hands-on events for the games media, and anyone else lucky enough to nab a press pass. It was our first chance to go hands-on with Switch ahead of its March 2017 launch and many of us at Nintendo Life — and others across the press — have been reminiscing and recalling our impressions of that first event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In space, no one can hear you scrap.
The story of Astroneer is a remarkable one, and one this reviewer (hello!) has been following since the very beginning. Back in 2015, this charming little teaser trailer was released, showing a spaceman traversing lonely, low-poly alien landscapes. It wasn't fully clear what the game was, but it was instantly appealing nonetheless, and when the game came out in 2016 in Early Access, its Minecraft-meets-No Man's Sky sandbox charmed the spacepants off its players.
Seven years later, Astroneer is finally landing on what is arguably a perfect platform for it: The Nintendo Switch. Some games are so well-suited to the portable handheld experience that you hope against all odds that it will be ported over, even though the game is several years old; this time, those hopes actually paid off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set sail for the Land of Rin next month.
Stegosoft's Chrono Trigger-esque Rise of the Third Power was first announced back in 2018 and, with a demo released exclusively on Steam last year, we weren't entirely sure whether or not it was destined for a Switch release.
However, a new eShop listing for the game has now confirmed that it will indeed hit Nintendo's console, arriving on 10th February priced at £17.99/$19.99/€19.99. The game, which is a follow-up to Stegosoft's WW1-inspired Ara Fell, sees a party of eight heroes fight to survive as they battle across the Land of Rin in order to topple an evil emperor, all while the clock ticks down towards "the reprise of the greatest war in human history", which we're assuming means some sort of alternate universe World War 2 is on the cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's probably more trouble than it's worth to sidestep around comparisons to Mount & Blade with Sands Of Salzaar. It's mostly the structure. Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You'll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you'll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.
It's no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio co-founded by former Valve writer Chet Faliszek and former Riot designer Kimberly Voll have released The Anacrusis into early access today, a Left 4 Dead-like set in 70s space. Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.
Yes, it's still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am ecstatic to see the game come to Nintendo Switch".
The Legend of Zelda inspires a lot of game makers, and sometimes that is very much worn on the creator's sleeve. Ocean's Heart is one such title that doesn't hide the fact that it's trying to give its own spin on Nintendo's iconic franchise, with developer Max Mraz now teaming up with Nordcurrent to bring the game to Switch - it arrives on 10th February priced at $14.99/€14.99/£13.49.
As you can see in the trailer it adopts a pixelated top down approach, albeit with a take on Link's now iconic blue garb from Breath of the Wild.

In the latest update via social media, Square Enix focuses on the karts in the game and how there'll be three different types of vehicles available. The three types will include standard model, grip model, and speed model - and each one has different stats. There also appears to be some cosmetic differences:

You don’t know how Earth fell apart in the first place, though, so you’ll brave the environment to uncover artifacts and resources hinting at its demise. Finding ways to grow food and craft tools is also vital. The world’s ecosystem has changed dramatically though, so who knows what dangers you'll find hidden beneath the clouds. 
An airbase serves as your floating headquarters. It can be customized to your liking, and you’ll use it as a laboratory, home, and workshop. You also appear to have a variety of tools at your disposal. The trailer shows off a wrist-mounted laser that vaporizes objects, such as a door to access a new area. Forever Skies will begin life as a single-player game, but Far From Home plans to add a co-op mode during its Early Access lifecycle.

Far From Home plans to launch Forever Skies in Early Access sometime this year. Though it will be available first on PC, the team plans to release the game on consoles, of which PlayStation 5 is confirmed, at a later date.

NIS America's beautiful storybook game, The Cruel King and the Great Hero, is due out at the start of March — the 1st in North America, and the 4th in Europe — and to hype up the game, they've just released a new music video for the track 'Txilrcka'.
The Cruel King and the Great Hero is a 2D side-scrolling role-playing game from director Sayaka Oda, who also helmed the team behind 2019's The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince, a game that was as pretty to look at as it was boring to play, according to our review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A trailer for Amazon Prime Video’s upcoming Critical Role series, The Legend of Vox Machina, has been released alongside new details about the upcoming animated show. 
Amazon released a new Vox Machina trailer today and you can view the standard version below. However, if you’re looking for something more at home with the ramblings of the Critical Role cast that happen on Thursday nights, you might want to check out the red band version of this trailer, which features more gore and no beeps over Vox Machina’s more choice words. 
Click here to watch embedded media


It was revealed today by Variety that The Legend of Vox Machina will be released as a trio of episodes every week, for four weeks, starting on Friday, January 28. In a little over two weeks, the first three episodes will hit Amazon’s Prime Video subscription streaming service, and then the following Friday, another three episodes will be released and so on until the 12-episode Season 1 comes to an end. Don’t sweat, though – a second season has already been greenlit following massive Kickstarter success for this series. That same Kickstarter success also extended the first season from 10 episodes to 12. 
For the uninitiated, The Legend of Vox Machina is an animated series based on the first Critical Role D&D campaign that ran from 2015 to 2017. Like the D&D story it’s based on, the animated series sees Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Liam O’Brien, Marisha Ray, Matthew Mercer, Sam Riegel, Taliesin Jaffe, and Travis Willingham return to their roles. These eight Critical Role voice actors are also executive producing the series alongside Brandon Auman (Star Wars: Resistance) and Chris Prynoski (Metalocaypse). 
For more about Critical Role, check out these two statues released last year and then watch The Legend of Vox Machina red band trailer after that.

That's the mysterious pitch for Summertime Madness, a puzzle game with gorgeous visuals that's making its way to the Nintendo Switch this month. As the artist, you'll have to figure out Myst-like environmental puzzles to make your way back home.

Capcom's latest lizard-skinning simulator is a good'un, and what we played of it pre-release seemed like a solid PC port. However, now the game is out in the world, some would-be players are being blocked out by a bug which doesn't let them even start a new save. Still, the majority of folks seem to be quite happily hollowing out dogs to make slippers.

Monster Hunter: World was an important paradigm shift for Capcom’s beloved franchise. The well-paced difficulty ramp made progression enjoyable for newcomers, while countless endgame challenges kept expert hunters coming back for more. Monster Hunter Rise’s gameplay often attempts to copy World’s success, which isn’t always a bad thing. Battles continue to be an exhilarating dance with death, gear customization is satisfying, and coordinating hunts with friends makes for awesome fun and unexpected outcomes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free up some (mush)room for this gem.
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is one of those wildly underrated Nintendo games that tends to go forgotten — perhaps because its announcement at E3 in 2014 was overshadowed by Splatoon, Smash Bros., Xenoblade Chronicles X, Bayonetta 2, and what would eventually become Breath of the Wild, but perhaps because its mini-platforming levels seemed a little simple for a full-price release... or because almost no one had a Wii U to play it on in the first place.
Whatever the reason people missed out on it, that can now be remedied: It's available for free, for those of you with a Nintendo Switch Online membership (in North America)! From the 13th to the 20th of January, you can download the game for free to give it a try, and if you decide to buy it, it will also be 30% off from today until the 16th of January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So many have arrived, but we can still dream.
As soon as the Switch was revealed, attention swiftly turned to "ooh, do you think this and that game will be on it, I want to play that one while riding in a hot air balloon / sitting in a park / on the loo". Since that day dreams have been fulfilled as some iconic games have been available in portable form, with the most recent announcement (at the time of writing) being Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection.
Over the winter holidays we generally run an annual list of games we'd be ecstatically pleased to (re)play on Switch, and the announcement of Assassin's Creed II — one of our very favourite games in that series — finally coming to Switch had us reminiscing about the games we've dared to dream might get a Switch port in the past. Our hybrid wishlists have been fulfilled from right across the industry, from major triple-A titles like The Witcher 3, Dark Souls and Bioshock: The Collection through to Indie classics beyond count. The little system has even answered the ultimate gamers' question — can it run Crysis? Yes, yes it can.

2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series! Please look forward to a variety of #Kirby30 activities coming soon. pic.twitter.com/BZO1rz4LwC
January 12, 2022
The Kirby Twitter account posted about the milestone this morning. The tweet reads, "2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series! Please look forward to a variety of #Kirby30 activities coming soon." A prior tweet actually announced the anniversary in Japanese and shared a link to a "teaser site" with commemorative wallpapers to celebrate the occasion. A rough translation of the tweet states there may be other "goods and campaigns" coming down the line. For now, the adorable wallpapers are a great way to start Kirby's year.
Kirby's Dreamland was released in 1992 for the Game Boy, soon after becoming one of the must-have games for the handheld system, at least for me. Its easygoing platforming and whimsical stages and characters set the stage for Kirby's subsequent adventures on the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and so on. Here's a fun fact about the first game: its Japanese title, Hoshi no Kirby, translates to "Kirby of the Stars," which explains the absorbent hero's penchant for riding and coughing up stars.
What do you want to see from the Kirby 30th anniversary? Are there any lost or forgotten Kirby adventures you'd like to see collected for Switch or elsewhere? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The fabled SNES emulator known as SNESticle, which for much of the past two decades was considered to be nothing more than a rumour, has finally been unearthed and excavated by a Swedish programmer using, of all things, a National Security Agency-designed open source tool.
SNESticle, the follow-up to Icer Addis' legendary NESticle emulator - a follow-up the ex-EA employee long denied even existed - was found buried in code for the GameCube version of 2005's Fight Night Round 2, where it was being used to enable gamers to unlock a playable version of Super Punch-Out!!

On the PS5, NBA 2K22 was the number one most-downloaded PS5 game in the U.S. and Canada in 2021 while in Europe, unsurprisingly, FIFA 22 took the top spot. Call of Duty: Vanguard was the number two game in both regions, which, while not necessarily surprising because Call of Duty games always sell well, it’s pretty wild that a game released in November was the number two most-downloaded game of the entire year. 
Along those same lines, Among Us was the number six most-downloaded game of 2021 in the EU, despite releasing in December.

For many of our friends in the US, Nintendo Power magazine was the way to get all the latest news, guides and more relating to the latest Nintendo games. Kicking off in 1988 and running for 24 years, the magazine was known for its official ties to Nintendo – it was originally designed and created in-house, after all – and was immensely popular among fans until it was eventually shut down in 2012.
Of course, Nintendo Power has since been revived as a podcast, but those of you who crave the glory days of the original magazine will want to check out this upcoming live stream. Hosted by The Video Game History Foundation, the 'Nintendo Power Reunion' will bring together some of the mag's original staff to talk about their time working on the project for the first time.

They're able to sprint and slide around maps at blistering speeds, which might seem at odds with the game's tactical pace, but they fit into the roster nicely. Thing is, you've got to be brave enough to get the most out of their move set, which rewards ballsy plays over careful corner turns. It's safe to say I struggled to break out of my tentative shell, but when I did? Hoo boy, what a thrill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl has been delayed to December 8. This news comes from developer GSC Game World on Twitter, who states they need more time to fulfill its vision of the game. The long-awaited sequel was previously scheduled to launch on April 28.
GSC’s message reads as follows:
Fans have been waiting for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 since it was first revealed in 2010. The game has had a tumultuous development history, including being canceled and restarted, not to mention some developer/investor drama. The first-person shooter sees players exploring the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to battle mutants, engage with factions, and more in a non-linear narrative. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 found itself embroiled in controversy last month when GSC announced plans to put real players in the game as NPCs…but as paid NFTs. Fans quickly revolted, which saw GSC first respond by standing its ground and defending the concept before reversing course and canceling all NFT plans just minutes later. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is slated to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that we've still only seen scraps of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 after years of development and with launch supposedly mere months away, I suppose it's not a surprise to hear the game is delayed. The developers, GSC Game World today announced that they've pushed the launch back by seven months, giving the first-person explore-o-shooter a new release date of the 8th of December. It's the usual perfectly sensible reason: they want it to be good, and they think it needs more time to be good.

SNK has been bringing a variety of NEOGEO Pocket Color titles to the Switch, and the latest arrival is live now on the eShop in North America and Europe (hat-tip to Nintendo Everything for the spot). SNK VS. Capcom: Card Fighters' Clash is available now for $7.99 / €7,99 / £7.19, bringing together what was two separate editions in the original release of 1999.
As the name makes clear back in the day this had a Pokémon-style release of two versions, with each one having some unique decks and cards. In this version you have both versions of the game, four versions if you consider that it has the English and Japanese builds. Each iteration has its own save data, and you can trade and even battle between the two versions (of the same language) in the game.

The answer: pretty well! Like previous marquee Sony port Horizon Zero Dawn, this is a game that already looked lovely on console, and the extra muscle of even a modest PC rig can deliver sizeable boosts to both visual quality and frames-per-second.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the eight year gap between 2010's more conventional sexy gore fest God Of War 3 and this new and improved action-dadventure God Of War, the angry Ancient Greek warboy Kratos handed in his god-killing badge and gun to live in Norse mythology's woods with his wife Faye and their son Atreus. When Faye dies, Kratos & Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that'll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.
I played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it's actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.

They disappear in seconds any time they go live online and finding one on store shelves feels as rare as winning the lottery. A new report from Bloomberg says that in order to deal with this shortage, Sony is producing more PlayStation 4 consoles. 
The publication reports that as Sony anticipates 2022 to be another year where the supply of PS5s struggles to keep up with the demand for the new-gen console, it’s ramping up production of the PS4. Despite what some might have thought, Sony said it did not have plans to end production on the PS4, although rumors said 2021 would be its last year.

For example, today only, you can visit Snowpoint City to witness a fun and classic easter egg. Back in the original Gen IV games, if you visited Snowpoint City on January 12, you’d see “diamond dust” fall all over the town. While the game doesn’t necessarily point it out, it’s an easter egg that nods to Pokémon director and composer, Junichi Masuda, as noted by Eurogamer. You can see the diamond dust in Serebii’s Joe Merrick’s video on Twitter below:

After Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take 500 hours to fully complete the game over the weekend, the internet's collective groan over the revelation was reportedly heard from the far reaches of space. Personally, I think it's a preposterous figure for a single-player game, but as someone who also maintains an active spreadsheet of all my various playtime stats (yes, really), it also got me thinking. Is 500 hours really so nonsensical in the grand scheme of things? I asked the team what their most played game on Steam is to find out. 
And as it turns out, Dying Light 2's 500 hour completion time ain't got nothing on some of our favourite time hogs...

        <updated>2022-01-11T21:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last few years have seen Bidoof emerge as one of the more popular Pokémon in the fandom. Not so much because The Pokémon Company has rolled out the red carpet of marketing for it as often as it does for Pikachu and Eevee. Nay, it has largely been fans that have willed Bidoof to the stratosphere thanks to a plethora of cute memes and tributes. The Pokémon Company is leaning into this movement, releasing a charming animated short called Bidoof’s Big Stand.
The eight-minute story stars a cowardly and accident-prone Bidoof who just can’t seem to do anything right, much to the chagrin of its fellow Bidoof and other wild Pokémon. It’s not until a chance meeting with a human trainer that it realizes its true potential. If you proudly identify as a Bidoof stan or simply need a cheerful pick-me-up, Bidoof's Big Stand offers a cute and humourous tip of the cap to the beaver-like critter.

If the animation has you pining to capture a Bidoof of your own, you're in luck! You can find plenty of them roaming the Sinnoh region in the recently released Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. With any luck, we’ll also bump into a Hisiuan version in the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Arceus.]]></summary>

The collection, which was originally released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016, features the Italian Renaissance trilogy starring the aforementioned Ezio Auditore. Included in the package are Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and Assassin's Creed Revelations, all with enhanced visuals and now Switch-specific features. Other than the apparent new portability of these games, developer Virtuous has added support for HD Rumble, a touch screen interface, and an optimized HUD.

Check out the trailer above to see how the second generation of Assassin's Creed translates to the Switch. If it's looking like an offer you can't refuse, it'll only set you back $39.99. Otherwise, grab The Ezio Collection on PlayStation or Xbox if you can't wait a few weeks.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Lego has delayed the upcoming release of its Lego Overwatch 2 Titan set as a result of the ongoing Activision Blizzard controversy. 
This news comes by way of TheBrickFan, which reports that Lego is pausing the release of the set in order to review its partnership with Activision Blizzard in light of allegations against the company and leadership within. The latest of said controversy was revealed back in December when a current Blizzard employee said in a press conference that she was demoted after filing an HR complaint about sexual harassment. Here’s Lego’s official statement regarding the indefinite delay:
This decision by Lego must have come in the final hour because the Overwatch 2 Titan set was due out very soon. With less than three weeks to go, it wouldn’t be surprising if these boxes were already being sent to retailers before today. 
There’s no word on when this set will be released or when Lego’s review of its partnership with Activision Blizzard will be complete.

        <updated>2022-01-11T17:48:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie revealed way back in 2020 that Savathûn, the sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King, would be getting her own expansion and last year, the studio revealed that our guardians would be taking on The Witch Queen come February. 
With February 22 right around the corner, Bungie’s marketing for the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion has been ramping up and today, the company released a trailer all about the new exploration area in it: Savathûn’s Throne World. As seen in other trailers, Savathûn is a big fan of anything with a dark hue of green and her throne world is no different. However, all is not as it seems there as Savathûn considers the area to essentially be an extension of her mind.

“Tell me, oh honored guest,” Savathûn says in the trailer. “Why would you want to escape? This Throne World is indistinguishable from my own mind, Guardian. Every step taken, every bullet fired, I keep and count them all. It’s not too late to turn around.” 
That’s not foreboding at all…
As you can see in the trailer above, the Throne World looks quite unique compared to other places we’ve visited in Destiny 2, with a distinct horror feel to it all. It also looks quite diverse, too, which is exciting. The trailer’s description mentions Savathûn’s “glistening palace” and “gnarled roots in the swamp” so it sounds like there’s a journey ahead of us before actually reaching Savathûn’s Throne. 
We’ll all learn more when The Witch Queen hits Destiny 2 on February 22. 
While waiting for this expansion, check out Game Informer’s Lore Refresher on Savathûn and then read about how you’ll need need the digital deluxe edition of The Witch Queen to play through its dungeons, less you want to purchase them separately. Watch this narrative-focused trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen released back in December after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far: Changing Tides, the sequel to 2018’s Far: Lone Sails, has secured a release date, and it’s not too far (eh?) away. The meditative post-apocalyptic adventure sets sail on March 1. 
Like its predecessor, Changing Tides tasks players with piloting and maintaining a large makeshift vessel, this time to explore a flooded world. Along the way, you’ll explore underwater cities and other vestiges of humanity while solving environmental puzzles in the ship or on foot. The adolescent protagonist can dive beneath the surface to recover scrap and other materials as well. Like in the first game, don’t be surprised if you grow attached to your ship as you constantly tinker with it in order to overcome new obstacles. A new release date trailer offers a fresh, albeit brief, look at what’s in store.

Ross spoke rather freely with FTW about his philosophies of creating games, stories from the creation of Days Gone, and what he felt went right and wrong with the project. He also spoke about iteration in games, which he was hoping to do in a potential sequel to the open-world zombie/biker adventure. Comparing Days Gone to other popular franchises, Ross points out how the Batman: Arkham series or Uncharted build upon the ideas and features as the installments go on. "So you create the minimum viable entry and then hope you get to build the second one," Ross says, "Because you’re…]]></summary>

If you’re playing solo or with one other friend, launching into a match is much easier than launching into one with a larger squad. If you fall into the latter camp, there’s a good chance you can’t even get into a match proper and while 343 Industries attempted to get this issue mitigated before the studio’s holiday break, it wasn’t able to get it completely fixed. According to a new post-holiday break Halo Infinite blog post, a fix is coming soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The director of Moon and Warcraft is still dreaming of making a movie version of Full Throttle, the classic LucasArts adventure game about rough 'n' tough bikers and lovers. A year ago Duncan Jones released a tentative script he banged out in a fit of procrastination, and in 2022 he's still thinking of the smell of asphalt. In a cheeky wee tweet over the weekend, he asked fans to bug LucasOwners Disney to let him do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Giant sprawling MMORPGs are a rarity these days compared to when it seemed like new options were available for players every week. Lost Ark has already had success in other regions, but the title will finally see a launch in North America next month after many years. In a nutshell, Lost Ark has a ton of features and mechanics that you’d expect in a traditional MMORPG like dungeons, raids, loot, crafting, home building, and more. So what’s the hook? It’s all tied together with stylish action combat, more akin to what you’d find in a modern ARPG like Diablo, Path of Exile, or Torchlight. Check out the trailer below to get a taste of what you can expect!

With various character classes to suit most traditional archetypes and years and years of content already online in other territories, Lost Ark has a blueprint for launching heavy and hard come February 11 on PC. We’ll have to see exactly what choices Amazon Games has made to many systems, especially monetization, but we won’t have long to wait. Are you looking forward to Lost Ark?

While the studio likely thought this was good messaging to showcase just how much content is in its branching-narrative story, the announcement was met with some backlash amidst the excitement, as some players bemoaned the length and worried about bloat or that they would never see the end of such a massive adventure.
Later, as the studio saw some of the negative response, the Dying Light Twitter account clarified to one fan that you can complete the story and side-quests in 70 to 80 hours, "if you're not in a rush." Then, the official Twitter account took the messaging wide, saying that "500 ho…]]></summary>

That initial release was treated like a joke in the U.S. Yakuza was seen as a Japanese crime curio by some and an inferior Grand Theft Auto knock-off by others. But mostly, it was just ignored. 
Over the years, creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio continued to churn out one Yakuza sequel after the other. I remember a small minority in the gaming community praised the series’ combat, humor, and storytelling, but the general public broadly waved off these games. However, slowly something started to change. With each new Yakuza, that vocal minority grew until they just couldn’t be ignored.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Arceus is scheduled to arrive on Nintendo Switch on January 28. That’s not far away at all. Will the formula shake-up from the standard treatment prove to be a success? While that remains to be seen, a trailer unveiled today gives prospective players a taste of some of the experiences they can expect to see in the latest Pokémon entry. While it’s been already relayed that the game won’t be a “true” open world, it looks like the colorful little critters do roam free in various areas. Check out the full trailer below.

An action slant and style for the game seems to add quite a few new elements for players to engage with, while still maintaining the classic core of Pokémon. Based on the new trailer, it looks like crafting will be quite important as a mechanic, so that particular aspect is intriguing to me. Also, you can fly on a bird, which makes me wonder if the rest of the traditional HM abilities will be represented with heavy action and mobility. I’d say there’s a pretty good chance, especially since it looks like you can also surf around in the water on your favorite Gyrados.
Are you looking forward to a different direction in Pokémon for this title? Will it be a Switch smash hit to start the year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Raytracing has been a hot high-end graphics trend for a few years, with new games boasting support for the complex lighting simulators and old games being retrofitted with shine.

PlayStation released the full list of top downloads on the PlayStation Network in December today, and as usual, it gives us a great look at what players were interested in last month. While Among Us took the top spot on both PS4 and PS5 in the U.S., Canada, and EU, a big movie release helped push an older title into the number two spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is developing a "Scott Pilgrim" anime with creator and graphic novel artist Bryan Lee O’Malley. 
This news comes by way of The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that O’Malley will also write and executive produce the series based on his cult-classic graphic novel series (and subsequent film). Netflix is developing the adaptation with UPC, the group behind Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy and SyFy’s Chucky TV series.

O’Malley is writing and and executive producing this Scott Pilgrim anime alongside the showrunner for Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark? series, Ben David Grabinski. However, it’s important to note that a series order has not been made, so the anime isn’t entirely off the ground just yet – it’s simply in the works for now. If it’s picked up for a full series order, O’Malley and Grabinski will serve as the showrunners. 
As far as animation goes, it’s being handled by anime studio Science Saru (Devilman Crybaby, Star Wars Visions). Saru’s Eunyoung Choi will be a producer for Scott Pilgrim and the company’s Abel Gongora will direct the series. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the members of the Sex Bob-omb are set to be featured in the anime, with Scott Pilgrim movie director Edgar Wright and producing partner Nira Park also working as executive producers on the series alongside and Adam Seigel, Jared LeBoff, Marc Platt, and Michael Bacall.  
"Scott Pilgrim" was published as six volumes between 2004 and 2010 and Wright’s movie based on those volumes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, was released in 2010 with Michael Cera playing the titular character. There’s no word if any of the cast members from that film are returning for the anime. 
While waiting for the anime, read about why Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is still one of the best 2D brawlers out there.

It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

There’s the green tights version the world first met in 1948 and that slowly evolved into a green suit with purple accents. We also got more on-the-nose versions with some Riddler iterations dawning a costume covered in question marks and sometimes carrying a question mark cane.
Frank Gorshin’s Riddler from the 1960s Adam West Batman series (and movie) played with both the green suit look and the green tights look. Then, we saw Jim Carrey step into those tights in 1995’s Batman Forever and that was the last silver screen appearance of …]]></summary>

But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom's stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

Mostly though, it's just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By "more games", I mean "every game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That's okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn't how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don't think about it.

        <id>116904</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/10/elden-ring-is-steams-most-anticipated-game-after-taking-top-wishlist-spot-from-dying"/>
        <updated>2022-01-10T15:13:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring is seemingly the hype train that just won’t stop and with less than two months to go until release, it is now officially Steam’s most anticipated title. 
That’s because From Software’s upcoming action RPG is now the most wishlisted game on Steam. It’s an impressive feat for Elden Ring as Techland’s highly-anticipated sequel to 2015’s Dying Light held that spot for 12 months, as reported by Eurogamer. Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page is a great indicator for Steam player hype, but unfortunately, it does not reveal any specific numbers.
Click here to watch embedded media


However, someone wishlisting a game does not automatically translate to a purchase so if there were numbers, it wouldn’t necessarily be indicative of how much Elden Ring is going to sell on Steam. It’s a great indicator for general excitement around the title, though, and considering Dying Light 2 held the top spot for a year (after taking it from Cyberpunk 2077), Elden Ring is sitting pretty. 
For context, here’s what the top 10 on Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page looks like right now: 
Elden Ring
Dying Light 2 Stay Human
Party Animals
God of War (2018)
Hollow Knight: Silksong
The Day Before
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl
Starfield
Frostpunk 2
As you can see, Elden Ring is sitting above some very exciting releases such as Starfield, the PC version of God of War, and the sequel to indie darling Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Hopefully, Elden Ring delivers on all the hype it’s garnered so far. One Game Informer editor who previewed the game seems to think so. 
For more about Elden Ring, check out some gameplay from this New Gameplay Today segment and then watch the latest trailer released for Elden Ring. Read about the different resolution and performance priority modes featured in Elden Ring after that.

I've had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various "Happy Ending Mods" to change the close of Commander Shepard's story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.
Halo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson's aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST's relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie's push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

RPG fans had a pretty good 2021, from fantastic indies to new games in popular franchises. Bandai Namco gave us two stellar RPGs in Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus. Remakes and remasters, like Nier: Replicant, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, provided plenty of nostalgia, while also bringing new fans into the fold. Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface. Here are five RPGs worth your time that may have slipped past your radar.

Persona 5 (and its Royal expansion) is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The limited details surrounding the next game’s narrative, combat, and music have forced superfans like me to make their own wishlists. So, here are six – that’s right, six! – features I’d like to see in Persona 6:

They were excited to push the company’s tech and to bring a cult hit into Rockstar’s vision for the future. They were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a Rockstar studio, having recently been purchased by the company. They were excited to lead development on Bully 2, the sequel to Rockstar’s critically acclaimed open-world adventure about life in a private school.
But things don’t always go as planned, and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects. Rockstar New England’s Bully 2 was shelved in favor of other, more troubled projects in development, like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The King of Fighters XV is coming close to having a complete roster, with the frosty fighter Kula Diamond becoming the 38th member. 
Kula and her ice-centric moves were revealed in a new trailer this week. Formerly a member of Team K' in past King of Fighters installments, she's joined the tournament with newcomer Krohnen (who's mechanically a callback to the popular Akira-inspired KOF character K9999) and Ángel, a former NESTS assassin with a pro wrestling move set.

It would have been quite the shock if a fan-favorite face like Kula didn't make the main roster of KOFXV, but since she's the 38th character revealed from a confirmed roster of 39, other mainstays like Taekwondo practitioner Kim may have to wait for DLC or miss out entirely. There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there's only one spot on a team open, and it's alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. 
The King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.]]></summary>

From the industry which bought you "levelution", the "drivatar", and "gameplay trailers" which aren't gameplay comes a new one: "gameplay lore trailer". The year has barely begun but Ubisoft are gunning it out the gate with the new Rainbow Six Siege trailer. This new gameplay lore trailer—yeesh!—explains why a game set within Tom Clancy's serious world of paranoid jingoistic masturbation is overrun with a weird parasite mutating people into monsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone revealed last August that a new South Park game is in the works alongside “several spinoff movies” and more, and now, we know what studio is developing that title. 
Revealed on a Careers web page, Question Games, the team behind The Magic Circle and The Blackout Club, is working on a new South Park game and a job listing might hint at multiplayer. The listing also reveals that the game will be developed in Unreal Engine with an aim to release on “modern systems” such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“Question and South Park Digital Studios are seeking a Lead Level Designer for work on a new video game set in the world of South Park,” the Lead Level Designer job listing on Question Games’ Careers page reads. 
The requirements section of this listing reveals that multiplayer experience is a must for anyone who applies, which could hint that this South Park game could feature some kind of multiplayer. This would be especially interesting because both South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole were single-player. 
“Multiplayer Experience – Shipped at least one multiplayer game as a senior level designer or have equivalent relevant experience,” the requirements for the Lead Level Designer position read.

You can check out the full Careers page here, but there’s not much else to gleam from the listings. Whether or not this South Park game resembles the last two released or is something totally different, only time will tell. For now, read Game Informer’s South Park: The Stick of Truth review and then check out Game Informer’s South Park: The Fractured But Whole review.

Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the "time skip", instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren't without their flaws, but I'd argue they're less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Days Gone director Jeff Ross said Bend Studio's latest game sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, which recently hit a milestone after selling 8 million copies. However, in a recent livestream with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe, Ross revealed that his source for the sales numbers was a now-defunct website called Gamestat, which tracks PlayStation Trophy data, as reported by PushSquare. 
Here's what Ross said: "Where I got my data from, I had access to a lot of telemetry, and I could see stuff and when we were at 5 million copies – when we were announced at 5 million copies – the telemetry data was at 5.8 [million].

Does the idea of Pokémon Snap but with dogs appeal to you? Pupperazzi has you covered. Armed with your trusty camera, you’ll capture a variety of dog breeds in a world seemingly populated with nothing but canines. You’ll catch them doing all manner of strange things, like jamming to music, riding bicycles (somehow), or executing death-defying skateboard tricks. You can adorn pups in different outfits and upgrade your camera to capture better, more dynamic photos. Watch the most recent gameplay trailer below if you need something to cheer you up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CES is a gloriously mad hodgepodge of different tech fields; the kind where smartphone chip makers share floor space with car manufacturers and sex toys. It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won't find them here, but trust us, you'll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we've listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We've got games big and small here, and they're all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we've missed something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsurprisingly, E3 will once again not happen as an in-person event this year, what with the whole global pandemic and all. The Entertainment Software Association, who organise E3, had hoped that the main event on the video games industry's marketing calendar would return properly this year, after skipping 2019 and going online in 2020, but nope. While they haven't yet confirmed whether or not they'll arrange an online E3 in its stead, they seem to be considering it.

Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I'm nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can't be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

The high: the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, as new top-of-the-line CPU with 24GB of upgraded, 21Gbit/s GDDR6X VRAM. The low: the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 GPU in a donkey’s age.

Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale certainly isn't the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I'm well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft 'em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It's being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don't go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare's recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it's being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn't enough.

We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there's one thing I've learned about myself in 2021, it's that I'm a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don't provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I'm playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters' metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It's an ingenious system, as you're not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.
