        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Praise the gods, it's Hades 2 update day, and developers Supergiant are not mucking about. They have bolstered the nippy roguelike with a heap of shiny new things in this "Olympian Update", including a new weapon with homing attacks, a liver-pecking boss fight, two new animal familiars, and the home region of the Gods - mount Olympus. It's probably the biggest update they've made yet in terms of fresh sights. And by "fresh sights", I mean Dionysus sporting a leopard-print thong. Yikes.

Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

Hazelight Studio's co-op platformer It Takes Two has officially sold over 20 million copies since its initial launch in 2021.
This comes via an announcement from the official social media account confirming the milestone, accompanied by an image of the game's protagonists, Cody and May. It's important to note that the platform split for this isn't available, so it's unclear how many Switch copies have been sold specifically.

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

There are several ways to obtain these Ability items inside the game. While some are exclusive to summonings from Shenron and Porunga, others can be found inside the shop. You can simply spend your Zeni to buy them and use them for any character you like. With 50 different choices, it can be hard to select the best ones to use.


Best Ability items in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


I have considered only the effect of the Ability items when judging the best ones. Some of these items might be pretty hard to unlock/purchase, but their in-game effects in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will make it worth the extra effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A game featuring miniaturized characters has sold a massive amount of copies. It Takes Two has now crossed the 20 million milestone. On Wednesday, developer Hazelight Studios thanked fans for their support of the co-op game when it revealed the latest It Takes Two's sales numbers.


It Takes Two is a massive success


"You’re the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds!" said Hazelight Studios on X, formerly Twitter. "We’re so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May." The game's "F the Oscars" director Josef Fares said, "Beyond my wildest dreams," when reposting the news to his feed.

It Takes Two is a massive critical and commercial success for Hazelight Studios. It won Game of the Year at The Game Awards, beating out tough competition like Resident Evil Village, Metroid Dread, and Psychonauts 2 in 2021 for the top prize. The game received an 88 Metacritic score, which is an accomplishment in and of itself. 


It Takes Two offers a unique deal for those who want to play co-op games: If one person buys the game, they can invite a family member or friend to play with them for free. They just need to download the demo from the store. It also supports local couch co-op, which is not often seen in the modern gaming landscape. 


In April, Hazelight Studios teased on X that they'll be talking about "new (real good) stuff cooking" later in 2024. Perhaps this year's Game Awards will be the time we hear about this news. The It Takes Two sales numbers show there will be interest in the developer's next big game. Hopefully, no stuffed animals will be harmed in the making of it.

Terry Pratchett’s Discworld RPG: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork had an initial goal of $130,000, which it eclipsed in just 27 minutes.


The Kickstarter project has now reached $1 million in pledges, unlocking all but the last two stretch goals. With three weeks left on the campaign, it's likely that those will also be unlocked. Fulfillment is expected in August 2025.


The Discworld series of fantasy books was written by English author Sir Terry Pratchett, starting with The Colour of Magic in 1983 and culminating with The Shepherd’s Crown in 2015. The disc-shaped world sits on top of the back of four elephants who, in turn, are standing on t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been setting some spooky time aside this fall for Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion, you'll want to go ahead and make some new plans. Publisher XSEED Games announced a delay for the new entry that pushes it back to sometime in 2025.


According to the announcement, the delay was put in place "in the interest of improving game quality." When Corpse Party II launches next year, it will be available for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. 


In the meantime, fans of MAGES. and Team GrisGris's horror series can pre-order the game physically both in a standard and special edition. The latter is the Ayame's Mercy edition, which is priced at $79.99 and comes with a bunch of ghastly little tchotchkes. There's a "Save Yourself" blue LED candle that mirrors the in-game save points, a 64-page art book, a lenticular art card, and more.

Corse Party II takes the series previously known for its understated 2D visuals and gives it a full 3D overhaul. The story this time around follows high school friends Haruka Nanami, Nemu Takanashi, and Maria Hitsugi as they test a local urban legend while exploring the Amare Est Vivere Hospital. Of course, the legend of Ayame's Mercy turns out to be true. They wouldn't have a terrifying tale to tell otherwise, would they?


Now, they have a vengeful spirit to evade along with the rest of the horrors of the hospital's past, which are bubbling to the surface. If they want to survive, they'll have to dispel Ayame's curse for good. If that sounds like a tall order, well, you've got more time to dwell upon it while we wait for the new launch date to arrive.

There are plenty of better items than this Gomes card. However, this item is perfect for beginners in Ultimate Team. It can also play in three different positions, and has Role+ in both CAM and CM. The presence of Technical, Finesse Shot, and Incisive Pass are all great options to have.

The latest SBC is pretty similar to the Hero Upgrade SBC we got last week. This time, however, the stakes are higher, as some of the Icons have incredible valuations in the market. Naturally, the cost of completing the challenge is more. That said, let's first take a look at all the rewards you can possibly get by finishing the SBC. 


All EA FC 25 Max 87 Icon Upgrade SBC rewards


The Max 87 Icon Upgrade SBC features all Icons rated 87 or lower. This is the only negative side of the SBC, but there are still some amazing cards you can end up finding in Ultimate Team by completing the challenge.

Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

In more concrete terms, some of you may well remember that Heart of Chornobyl is the second time a STALKER 2 has been announced. Back in 2010, when the three classic STALKER games were still more-or-less the talk of the town, GSC Game World announced an honest-to-goodness STALKER 2 with a targeted launch window of 2012.

Before that, you should try Donut County. It's really good.

Personally, I like the classic, awkward feel of the original N64 controller. Rumors of it being uncomfortable are unfounded by anyone who knows how to hold it properly. The stick is garbage, but I’ve long since replaced them (recently, with 8BitDo’s own Hall Effect N64 sticks). However, most games were built with its form factor in mind.


However, if you don’t dig the classic T-Rex foot, then you may want to check out 8BitDo’s take on the controller. It has an appearance not far off from their Ultimate Controller but with face buttons that better emulate the N…]]></summary>

Atlus's latest RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio launched on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last week and, according to our friends at Push Square and Pure Xbox, it's really rather good. Naturally, a game of this size didn't end up making it to Switch, but that hasn't stopped some from playing it on a Nintendo handheld all the same (thanks, GamesRadar).
Reddit user bjatman8008 took to the game's forum to share their somewhat unconventional set-up for the epic RPG: a New 3DS XL. Yes, you read that correctly, they are playing it on Nintendo's 2014 clamshell console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're tired of Babidi's Brainwashing in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero's Episode battle mode, there's a way to avoid the conclusion and unlock a fresh storyline in the process.


The Episode battle mode re-enacts some of the iconic moments from the Dragon Ball series inside the game. However, there are plenty of alternate storylines as well, popularly known as Sparking episodes. You'll have to complete certain tasks before you can unlock them, and this is also true for Vegeta's Number One Spot Sparking episode. To unlock that, you'll need to learn how to not succumb to Brainwashing in one of the episodes on the main storyline.


How to shake off Brainwashing in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


Unless you complete certain prerequisites, you won't be given the chance to shake off Babidi's Brainwashing. To get the option, you'll need to complete the Preparing for the World Tournament episode in Vegeta's Wicked Heart saga in the default difficulty setting.

However, that's only part of it - to complete the hidden objective, you'll need to avoid taking too many hits (or absorb too much damage. The information isn't available on the main screen, unlike other episodes, which can make it quite confusing for players.


Now, you can follow your own strategy to defeat Trunks, but focus more on charging your Ki whenever you get the chance. You'll have to rely heavily on your Ki blasts and then execute the Cosmic Circle as the episode comes to an end. Do remember that all you've to do is reduce Trunks' health to complete the episode, and get the option to shake off Brainwashing.


If you choose to do so, it will also trigger the Number One Spot Sparking episode. If you want to learn how to complete the alternate storyline, make sure to check out our guide to explore all of Vegeta's Sparking episodes in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.

But how can you get the item? For those looking for an extra challenge, as well as all the collectors out there, here's how to get Broly's Ring in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.


How to get Broly's Ring in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero

Unfortunately, it looks horrid on modern displays, even if you’ve gone to the lengths I have to boost it RGB output and put it through a fancy upscaler.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

I need to climb down from this table if I’m ever going to meet up with my teammates and finish the game, but the stupid zombies cannot get me if I stay up here. It’s an absolute gherkin, I tell you. A real cornichonundrum.
The steel pipe in my right hand is doing a decent job of whittling them down, and the torch in my left lets me see the expressions of impotent rage on their flaky faces. Still, the pipe won’t last forever - this is videogame steel, the crumbliest steel there is. Thank god No More Room In Hell 2 doesn’t bother with the hunger or rest parts of the survival equation. I can, in theory, stay on this table forever.

After an unprecedented year of financial loss for the Japanese developer TOSE (a team that has co-developed countless projects for the likes of Nintendo, Square Enix, Capcom and more), the studio expects 'Switch 2' to turn things around in 2025 (thanks, Automaton).
Back in July, TOSE's Q3 financial report posted a nine-month loss of ¥367 million (about $2.28 million) due to several cancelled projects. And yet, the co-developer's recently revealed sales forecast (reported by Otaku Soken) for the next financial year is up 21.3%. Why? Because it's expecting 'Switch 2' to be a hit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fragpunk, a new first-person shooter in the Hero Shooter genre, has an ongoing playtest that you can join. Getting access to it is pretty easy, but if you're unaware, here's how you can get your invite.


How to join the Fragpunk beta test


The main way to get into the playtest is to Request Access through the Fragpunk Steam Store page. Using this method, you won't need a code or get into it. Instead, all you need is some patience and luck. The developers are actively inviting players to the test, so you probably won't have to wait long to get in (took me about a day). Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed access using this method.


Another method of getting access to the Fragpunk closed beta is by being an Xbox Insider. If you are already a subscriber of this service, you do not need to do anything extra. By being an Xbox Insider, you will automatically have a chance to receive an invite/code.

The third way of getting a code for the Fragpunk test is by, ironically, playing the game. Weirdly enough, you can earn a few codes by playing Ranked, which is certainly an incentive if you're looking to play with a few friends. Of course, this method assumes you already have access to the playtest, so it may not yet apply to you.


The final way to get into the Fragpunk playtest is to for giveaways. The developers are constantly sharing keys on their Official Discord, so you may be able to snag one this way if you're lucky.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

Curiously enough, the director of Street Fighter 6, Takayuki Nakayama, shed some light on this situation in an unexpected post on his personal Twitter/X account. On a thread in which he was disclosing his experiences while working on Otoranger (an old rhythmic game released on mobile devices back in 2013) he posted the following tweet:




Here, Nakayama explained how he hoped to work on a fighting game that was not Street Fighter, but Capcom stopped the development of this mysterious title before he eventually joined th…]]></summary>

Ah yes, the seemingly endless embrace of death, interspersed with feverish ability management and hordes of enemies shattering your fragile health bar. This is our relaxation time.
Kill Knight is a ferocious bullet hell with a heavy metal aesthetic and thumping score that recalls the modern Doom cycle. It’s an isometric twin-stick chaos simulator that’s painfully challenging from the start, but deeply satisfying to master.

Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. That's the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

The developer of 2022's The Outbound Ghost, Conradical Games (now working under the Radhood Games label), has revealed the release date for its next project, a survival roguelike billed as 'Vampire Survivors meets Slay the Spire'.
Soul Stalker lands on the Switch eShop on 24th October, and while we can certainly see hints of the two aforementioned titles in its bullet heaven gameplay and roguelike progression, it's nice to see that the developer's Paper Mario-inspired visuals also make a return — albeit in a slightly more stabby way.

Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blazin' squad.
A totally original pixel art fighting game in 2024 is certainly a welcome surprise. What’s more of a surprise, though, is discovering that Mark Minkyu Chung touts himself as a solo game developer. Known by his developer handle Rarebreed, we hopped to Blazing Strike’s credits roll to corroborate the seemingly impossible. And, sure enough, he appears to have done pretty much everything himself, from programming to art direction, rollback netcode implementation, and sound. Where he’s had help, he’s still the lead credit of two individuals for things like animation, character, and environment design. To that end, it appears Blazing Strike’s vast majority is indeed the effort of one man - a head-spinning feat considering the comprehensive nature of the end product.
A love letter to the fighting game hardcore, there’s plenty of SNK about Blazing Strike, with incredibly tall, superbly rendered sprites, tons of animation frames, and a scaling effect that zooms in and out based on the proximity of the combatants. Indeed, the game’s graphical style is arguably its most polished asset, and bears some visual kinship to Rage of the Dragons. The spritework appears genuine, as if it was crafted on old-school tools, and boasts a near-CPS3 quality (that being the hardware that fuelled Street Fighter III and Red Earth). The colour palette positively beams, with attractive blending, and, although samey at times, the backgrounds are truly top-notch, featuring a range of sci-fi cityscapes and in-theme prison courtyards.

That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

This is why I like the demo for first-person shooter Cop Bastard a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies.

The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

Skyrim Lead Designer and Starfield Systems Designer Bruce Nesmith has spoken a little about the “interesting problem” of how open developers should be about technical issues on day one, given the expectation some players have that every game should be "flawless".
When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti.

The tactility of their terror and the immersiveness of their worlds can make it hard for scaredy cats to even give one a chance, let alone get through it.

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long?

This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

Either way, this is my new favourite videogame, which gives every other game a lot to live up to.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades.

Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in Bylina. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and Steam. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

Result! So here’s a little after-dinner mint of a PC gaming hardware bargain: JSAUX’s Steam Deck thumbstick covers, which come packaged with some stick-on decals for £8 / $8. Both 20% off, they be, leaving a price so low I have real hope you’ll forgive me using the phrase "stocking stuffer" in October.

Which is harsh, because they can provide heaps of capacity at relatively attainable prices, as the Crucial BX500 is currently demonstrating. Per Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon UK is running the 2TB version for just £92 (34% off) as well as 4TB for £178 (41% off). Meanwhile, Amazon US is lopping 43% off the 1GB model, bringing it down to $54, with the 4TB model shedding 13% to reach $210.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re not militant about meeting all the latest hardware standards, but do need an upgrade in the CPU department, the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D is close to perfect. Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Oh wait, I read the press release wrong. Thunderful are actually having a Steam sale, with up to 90% off such well-regarded games as Laika: Aged Through Blood, Swordship, Viewfinder and, just to confuse me further, several SteamWorld games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years since they emerged as a serious screen option for PC games, OLED monitors still haven’t cracked the issue of how they just look too bloomin’ expensive next to similarly specced LCD displays. Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

Or a lack thereof. The 1TB model is down to £70 at Amazon UK, but I think the Yanks have us beat here, as they can nab the 2TB edition for just $140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

Now, the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale has a twin-fan Asus model down to £340 in the UK – the lowest this particular graphics card has ever been, and as far as I can tell, the least you’d have to pay for a brand-new RTX 4060 Ti in the current market.

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silent Hill 2 remake is only out today, but it’s been nearly two years since the first system requirements appeared, immediately distressing our PCs so badly that they started having their own nightmares of fog-smothered towns and James Sunderland in an uncomfortably high-poly nurse outfit. Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Výtvarně nádherné, ale jinak... Jako kdyby si v DreamWorks řekli "VALL-I, Železný obr a Laputa byly fajn, ale moc sofistikované. Pojďme natočit něco pro NORMÁLNÍ děti!" A to je škoda, protože tenhle film si klade potenciálně velmi zajímavé otázky, ale většinu z nich ignoruje na úkor roztomilých zvířátek a ujetého robota.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Film má docela originální námět, ze kterého by mohlo vzniknout něco opravdu unikátního, kdyby měl lepší scénář, lepšího režiséra a lepší herce. Takhle je to 10 zajímavých minut na začátku, pak hodina nudy a pak 30 minut WTF, ve kterých už není možné nijak soucítit s nikým na plátně a bylo mi srdečně jedno, co se vlastně "doopravdy" stalo.

Znovu se ukazuje, že Sláma bravurně zvládá drobné situace, ale má problémy s dvouhodinovým, někam směřujícím dějem. Krobot je jako obvykle úžasný. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
