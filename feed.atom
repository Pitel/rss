But because it’s essentially a small PC, the temptation is always there to improve it.

Team Fortress 2 and Hotline Miami are an unlikely match, but in the realm of just-go-for-it-and-see-what-sticks fan games, this funky fusion works well enough. Midnight Mercenaries, a top-down action game released for free on Game Jolt, lets you cleave through heavily armed enemies as familiar TF2 classes like the Scout, Heavy, and Spy. It's definitely worth a run-through if you've got the time. (Thanks, Rock, Paper, Shotgun.)
Imagine smacking a Hotline Miami goon from afar with a baseball, or unloading a minigun on a room of baddies (then blowing yourself up with a barrel). That's Midnight Mercenaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Play the hit indie game Papers, Please on your mobile devices
Originally released all the way back in 2013, Papers, Please is a legendary indie game that helped reimagine what a video game can be. In the game, players take on the role of a government border control agent in a fictional country called Arstotzka, and must decide who gets to come into the country while on the lookout for fake passports. Of course, it's never as easy as it appears, because players' morality is tested when asylum seekers and other people in need ask to be let through. It's a fairly simply game, mechanically speaking, but its story is one that has stuck with players for nearly a decade now.
Papers, Please is set to release on mobile platforms on August 5, 2022, as was announced by a tweet from the game's creator, Lucas Pope. Based on the picture he included, the game also looks like it's been optimized for a vertical format, so you won't even have to turn your phone sideways to play. Pope also said that some of the in-game timers have been adjusted, and the interface is "completely different," so there's only one booth upgrade. Papers, Please will be getting a standalone mobile release, as opposed to some subscription-based releases that have become more common recently.
Pope was all jokes in the Twitter replies, saying that the console release was coming in 2031 and, when another game dev sarcastically asked about a VR release, replied simply with "unlike." I do love game developers with a sense of humor.
https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1550895020861181952
If you've still yet to play this indie classic, this mobile release could be the perfect way to do it. Sure, it might be a little intense to play on the go at times, but the game makes for a really compelling pocket-sized experience. You can play through the story campaign, or give the endless mode a try, but either way you can't really go wrong.

        <updated>2022-07-25T21:30:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appearances can be deceiving
You are on a quest to a cabin. And inside the cabin, there is a princess. But as the name implies, Slay the Princess is not necessarily about a valiant rescue.
Rather, you're going to have to do some slaying.
Developer Black Tabby Games announced its next project, Slay the Princess, today. And it is a good pitch. You're on your way to a cabin in the woods to kill a princess. Do this, and you'll save the world. Fail, and you doom it. But she's a princess, right? How bad could she really be?
Well, watch the trailer below and draw your own conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RByDoYQpFa8
The story plays on trust, choice, and of course, lots of horror. Because despite any immediate takes on the matter, this princess is a lot more than just that. As the Steam page notes, you will probably die a lot on your quest. Also, don't try to romance her, or talk to her, or hear her out. But also, who's to say this narrator is trustworthy either?

Not quite a knight in shining armor
Slay the Princess is a really cool concept, and from a pretty interesting team too. Black Tabby Games had some word-of-mouth going about a previous horror adventure, Scarlet Hollow. It's clear the team has some chops when it comes to writing interesting horror narratives.
Plus, from the trailer alone, the art style looks fantastic. And the voice work from Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight adds a ton, too. It reminds me a bit of fellow pencil-sketch horror game Mundaun, mixed with a visual novel-style presentation. With some branching paths, possible loops, and probably some secrets to uncover, Black Tabby Games has my attention.
Slay the Princess is aiming for a 2023 launch. Those who can't wait can get early access to a two-hour demo through Black Tabby's Patreon here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swords & Solcery
The weekend's San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) brought with it a wide variety of plastic fantastics, as various merch-makers showed off tabletops full of figurines, statues, and other paraphernalia related to some of the biggest and most popular global gaming brands. Storm Collectibles was in attendance, shining a spotlight on various upcoming Street Fighter and Darkstalkers figures for its partner, Capcom.
But Guilty Gear fans did not go away empty-handed, as Storm also brought with them the completed prototype of GG's hard-edged and hard-edgy poster boy Sol Badguy. The new premium figure sees the badass bounty hunter ready to lay the smack down on his next opponent, armed with his faithful and ferocious blade, Outrage MkII. The Sol Badguy figure features a finely sculpted, fully poseable body and comes complete with five pairs of interchangeable hands, three head sculpts, and an optional flame effect to punctuate his more dynamic poses.
https://twitter.com/stormcohk/status/1551498418056339456?s=20&t=ADr7XpjkQWw16PCSzXQ9fQ
Storm, curiously, has not listed the height of the new figure, but Sol Badguy is listed in their 1/12 scale category, so we can probably expect him to stand between 10-to-12 inches. Retailing for a very princely $95 (not including shipping), pre-orders for Sol are live over on the official Storm Collectibles website, ahead of his expected release window of early 2023 — which is quite a fast turnaround for a modern collectible.
Sadly, there was no sign of any Testament figures, statues, or models at SDCC this year. Oh well, maybe next time. If you want to take a look at Storm's Street Fighter reveals from the weekend's event, then be sure to check out our Street Fighter SDCC 2022 roundup article right here.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5000 processors are getting ever cheaper, with the mid-range Ryzen 5 5600 today crossing the £130 barrier for the first time. You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest development involves collectible magazines and cars
The Fallout London mod, a fan creation that's built off of the Fallout 4 foundation, looks better and better every time I see something new pop up for it. That includes this most recent post from the game's Twitter account.
Fallout London will be bringing back the "magazine pickups that boost your stats" conceit from the core series, but with a UK-based twist. Now some of the mags will be centered around London upgrades, including owner and repair manuals for in-game cars. The aesthetic is based on the Haynes Manual line: a UK publisher that's produced a long-running (since the '60s) series of manuals mostly focused around the automotive industry. Cars that will be featured in the game include the Routemaster, Tater T, P90, and Cutlass varieties.
All this lines up with what the development team has said in the past regarding how they want Fallout London to feel different: "As a divergence from previous official titles in the series, Fallout London is not set in America. Visiting a totally new setting allows for us to explore totally new cultures which have not homogenized with their American counterparts. It also allows us to explore pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain."
https://twitter.com/FalloutLondon/status/1550580481363935232
Fallout London release date
The mod is still slated for a 2023 release, as of this past month. Given how active the team has been on Twitter, it's safe to say that we'll be getting a lot more updates until then!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's one of several free updates planned for Sunbreak
The Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak August title update is coming up really cool, and Capcom has given us a quick preview of what to expect on Twitter. Here's the rundown:
"For the first Title Update, we're adding new content regarding Anomaly Research. In relation to that, here's a sneak peek at Qurious Crafting, which allows for armor upgrades. The upgrades utilize new materials that will be added with the update. Please look forward to more news!"

In short, you'll be using reagents from the update to augment your armor. The details are still coming, but some of the community surmises that different materials will provide different stats. Either way, more armor customization is generally a good thing, and will likely lead to crazier builds and faster clear times for speedrunners. Anomaly quest grinding is already popular for a lot of players, so this could add even more replay value: on top of the new monsters and extra content coming.
As a reminder, Capcom has provided a glimpse into what's next for the game via an official roadmap. You can find a recap of what's coming in the August update below.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Title Update 1 (August)
Seething Bazelgeuse
Lucent Nargacuga (and “several other monsters”)
New locale: Forlorn area
Rare species monsters

At San Diego Comic-Con this weekend, Capcom debuted a brand new trailer for its upcoming Jurassic lark, Exoprimal, which remains currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The new preview focuses specifically on the reptilian roster of dinosaurs and "NeoSaurs" that are running amok throughout our future cities. Like a scaly version of Earth Defense Force, we see the streets literally swarming with creatures, as our desperate but highly skilled squad of Exofighters attempt to put a halt to the dawn of a new prehistoric era. Check out the wild action for yourself below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQNlDJ2I59s
A lot of monstrous city mashers on display there, from the natural horrors of the Pteranodon, Ankylosaurus, and the Triceratops to a new wave of creatures including the Pyro Neosaur, Neo Ankylosaurus, and the devastating Neo T. Rex. I think my favorite part is the very absurd moment when an enormous herd of Velociraptors is literally seen spilling from the skies.
I'm not entirely sure of the specific corner of the market Exoprimal is aiming for, nor whether it will succeed in capturing long-term multiplayer interest but — as you can see in the new trailer above — it's shaping up to be a good-looking title, with some interesting concepts and exciting action. We shall see. If you wish to be considered for closed beta access, then you can sign-up right now over on the official Exoprimal website.
Exoprimal is currently expected to launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox at some point in 2023.

Blizzard has finally spilled the beans on the World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King Classic release date, and it's ready to go on September 26, 2022.
It's set to arrive at 3PM PT on that date, and will once again follow suit with prior "classic" extensions in that it will be included for current subscribers without a separate fee. Starting with a Death Knigh at level 55, the achievement system, and the inscription profession are all back in, as are all 13 dungeons and nine raids from the base release.
As for what's new, it's a bunch of meta/account-related stuff, and Blizzard has provided further clarification on that today:
"In the lead-up to launch, players can experience Joyous Journeys, a 50%-bonus-XP event that will run until Wrath of the Lich King Classic’s September 26 launch. Prior to release, all WoW subscribers will be granted the ability to create one Death Knight per Classic realm, which they can bring to level 70 through Burning Crusade Classic content until September 26. In addition, players will also be able to purchase optional upgrades, including new cosmetic items and a level-70 character boost for those who might not yet have a fully leveled character."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7VBka-A3hc
Before the Wrath of the Lich King Classic release date, we'll get more retrospectives
The publisher clearly still holds this expansion in high regard, as they're putting out a retrospective celebration of sorts throughout the year. The first episode can be viewed here, and runs through topics from aesthetic choices unique to Wrath of the Lich King, to some insight into the technical aspects of the engine, and the advancements that they were able to implement going forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can see the Breath of the Wild split-screen mod in action below
A Zelda: Breath of the Wild split-screen multiplayer mod is like a dream come true, especially if it can be done with extra processing power. Well, dream no more.
Created by modder Kirbymimi, the mod adds multiplayer to the popular action-adventure romp. As the modder notes, the project was spurred by the desire to create new emergent situations that are only possible through the power of multiplayer, like sneaking into a bokoblin camp with one player serving as a distraction, while the other does a pincer maneuver. Or, spur-of-the-moment events like a plain old-fashioned shield race down a cliff, or taking down a boss together.
The mod actually supports up to four players, but right now there are some technical limitations. As is, using the link above, everyone shares the same screen, so a button to teleport everyone to the lead player is needed. However, as the popular YouTube channel Waikuteru points out, split-screen is also possible thanks to a beta version of the mod that's coming out on July 29.
Now there are still technical limitations. As Waikuteru notes, the game "starts to lag if people are too far away" from one another, so it's best for everyone to stay in the same area for the Breath of the Wild split-screen mod. Still, we can expect further refinements down the line, and the fact that this is even possible is amazing.

Daedalic's new LOTR adventure is pushing its release date back a bit. Nacon and Daedalic Entertainment are pushing the launch of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum back a few months to an indeterminate date.
No more has been confirmed about Gollum's new date, except that it is "a few months" out from its original. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was previously set to launch on September 1, 2022.
In a statement on the delay, Daedalic says it has been pushed in order to deliver the "best possible experience" for the Gollum game. An update more exact timing will arrive sometime in the near future.

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is slotted to launch on both generations of Xbox and PlayStation hardware, as well as PC and the Nintendo Switch. It's unclear if the launch date will affect the Nintendo Switch date in particular, as it had previously been pushed back from the other versions' September 1 date. We reached out to clarify, but were told Daedalic has no further comment at this time.
Waiting in the darkness
Gollum's very own video game is a bit different than the hack-and-slash or role-playing games you might be used to from the Lord of the Rings game.
Rather, it's a stealth affair, suited to Gollum's own talents of sneaking around and leaping onto people's backs. Plus, balancing the careful line between Smeagol and Gollum, and getting the narrative bits right. Although one section of this cinematic trailer where Gollum dumps lava on some orcs looks pretty alright.

While the Fellowship had their time in the spotlight, Lord of the Rings: Gollum will give the little hobbit who's down on his luck his due. It'll just take a little extra time for all the pieces to come together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game "by a few months." 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

A Sonic Frontiers playable public event will be held in just a few months at EGX when the game is set to be shown off openly in the UK, rather than the prior behind-the-curtain setup of Summer Game Fest.
So far the Sonic Frontiers marketing cycle has been shrouded in mystery, with what has become known as "early gameplay" being shown off as a result of a lengthy "IGN First" campaign. From there the game has gotten a mixed reception from the aforementioned behind-closed-doors press-only preview session at the Summer Game Fest event in June, and folks are still largely on the fence regarding yet another foray into the 3D Sonic arena.
Now, a huge collective of people will be able to judge it for themselves...in a couple of months. The news of a playable version comes directly from the EGX Twitter account, which states that the game "will be heading down to #EGX2022 in lightning speed...giving you the UK First Play of Sonic Frontiers!" The event will be held in Excel, London from September 22 through September 25, 2022.
There's a lot to unpack here, but this potentially means that Sega is likely going to be mum on the game for the next few months, as they still aim for a "2022 release" (a window cited as recently as today in the announcement).

It's reportedly in very early development, and is a "big, open-world" Black Panther game. It also, apparently, won't be a live-service game. The project started due to the success of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kamiya reminds us that Nintendo even wanted the Link outfit to be more revealing
The new Bayonetta 3 naive mode is an optional toggle that makes the game less revealing — and apparently, it was Platinum's idea. The Bayonetta 3 naive mode move was done so that everyone could enjoy the game.
Speaking on Twitter in response to a fan (and all of the speculation that Nintendo "made Platinum Games do it"), outspoken Platinum producer Hideki Kamiya notes that Nintendo has "never complained about exposure" before in the series, including this new entry. In fact, he says that in Bayonetta 2, when adding the extra Link (Zelda) costume to the game for the Nintendo edition, the company asked if it was "okay to expose Link's chest more." That last bit is actually public info revealed on a Platinum Games post in 2014.
Kamiya goes on to say that he thought Nintendo would be a more "square" company, but he's had a good relationship with them, and they're able to talk directly about issues and strategy together. It behooves Platinum to play ball with Nintendo, but at this point they've been in business for so long (and see the relationship as mutually beneficial), so they have a rapport.
I figured this was always the case. Nintendo allowed the first two games to hit Nintendo consoles after all, and has sanctioned games that overstep even more boundaries on the platform as well. For a long, long while now (Devil's Third helped solidify it) Nintendo has been open to more mature games, so Bayonetta 3 isn't special in this regard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven't been heard from in a good while. There's a good chance we'll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

A Stray Garfield mod? I mean, I don't think I've been sold on something so quickly in 2022 as when I first eyed this clever creation.
When you think about it, it's something that almost should have been in the game already as a parody/unlock skin. But modder crubino managed to just say what we were all thinking, and has allowed everyone to play as Garfield in the fur with a mod that's fairly quick to install and get working.
I've said it before many times as an action game fan, but skins/outfits are such an easy way to get me to replay something; especially with added mechanics and VFX. While the Garfield mod doesn't have that yet (it's currently just a skin), that's the beauty of the modding community: someone could theoretically add quips/sound effects into the mix that are relevant to what's happening on screen. I'd play a "Quest for Odie" mod.
Stray Garfield mod download and instructions
To install it, it's as easy as heading to this page from creator crubino, and extracting it into Stray/Hk_project/Content/Paks. That's it!
There are no restrictions on the mod, nor are there any known conflicts or extra requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak."
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uh, I'll believe it when I see it
A Funko platformer? Uh, maybe I'd play it! I mean it is Funko. But it's also a platformer! I'm erring on the side of "this won't excite a lot of people."
As for the details, well there isn't much, but there's something! Funko actually revealed the news at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) this past weekend, noting that the partnership involves a development deal with 10:10 Games, and "some of the industry's best creators." The UK studio has no real pedigree right now as an organization (it formed in mid-2021), and the "AAA Funko platformer" due in 2023 will be their first test.
Right now they're focused on "developing AAA content for current and next-gen consoles and PC," and the project itself is untitled. Strangely, the game is aiming for a "T for Teen" rating, which will be wild to see play out in real time. Hopefully it ends up faring better than the now-closed Gears Pop game.
That said, if this is somehow as far removed from the Funko aesthetic as possible, a "AAA platformer" sounds enticing on paper. You just don't see very many of them anymore, as that's mostly reserved for the indie space. Sadly, Toys for Bob and Vicarious Visions could have had that area on lock, but they were folded into various bits of Activision as support studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PSP remake headed to modern PlayStation platforms
Following on from a slew of whispers, leaks, and accidental reveals, we have our best evidence yet that Square Enix's 2010 remake Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is preparing to make its grand return to the modern market. The re-remake has been all but confirmed via scout site PS Deals, who have spotted Tactics Ogre: Reborn on the backend of the PlayStation Network (PSN).

Tactics Ogre is itself a remake of the original Let Us Cling Together release, which first dropped on Super Famicom in 1995 before receiving ports on both PlayStation and Sega Saturn. According to the new PSN listing, Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be released on both PS4 and PS5 platforms and will feature further upgraded audio/visual content, fully voiced Japanese/English cutscenes, as well as a gameplay redesign set to bring the remake "to life" while remaining true to the original title's roots.

Tactics Ogre: Reborn will painstakingly recreate every visual, sprite, and character portrait in HD, and features live re-recordings of the game's soundtrack. New gameplay options will include battle speed sliders, auto-save options, and an overhauled U.I. and control system, designed to help new players delve into Tactics Ogre's tactical role-playing action in minutes. In addition, the enemy A.I. has been rewritten to provide a smarter, greater challenge for veteran players and newcomers alike.

The listing suggests that Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as both a digital and physical release, with a tentative street date of November 11, though no price was listed. While this is certainly not the first time we are hearing about the new remake, it is assuredly the most informative leak to date.

Hello good buddies, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? It's been a scorcher of a week here in Blighty, where temperatures soared higher than they have ever been since records began. A tad worrying, to be honest, despite the interminable ramblings from miserable, Daily Mail-types who insisted that we were all being "cowards" by not wanting heatstroke. I swear that the Venn diagram of people who are angry at masks, angry at pronouns, and, apparently, angry at The Fucking Sun represents some kind of self-destructive death cult.
But that's enough ranting, because what matters is us — here and now on the good ship Destructoid. I hope that this weekend finds you exceptionally well, in a cheerful mood, and free of lobster-red sunburn. Make the very most of the …]]></summary>

Bright Memory: Infinite has been a game I’ve admired from afar since word of it first dropped a couple of years ago. The idea that a single person was developing an action shooter that looked like it could belong to a AAA developer was intriguing, if only for what it said about the future of indie development.

Unfortunately, most of the possibilities were never met. Bright Memory: Infinite sputtered out of the gate with middling reviews that focused on its limited scope, bugs, and an exceptionally short playtime. While I’d argue most would agree it was an impressive attempt, its final release still di…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia's entire cinema industry is on the brink of collapse. A few weeks ago, around 16 cinemas were screening pirate copies of the latest movies; last week it was 127. Not even the chairman of the Association of Cinema Owners can muster much optimism. "I can't even blame cinemas now dabbling in torrent screenings," he says. It's not a desire to make money, but a fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say, you look mighty familiar...
Nope, you're not seeing things. These familiar little characters, whom you no doubt recognize from the 1986 hit Bubble Bobble, first made their gaming debut two years earlier. They were the enemy characters in Taito's formative platformer Chack'n Pop, which is, incidentally, this week's entry to Hamster's Arcade Archives range.
Released in arcades in 1984, before finding its way to a host of preliminary console platforms, Chack'n Pop is a painfully cute cartoon adventure starring a globular character with comically extendable legs. Players are tasked with guiding Chack'n, (for that is his name), through a series of mazes, utilizing his extra-long appendages to clamber over walls, attach to ceilings, and squeeze through small gaps. Standing in Chack'n's way is a posse of "Monstas" and Mightas," who must be either avoided or subdued with a supply of bouncing explosives. Chack'n is, it appears, a real demolition blob.

Chack'n Pop would be a hit in Japanese arcades thanks to its cute 'n' colorful nature, before heading into the home via a series of ports on platforms such as the Famicom, the SG-1000, the FM-7, and MSX. The game's true legacy, however, lies in its introduction of various famous sprites, that Taito would reuse as enemy characters in Bubble Bobble, arguably the title that truly put the developer on the global gaming map. Chack'n himself is considered an important part of company history and has since made cameo appearances in later releases such as Bubble Memories, NY Captor, and Ben Bero Beh.
Chack'n Pop is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get in, play for a month, get out
While EA Play isn't something I would subscribe to year-round, it can be useful in small, strategic doses. And right now, there's a deal for new subscribers — you can get a month of EA Play for $0.99 on PC or PlayStation, which includes access to the Play List library.
It's honestly worth checking the lineup to see if anything stands out.
No shade, but it's not all sports — there's Lost in Random, It Takes Two, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, Unravel Two, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, to name a few highlights. I'm sure plenty of people do subscribe just for the annual series, though. Nothing wrong with that if the timing works out. I've definitely played games with EA Play that I don't care at all about owning.
[caption id="attachment_336093" align="alignnone" width="1587"] A sample of full games in the Play List.[/caption]
It Takes Two caught on in a huge way — people like forming feel-good co-op memories with their close ones, who knew? — but don't forget about Lost in Random. It's a fairy-tale adventure game with an unforgettable Tim Burton/Henry Selick-inspired world.
Beyond full games, EA Play also has 10-hour trials for titles like F1 22 and GRID Legends.
The deal expires August 4
The $0.99 deal is in effect for EA Play on PS4, PS5, Steam, and Origin; it expires on August 4, and again, it's geared toward new subscribers. You can use this site to sign up for your preferred platform, but remember to turn off auto-renewal before your month is up.
For reference, EA Play is normally $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year.
Also worth reiterating: if you're subscribed to Xbox game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, you've already got EA Play baked into your membership. The lines are blurred these days.

Education is extremely important, but I hated school. I was never very good at it. I’m not very book smart. Then again, I’m not very street smart. What I’m getting at is: I’m not very smart in general, so school wasn’t right for me.
Self-deprecation aside, I think it’s just the academic system I don’t like. I don’t care about grades. How do you even make a child care about aptitude scores? Do you know what children do care about? Defeating Bowser. So in the early ‘90s, Nintendo loosened its grip on the Mario franchise long enough for a smattering of edutainment games to be produced. They’re not fondly remembered, which is funny because many adults still cling to the edutainment games of their youth.

This weekend, Capcom is putting in an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) 2022, showing off the recently released Capcom Fighting Collection and its upcoming sequel, Street Fighter 6.
Yesterday, the long-time developer/publisher held a special Q&A panel to discuss the two titles. Sadly, in regards to SF6, we did not receive any new footage, nor a character reveal. Capcom didn't send us away totally empty-handed, however, as it shared a selection of new screens confirming classic/nostalgia costumes for SF6's posse of World Warriors.

Among the images are old-school cool looks for The Strongest Woman in the World, Chun-Li, the endless wanderer Ryu, and everybody's favorite Family Man, Guile. In addition, we saw some new duds for newcomers Luke and Jamie.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The classic meme lives on in a Stray mod
Long after the conversations about David Cage's infamous 2010 game Heavy Rain have faded away, one meme lives on in a single word: "Jason!" For those who may be blissfully unaware, in the game, there's a moment where the player has to hit X to yell for their missing son Jason. It became a classic meme pretty much overnight, and cemented Heavy Rain's place as one of the most notorious games of all time.
Fast forward to 2022, and Stray is winning the hearts of gamers everywhere with its adorable, fuzzy protagonist. Because you're playing as a cat, there's even a whole button dedicated to meowing... oh wait, I see where they're going with this. Modder Gibrietas took one look at that button and knew what they had to do -- mod Stray so that instead of meowing, your cat yells "Jason" (originally spotted by IGN).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIsgvTYxII
Now I guess I need to buy the PC version of this game too so I can mod it, because the idea of running around a dystopian cyberpunk city as a cat yelling "Jason" at everyone seems like a pretty awesome way to get to experience the game. Not only that, but you're also gonna be yelling "Jason" in various tones and inflections, as is true to Heavy Rain. Kudos to you, Gibrietas, for dedicating yourself to that level of detail.
While the JASON mod is easily the most ridiculous we've seen of the Stray mods, it's only one of many. I personally love that most of the mods for the game on Nexus are reskins of the protagonist so that gamers can play with a cat that looks like their own. Other highlights include one that allows your cat to wear glasses, one that turns the loading screen into Nyan Cat, and one that makes the cat slightly fatter.

If you’re coming into Time on Frog Island expecting something along the lines of A Short Hike, know that it actually shares a lot more DNA with The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening than that indie darling. Set on the titular Frog Island, you take up the role of a pipe-biting sea captain who finds himself shipwrecked after a particularly violent storm. With his vessel in shambles, the captain will have to rebuild his ship with the help of the island’s residents. But they’re not here to do anything for free. If you want their assistance, you’re going to need to give them something in return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.
Hasbro also announced a Cal Kestis Vintage Collection figure is on the w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sincerest form of flattery
Back when I covered Cybernator, someone suggested that I try 1995's Metal Warriors on Super Nintendo. It was touted as a sequel to Cybernator. It’s not, but we’ll get to that. I said I didn’t have that kind of money to drop on a single game. Well, time makes fools of us all, as now I have a copy. Don't ask.
Metal Warriors is something I only knew existed because of its value. I have a whole book on the history of Lucasarts, and I don’t remember it even mentioning it (though it has been a while since I last cracked its spine). It was designed by the creators of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, a game that I am very familiar with. However, Metal Warriors’ pricetag kept me away. Which is one of the biggest problems with the collector’s market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new indie horror game released today has challenged players to beat it within Steam's two-hour window to claim a refund. Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <updated>2022-07-22T14:21:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

That’s why it’s awesome to see someone using the power of publicly accessible AI to generate fantasy mugshots for classic examples of the genre such as Baldur’s Gate. Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog's development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-21T20:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <updated>2022-07-21T15:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four hours with Saints Row, it's funny being back in the present. I have a gaming PC! Bills to pay! A smartphone that recognises my face! Grey hairs! I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

Thankfully, its latest quality of life update might just be the thing I need. As well as introducing a swathe of new accessibility features, its auto-walk function now has a toggle option - and as developers Crows Crows Crows have noted on Twitter, this means that "so long as you're in a straight corridor it allows the game to play itself!"

It takes some serious stamina to scroll through the patch notes. Looks like it might be worth perusing all the way through them though, with this 3.94 update to the game majorly reworking freighter bases and shipping in some NPC crew members to populate them with. This crew will even share their thoughts as they’re wandering about. See for yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. 
Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a vaguely Yakuza sort of way, we've been treated to our first glimpse of what's likely to be Yakuza 8. First spotted by Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura and his team posted a video of them touring Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's offices before he gets his face scanned by a wall of cameras. But before the face-scanning, they record snippets of the Yakuza: Like A Dragon lads having a heated discussion in a small apartment. Ichiban has a ponytail! Apparently, there's a new town? And I got my mum to translate some bits. Sorry mum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post on the official BioWare website, Star Wars: The Old Republic's creative director, Charles Boyd, announced his departure. Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, Lego has dished out its fair share of nostalgia-inducing sets, from massive Star Wars tributes to a faithful, brick-by-brick replica of the NES. Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/19/yakuza-8-screenshots-possibly-revealed-in-studio-tour"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T13:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Both hit the 2560x1440 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, with the Canvas 27QHD being a flat 27in screen and the Canvas 32QHD Curved being 32in and… well, curved. They support AMD FreeSync Premium, meaning they should work with Nvidia G-Sync as well, and come with anti-glare coatings to see off reflections.

Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I've found a new favourite show when it's impossible to stop watching. That feverish ferocity to see just one more episode is the best feeling. As Dusk Falls, an interactive story about a robbery gone wrong in Arizona, managed to evoke that feeling early on and carry it throughout my roughly seven-hour playthrough.

That’s why the idea of tackling the game’s die-rise-repeat formula without taking a single hit and never levelling your character’s runes is pretty dang impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK government has called for games companies to take greater responsibility in protecting children and young people from harm linked to loot boxes, including mental health issues and gambling problems. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that games companies and platforms needed to ensure parental purchase controls and age restrictions were in place to let kids play without the risk of harm, and to put parents’ minds at ease. Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.

One day, fun remarks like this will seem as on-the-nose as expository newspaper headlines and graffiti in zombie films have seemed during the pandemic.

So to casually sweep that under the rug with no further thought or action (as genre conventions demand), why not tell me what you're playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

Part of that process involves introducing a skill tree, the first of its kind within the franchise. Sonic has long had adventures that involve him unlocking new abilities, but by introducing a full skill tree in Frontiers, Sonic Team hopes to further enhance what it claims will be the longest mainline game in franchise history.
"Combat with enemies is an important part of Sonic Frontiers," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "Starting out with Sonic at full power would make the combat simple and repetitive, so we made it so the player gradually unlocks Sonic's abilities through the skill tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new developer diary has revealed that the new Skate title, which has been officially dubbed simply “Skate.” (period included), will be a free-to-play game. A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

While individual riders get the fame, it is a team sport with complex tactics and strategies across each stage and the overall race—which sometimes leave me flummoxed. So to help me better understand, I've been playing two strat-o-management games: the flashy Pro Cycling Manager 2022 (from the makers of the official Tour De France game) and the board game-esque indie game The Cyclist: Tactics.

Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn't expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I've identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you'll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray’s launch is just around the corner, and cat-lovers everywhere have another reason to get excited. Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the unfulfilling story of Sonic Forces in 2017, many were concerned about the direction of future narratives. When Sonic Frontiers was first announced, fans were happy to learn that longtime Sonic the Hedgehog comics writer Ian Flynn joined Sonic Team in writing the game. Flynn has been a prominent writer across both the long-running Archie Comics and IDW Publishing runs of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with hundreds of credits to his name. However, joining Sonic Team for a mainline entry is new territory.
"Ian has been working as a comic writer for a long time, so I was very familiar with his work, but after reading the IDW comics, I was even more impressed with his talent," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "That's why I wanted to ask him to work on the story fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. crossover platform fighter MultiVersus will soon be playable once again, this time to everyone who wants to throw down. The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>
