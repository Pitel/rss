        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shade is a new brawler that is going to debut in Brawl Stars on November 29, 2024. Since Halloween is nearby, it was expected that the new brawler would be based on the spooky theme. And just as expected, Shade is a ghost that possessed a pile of clothes. 


Shades joins the Ghost Station trio along with Gus and Chuck. What’s even better is that he has an incredible 7000 HP and can travel anywhere on the map. In this article, we are going to discuss Shade’s Main Attack and Super in Brawl Stars.


Main Attack of Shade in Brawl Stars

Shade basically swings his arms to attack enemies in his range. In terms of stats, he can deal damage to an enemy twice in one swing, and each one of them inflicts 1600 damage. So when you do the math, he can deal a maximum of 3200 damage per swing.


Super of Shade in Brawl Stars


Shade can also dash when his Super is activated. During his Super, he becomes transparent and can pass through the walls. What’s so special about him is that he can basically go anywhere, float on water, pass through walls, you name it. And yes, not just pass through walls; he can also shoot through walls (a perfect spooky trait).


Also, Brawl Stars has also revealed his new skin called “Cinema Shade,” which you can snag for 29 gems. In this skin, he will have a red hat with a yellow body. He will also wear 3D shades on this skin.

Though the game is not out yet, reviews are, and that's the first good sign to look for when wondering if a game will turn out well. Reviews are mostly very positive, but they don't all agree on everything.

In the time since Dragon Age: Inquisition's release, developer BioWare has released Mass Effect: Andromeda and most recently, Anthem. Depending on who you ask, both of these titles are typically seen as alright at best, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who feels as though either lived up to the typical high-quality standards that BioWare had been known for in the past.


For a quick comparison, The Veilguard gives me serious Dragon Age II vibes, mostly in terms of its combat and gameplay.

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best 3D Sonic game..? Yes.
Holy moly folks, Sega actually did it. After the disappointment of Sonic Forces, the glitchy mess of Sonic Colors Ultimate, and the divisive nature of Sonic Frontiers, the publisher has delivered what is undoubtedly the very best 3D Sonic game yet with Sonic X Shadow Generations. It gracefully revisits a beloved modern classic while introducing an extra campaign that we almost dismissed as a quaint bonus, but actually wound up being the star of the show.
Since some Nintendo fans may not have experienced the console version of 2011’s Sonic Generations (with its release limited to the 3DS), the general gist is that ‘Classic’ and ‘Modern’ versions of the Blue Blur team up to take on an entity known as ‘The Time Eater’ after it merges their timelines and traps them within the mysterious ‘White Space’. The two must revisit iconic stages from the franchise’s history, with Classic Sonic zipping along a 2D plane and Modern Sonic boosting his way across 3D environments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[King Legacy is a Roblox game that is inspired by the popular anime or manga series called “One Piece.” Update 7 has been recently revealed by the developers, and it brings a bunch of new exciting stuff. To give you more details, here is everything new that is in Update 7 of King Legacy.

Now, there is a new level cap, which is 4800.


There are two new islands that are introduced in Update 7. Not only that, a 1v1 friendly PVP is also available on the new island.


A new 3rd Sea Event will spawn randomly in the sea, where you can encounter bosses such as Drakenfyr the Inferno King, Chaos Kraken, Deepsea Crusher, and Abyssal Tyrant.


There are two new Fruit Awakenings: Control V2 and Buddha V2.


Update 7 also brings new items: One new Mythical Accessory, three new Legendary Accessories, and three new Legendary Swords


Update 7 also introduces a new Fruit called Telekinesis, which will replace Human


There are six new Enchant Stones that are being introduced in this update. Here are the names:

Light Stone


Charm Stone


Life Stone


Dark Stone


Spark Stone


Poison Stone




You can use the new Passive Bag Gamepass to store all your Passives in slots. Not only that, you can also name the slot.


This update also brings 82 new Titles with 12 new colors.


Now you can repeat the quest with the new feature called “Quest Repeater.” The catch is that you will only get a 10-second window to do a quest repeat. If the window is closed, you have to talk to the NPC to do the quest again.

Don't insult their intelligence, their divinity, their mastery of the environment and of your emotions. Cats don't need 2-9 player scrambles across the rooms of an eccentric manor house, with customisable outfits and various minigames. What? Jumping Jazz Cats? No. I won't recognise it.

I've figured it out, so here's your comprehensive Mod Conversion guide for Once Human.


How to convert Mods in Once Human


Your first step is to navigate to your mods menu. The fastest way I've found is to simply hit 'K' on your keyboard and then navigate to the mods sub-menu. From here, click on Mod Conversion on the right-hand side of your screen, and you're ready to start converting.

But the word "ambivalent" already exists. So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first Life is Strange game. Sure, I found Max a little bland as a character, but it was still a captivating story I wasn't used to exploring at the time. Now, with Max returning in this direct sequel, I was intrigued to see what's changed.


Now that I've given in to my curiosity and spent around ten hours flying through this latest entry, let's have a quick chat about Life is Strange: Double Exposure. 


Before diving into this, I need to bring up the original Life is Strange again. Although I won't be spoiling Double Exposure here, the game does expect you to have played the prequel and references multiple major plot points from it. I'll avoid spoiling these, too, but I will make direct comparisons to both games with this in mind.

Per Automaton, Kojima recently held a fan Q&A for Anan News, in which he proposed this bizarre scenario. When someone asked him what the most important mindset is for a game creator, Kojima said that they should always strive to make games that are personally satisfying. He also compared game developers with artists whose paintings people appraise even hundreds of years after their deaths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brawl Stars revealed two new brawlers in their recent Brawl Talk. One of the brawlers is Juju, which is a Mythic brawler, available in Artillery class. 


The special thing about her is that she wields elemental powers and can walk on water. This article will provide you with everything you need to know about Juju in Brawl Stars.


Main Attack of Juju in Brawl Stars


Image via Supercell


Juju has three elemental powers: Grass, Water, and Earth. Each elemental power has different effects on the enemies or on Juju. Here are the details of what each elemental power can do:



Water: Slows opponents


Grass: Increases range


Earth: Increases damage



These abilities make Juju versatile in Brawl Stars, as the earth attack will inflict 2000 damage to the enemies, while the grass attack deals a maximum of 1600 damage per hit. The water attack slows down the enemy and will inflict only 1280 damage.


Super of Juju in Brawl Stars


Juju summons her voodoo doll called Gris-Gris, which chases the enemies to throw needles at them. What’s even better is that this doll also comes with a shield that gradually wears off with time, as seen in the Brawl Talk video. However, the complete details on Gris-Gris are still gray, and we will soon update the article once the brawler is released.


When does Juju come out in Brawl Stars?


Juju is set to debut in Brawl Stars on October 30, 2024. Not only that, Juju will also receive a skin called “Unlucky Juju” once the Angels vs Demons season commences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies is filled with classic one-liners, but Carver's unexpected and delightful reference to the beloved SpongeBob SquarePants series is the one that takes the cake.


In Zombies mode, Carver will mention, "Wanna see how fast I can reload? Wanna see it again?" The minute I heard this line, I already knew what he was poking fun at, especially as someone who quotes SpongeBob religiously. This dialogue is a nod to the show's iconic Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V episode, where the cast transcends into a Justice League-like ensemble.




SpongeBob, in particular, is the one Carver references, specifically when our favorite sponge states, "Wanna see me run to the mountain and back? You wanna see me do it again?" Carver, of course, does his own version of it, and it's surprising to see such a hilarious line end up in a highly stressful mode like Zombies.


I never thought my two worlds would clash, but I'm all for it. And, if you want to unlock this line for yourself, it tends to happen whenever Carver sips on one of the Perk Colas.


Carver's nod to SpongeBob SquarePants isn't his only memorable line. He's got a lot more than that, mostly involving a smattering of curse words hurled at the zombies. It's made me laugh more than a few times, and now, Carver has become one of my favorite Operators because of it.


There are likely many more funny references to find in Black Ops 6. In fact, a player has found one regarding another show, Brooklyn 99, with a "Stop stealing my yogurt! - Terry" Post-it. I can't wait to see what other shows the game will mention, giving us a whole lot of Easter Eggs to discover.

How to get Automatic Parts in Once Human


To get Automatic Parts, you'll need to go out into higher-level areas and collect scraps from enemies, the environment, storage crates, and containers. You will then have to disassemble these scrapes at the Disassembly Bench to actually get the Automatic parts. 


Rarely, you can find Automatic Parts in the wild, but your primary source will be from disassembling scraps.

Pretty cool! But like anything cool these days, it comes with a massive caveat: the remastered cutscenes are full of AI hallucinations.


Remastering old video is probably one of the more benign uses of AI, specifically when it comes to upscaling. It uses the technology’s pattern duplication to simply guess what an image was supposed to look like and generates it automatically. It likely won’t ever be as good as a human’s guess, but it can be a reasonable shortcut. Companies (as well as fans) in charge of remastering old games and movies have used it, but often, they touch up the AI’s output by …]]></summary>

Some in the UK may know comedy TV personality Adam Buxton, who was once the counterpart of Joe Cornish in the Adam and Joe Show (1996-2001), and, as recently as 2020, was still guesting on popular Channel 4 panel shows. Nowadays, he's more well-known for The Adam Buxton Podcast, but in 1999 he walked into a London-based video game store where I was working as staff, and, retrieving a copy of Raiden DX from the Japanese PlayStation section, asked if I was familiar with it. I told him if he liked the series, it was by far the best entry and a superb arcade port full of bells and whistles. He immediately handed over the cash, wished me a good day, and left. I didn’t bother to say, “hey buddy, I watch you on TV”, but I was impressed with his gaming choice.
Raiden, you see, is like a secret handshake amongst the shooting game hardcore, a distinguished Masonic-like fraternity of middle-aged men who get enthusiastic about blowing things up with spaceships. It’s known by many, but played seriously by few, and since its debut in 1990 its myriad sequels have been largely overlooked by the mainstream. Regardless, it’s an excellent series, from the Raiden Fighters spinoffs to the newer polygonal sequels. So, why the celebrity flex? Well, it left an impression. Not just because it was Adam Buxton, whose TV show was popular at the time, but because I never forgot that Adam Buxton was both a shoot-em-up player and Raiden fan. That was cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Let's cut right to the chase. The 'Complete' app will set you back an 'Early discounted price' of $9.99 / £8.99 until 31st Jan 2025, before resorting to its regular price of $19.99 / £17.99. Nintendo states this is a one-time flat-fee payment with "no in-game purchases for items".

Decade is a fascinating adventure game that drew me in with its apparent vagueness but then, like some sort of considerate, sensible coward, went on to explain itself well in on its Steam page.
It’s the end of the world, and you’re not too happy about it, so you’ll be shoving children in a time machine with little more than a rotting Lunchly and some instructions to help you figure out exactly what went wrong.
What are you dressing as for Halloween? Me, I’m dressing as someone trying to bring back “tray-tray” in an effort to give Edwin a seizure. Here’s the tray-tray:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlimited POWAAAAAAH.
Love it or hate it, Zelda: Breath of the Wild's weapon durability is one of the game's most interesting features, forcing players to mix up their offensive strategies at all times.
What if you just can't be bothered with all of that nonsense, though? Well, we here at Nintendo Life quite like switching up our weapons on the fly, but if you'd rather just stick with one and be done with it, Gaming Reinvented's method to obtain what it calls the 'Ultra Obliterator' might be worth investigating.

Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the AACS were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish "online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings".
Last Friday, as per a statement released by the VGHF and spotted by PC Gamer, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.

Even when I'm writing about happy, upbeat games, I'm actually writing about horror games. I'm worried that if I double-down further on morbidity I might foul the Maw's humours and give it jaundice. So let's see if we can satiate the creature with some nice, breezy open worlders and RPGs instead. I'll throw in a single horror game just to keep up appearances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-orders now live.
It was during the August 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase that we got our first look at Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer. As we rapidly approach its 5th December release date (god, is it that late in the year already?), Nintendo has released a new overview trailer showing us what to expect from the latest entry in the Fitness Boxing series — spoilers: it's more hunky instructors.
On the gameplay front, this one offers up a couple of different game modes to hopefully appeal to every boxercise fan out there. There are personal workouts with Light, Regular and Heavy difficulty settings, Quick Workout for those who want to leap straight into the action, Mitt Drills for throwing punches at your own pace and even Sit Fit Boxing to work up a sweat without standing.

The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Damned if ya do.
When it was announced back in 2010, Shadows Of The Damned seemed too good to be true. A supergroup of creators teaming up to make a game in the genre they helped define. Shinji Mikami, father of the Resident Evil franchise, joining Suda51, one of Japanese game development's most unique voices. Akira Yamaoka, beloved composer of the Silent Hill series, was also on board. How could this possibly not be another survival horror masterpiece?
Unfortunately, publisher demands twisted their collaboration into something more commercially viable. Starting as a traditional horror experience called Kurayami, Grasshopper Manufacture's anticipated title ended up being a gonzo shooter in which Mikami and Suda’s signature was diluted. A flawed yet enjoyable experience that has since garnered a cult following, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered joins Suda 51’s Lollipop Chainsaw RePop as a flawed yet enjoyable Switch remaster.

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.

If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM's Global Main Menu.

He's got assault rifles and comparison screenshots poking out of his ribcage, which are making an absolute mess of the hallway plaster. He says he is Call Of Duty Man, and he is here to let me know about Black Ops 6's day one patch. The new Activision FPS is out tomorrow 25th October, I gather. Call Of Duty Man speaks only in three-syllable bursts and rolling bombardments, but I think if I listen carefully I can make out the highlights. Here's what that patch involves, in nickel-plated bulletpoint form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zotac are one of the better graphics card makers of the post-EVGA era, so even as the early pangs of handheld gaming PC fatigue start to creep in, I’ve been keeping a hopeful eye on the Zotac Zone. This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montpellier's Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

Wilmot's Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi. This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.

I know nothing about the Velvet Revolution, but I do have some quick thoughts on the use of a format I associate with Where's Wally to capture a process of extraordinary political change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as… jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.
It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gangstalk is a cat-and-mouse game in which you play both cat and mouse. It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked. By you. Yes, I too am wearing an expression of puppy-eyed dismay and confusion. But it sounds interesting, sufficiently interesting that I can disregard the very loud DYSTOPIAN WORLD framing in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're fondly dreaming of an actual Steam Deck 2, not some half-and-half OLED travesty, you should also be fondly dreaming of a better class of battery. Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been mega substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.

On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-building" and "survival" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a climactic scene of the original Final Fantasy VII, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadlock gives me the shakes. Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets. You'll get into hectic scrapes with a giant blob man and come out of it sweating and swearing, and possibly alive. It is tactical, deep, instinctive, and an interesting work-in-progress. It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

Such a failure of cable management pierces my conscience like the beat of Poe's tell-tale heart, and yet I’m forever powerless – as in, I can’t be bothered – to do anything about it. Yet even I was soothed by the Steam Next Fest demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out puzzle game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind Gone Home, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.

Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, RPG, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of Red Faction, Frostpunk, and Sunless Sea that have me interested.

For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[City of London Police say a man was arrested this week as part of an operation to disrupt the supply of pirate IPTV subscriptions in the UK. After targeting a residential address and four business addresses in the West Midlands, police say a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of copyright and money laundering offenses. Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. That's the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, you will not have to worry about getting preyed upon by rival Space Marine chapters whilst duffing up the Tyranids, for there are no plans to add a PvPvE mode to Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The allure of the sea-green GameBoy screen is difficult to resist. Picking up from where Pokémon left off two decades ago, Letalis is a bleepy-bloopy retro RPG about wandering from town to town and doing battle with dodgy local leaders to prove your worth. But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket.

FATHER TO NO MURDERED SONS. HUSBAND OF NO MURDERED WIVES. OWNER OF A BRONZE SWIMMING CERTIFICATE AND A WHITE BELT IN KARATE. Eater of pizza that has fallen on the floor, like a whole minute ago! And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Hah, it's much easier to make that last claim in a video game, rather than when standing in a literal circle of swords. The game in question is Dieseldome: Oil And Blood, and it is pretty good fun. There's a demo on Steam, for now is the time of Next Fest.

This is why I like the demo for first-person shooter Cop Bastard a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest Steam Next Fest - out right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last October, Paradox Interactive announced that they and development studio Harebrained Schemes were breaking up, following underwhelming sales of Harebrained's 1930s-set XCOMlike, The Lamplighters League. The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

You are the lone engineer on a rustbucket submarine exploring the dangerous waters of a submerged country in an alternate reality 1990s. The warning lights on the control panel are flashing, a buzzer is spluttering like a dying bluebottle, and your robotic assistant is about as useful as an umbrella in the Mariana Trench. Things could not get any worse. And then you see it. Something in the green haze outside. Something with a tail.
