        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, it was announced that hit anime Kaiju No. 8 would be getting its own video game tie-in. While this is no doubt something fans have wanted for a while, some of the initial hype seems to have quickly died down given the game will be free-to-play, sparking assumptions that it will be another typical gacha game.


Granted, the announcement trailer nor the press release give any hint as to what the actual gameplay will be like. However, developer Akatsuki Games is responsible for several other gacha games, like Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle and Atelier Resleriana, so it's not unreasonable to assume Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME will follow suit. As such, some of the responses from fans on Reddit haven't been the most positive.

On 29th May 2024, Apogee Entertainment launched Quest Master via Early Access on Steam, and though it may be some time before the final product releases on the Switch, that hasn't stopped Nintendo fans from living out their 'Zelda Maker' fantasies.
In case you're unaware, the game essentially allows you to unleash your imagination and create unique, themed dungeons while boasting gorgeous pixel art visuals and gameplay reminiscent of classic Zelda games. It was confirmed for Switch during last year's Guerilla Collective showcase, but for now, developer Skydevilpalm is hard at work polishing the game via Early Access.

If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.

Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game that closely follows the events of Wu Cheng’en’s seminal novel Journey to the West. The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes.

As DBDLeague Season 9 continues through June, the official body recently issued a statement explaining that Team Tremor, one of the competing teams, had been disqualified. To be clear, the official statement says that Team Tremor was disqualified for quitting the league's voice chat and failing to rejoin within the given time limit. All this came about, though, because of a bug and the referee ruling around it.

It's easy to get yourself into a groove with one particular weapon, Stratagem, or loadout in Helldivers 2. For example, the Flamethrower is so powerful against Terminids that there's almost no reason to deviate from it. that is, unless you get a Personal Order to use something else, like the Autocannon, or you get a comment from a fellow Helldiver and want to broaden your horizons before your dependency causes your dependents to have to pay to have your helmet shipped home.

Well now the Paldeck videos, released every weekend over on Twitter and YouTube, are providing deeper glimpses at some of those Pals.


On June 16, in what seems like a wonderful Father’s Day gift to Palworld-playing Dads everywhere, Pocketpair showed off one of the Pals which has become a secure fan favorite — Croajiro. 


Meet the newest water type Pal in Palworld, Croajiro




In the Paldeck video, the little frog-like creature, obviously a Water type Pal although it’s unknown whether it is a dual-type, can be seen facing off against another new Pal, Chillet Ignis. The Fire type Chillet Ignis was shown off yesterday, June 15, in the other of this weekend's Paldeck videos. 


It’s nice to see that we’re finally being given sneak peaks rather than recaps of Pals we’ve already become very accustomed to, as all previous Paldeck videos have been for Pals which we already know and have likely captured. 


Croajiro's attacks

Among the scenes in Croajiro’s Paldeck video were attacks which are very familiar from other Water type Pals, as well as what we can expect when Croajiro is petted. The best part of the Paldeck happened at the end, though, with Croajiro casually wielding its stick against four Mossanda, killing them effortlessly. I doubt it will be that easy in-game, but it’s a fun image.


We were given a sneak peak of the next Paldeck video, too. Next week, on June 24, we’ll find out more about Katress Ignis. Though we already know it’s a Fire type, I’m interested to see what else we may gather from the Paldeck.

You’d be forgiven for overlooking the Latin American Games Showcase last weekend. Let’s face it, with over a dozen unique showcases over the span of a few days, it is unlikely most audiences will catch them all, particularly when the shows are each focused on a specific niche.




But this show in particular was littered with beautiful works and inventive concepts, a description no less fitting of the presentation’s final game, Mariachi Legends from Halberd Studios, which was unveiled at last year's PC Gaming Show.

Seeing anything Star Wars-related requiring more than one second after its release to gather an avalanche of negative reactions nowadays is already pretty surprising, but this story gets even better. It turns out that the review bombing campaign pretty much ignored the actual Star Wars Acolyte TV series, and accidentally ended up hitting other works whose creators were unlucky enough to name after the word "Acolyte".




The biggest victim is a 2008 Thriller called Acolytes, which is now sitting at 35% Audience Score after a barrage of negative SW-related ramblings.

According to a rough translation, he's now finished recording the final episode. Just don't expect to see it any time soon, as it will apparently be a while before it's released.
Until then, you can continue to enjoy his regular uploads like his most recent video focused on attack collision in games. Throughout his channel's lifespan, he's also shared plenty of other tips and insights about game design - covering areas such as sound, graphics, controls, animation, and various other interesting topics related to this subject.

Ahead of the Founder's Packs going live and players flooding the servers, developer Mainframe Industries invited me to take a look at the game and get a sense of its vision. 


Calling Pax Dei an MMO would be underselling it. Once players load into the game, they're able to choose their server, which is a chunk of the 400 square kilometer space available at launch. Each server or shard is a place where players can work together to build a settlement, but not in the traditional way you might think.

While they come with an audience built in, game-inspired series have to do more than simply appeal to fans of the original medium. They've got to attract longtime fans and lorehounds, all while simultaneously telling a story that can be understood by the uninitiated. 


While the task is difficult, it isn't impossible. The Fallout TV show has shown itself to be a perfect example in this regard, earning praise from critics, Fallout fans, and general viewers alike. But what is it about the show that accomplishes what so many adaptions can't? The secret sauce lies within a few of its classic narrative techniques, cleverly working in faithful nods to its source while creating a world for the general audience.

Books obviously come in many different sizes, but did you know that there’s an obscure law that dictates the legal limit for how long a novel can be? It’s measured in ‘George Martins’. If your story is more than three ‘Georges’ wide, you’re swiftly escorted to a cell and made to eat any bits of book that reference more than three characters in a scene with the same surname. This week, it's developer and writer of the legendarily good Radiator Blog, Robert Yang! Cheers Robert! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

With the commencement of the European championships in Germany, many cards are now eligible for upgrades over the next few weeks.

EA FC 24 Path to Glory tier list


The EA FC 24 Path to Glory tier list divides all the available cards into several groups. I have used five sub-groups: S, A, B, C, and D.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the release of the Skyline Valley update for Fallout 76, players quickly noticed that scrapping Pickaxes resulted in Legendary modules. This obvious glitch has fans on the hunt for these previously mediocre but now extremely valuable weapons.


Pickaxe spawns have been temporarily disabled


Screenshot by Destructoid


Unfortunately for players hoping to get some easy Legendary modules, this exploit was busting the economy of Fallout 76. Bethesda released a hotfix to temporarily disable Pickaxes from spawning in the world. This also means that if you have the blueprint to craft a Pickaxe, you’ll get a “lack the requirements” message when you try to make one.


However, even after the hotfix, Pickaxes still appear in some locations, and they occasionally drop from Scorched enemies as well. Here are the places you’ll want to check out to find a Pickaxe after the hotfix:



Foundation – Exterior


Gauley Mine


Glassed Cavern


Nuka World On Tour – Tunnel of Love



Where to find Pickaxes in Fallout 76 normally


Screenshot by Destructoid


If you want a Pickaxe because you’re a completionist and need to collect every weapon in the game, you might want to know all the places you can find them in normal circumstances. In addition to the above locations, Pickaxes usually spawn in the following areas:



Blackwater Mine


Garrahan Mining Headquarters


Greg’s Mine Supply


Lucky Hole Mine


Miners Monument


Tygart Wastewater Treatment Plant 



Though Pickaxes can currently still be found in Fallout 76 even after the hotfix, it’s only a matter of time before Bethesda notices the oversight and also disables those spawn locations or patches the Legendary module glitch. So if you’re hoping for some easy looting, you might want to hurry.

If players have spent some time combing through Destiny 2's endgame content, there's little doubt they've encountered one of the mysterious shrouded statues. These fixtures have been an enigma since their first appearance in-game, with little to no explanation about the origin or purpose of the identical structures. However, in The Final Shape, Guardians finally get some answers about these creepy statues.


The shrouded statues first appeared in the Shadowkeep expansion, found throughout the campaign and at the very end of the Garden of Salvation Raid.

Square Enix's SaGa Emerald Beyond might not have received the same amount of attention as certain other JRPGs this year, but months after its release Square Enix is still showing support for the game with some updates.
The "major content" in this latest one addresses multiple bugs and also includes some quality of life improvements. Here are the full patch notes:

Yacht Club Games spent most of its recent broadcast digging into Shovel Knight's upcoming games and DLC, but there was also a brief update in there about the company's new action-adventure game Mina The Hollower, which draws inspiration from series like The Legend of Zelda.
Apart from a new video (above) showcasing once again what players can expect in this new adventure, the game's director Alec Faulkner shared some extra insight about this new 8-bit handheld-style adventure running at a smooth 60 frames per second.

From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline. 


Not counting Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which is due to come out later this year, the Life is Strange series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the Life is Strange games in chronological order.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

Now that The Dark Ages has been announced, id Software's iconic series is once again in the public eye.


Although, it never really stopped being part of the wider gaming conversation. As a series, Doom has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it's stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.

As part of Shovel Knight's 10th anniversary celebrations, Yacht Club Games will be going back to where it started, with the original game Shovel of Hope - only this time it's getting the 'DX' treatment! You might remember a few titles of yesteryear getting the same treatment after their initial run and now we've got Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX.
This is a new "enhanced edition" of Shovel Knight's adventure that started it all. Apart from Steam, no other platforms have been confirmed (but a Nintendo release seems highly likely given the series' history) and we don't have a release date just yet, but we do know that it's "coming soon", so hopefully there's not long to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fashionably late.
Yes, yes - we know Nintendo Switch is old now. There comes a time in each console's life when the games start to dry up and we look to the future, and the Switch is very much in the autumn of its years. Back in May, two months into its eighth year, Nintendo said a new hardware announcement is coming at some point before April next year, and with that acknowledgement comes a sense that the really good stuff will be saved to launch the next console with a bang.
However, looking back at past Nintendo systems, it doesn't necessarily mean Switch will be running on fumes for the rest of the year. You would have been forgiven for thinking Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the Switch's last hurrah, and then Super Mario Bros. Wonder turned up. You may have thought the release of Switch in 2017 meant that the might 3DS' days of quality exclusive software were numbered, but as we'll highlight below, that wasn't the case. In fact, Nintendo has good form when it comes to putting out brilliant games at the very end of a console's lifecycle and having sold over 140 million Switches, there's a high chance that there's still gold in them first-party hills, as well as all the third-party stuff we already know about.

The Switch has an extensive library of games covering all sorts of franchises and while it's got plenty of Final Fantasy titles nowadays, one game still missing in this particular series is Square Enix's massive (and highly successful) multiplayer role-playing game Final Fantasy XIV Online. So will we ever see it on a Nintendo system?
Game director and producer Naoki Yoshida (also known as Yoshi-P) was recently asked by Easy Allies about the possibility of a Nintendo release and mentioned how he wants to see the game available on as many devices as possible in the long run. This apparently includes Nintendo's hardware, and at the rate it's going, the new target could potentially be the Switch's "successor".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

The debate about which is the best football video game is one that has raged on for decades.
Until now, there hasn’t really been much of a choice on Switch. There’s EA Sports FC (which thankfully, finally, is worth getting now), but with Konami’s eFootball (formerly PES) nowhere in sight, the other options are arcade-style indie games whose quality varies wildly.

Our Adventurer Guild is cheerfully simple in appearance, and its turn-based fights and griddy missions establish its parts at once as familiar, potentially even by-the-numbers. But those parts are arranged into an original and deceptively detailed mercenary management game that got harder to put down the longer I played.

In amongst the press releases, indie nuggets, and the occasional pitch for sponsored AI content (no, never), something truly exquisite occasionally peeks through the chest lid. This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct," the Dual Rulers announcement reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer."
Here's a look at Dual Rulers' key art:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi "Suda51" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has "auto rock on," an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

Japanese developer M2, known for its work on Castlevania Advance Collection, Legend of Mana, and the superb Dodonpachi DaiOuJou Blissful Death Re:Incarnation, has stated that it wants to bring more of its games to the Nintendo Switch.
Speaking to Touch Arcade, M2's CEO and founder Naoki Horii confirmed that the studio is "always looking for that opportunity" to release more games on the Switch. He also later clarified, however, that "there are so many things I want to do compared to what I can actually do", which likely means that Switch owners may have to make do without a few titles, despite M2's best efforts.

14th June 2024 marks the 30th anniversary of Donkey Kong for the Game Boy's Japanese release. It's one of the finest games on the system and a hybrid arcade port/spin-off that ushered in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series which recently came to Switch.
In honour of the occasion, we thought we'd highlight this 2020 video examining the game made by erstwhile NL YouTube chap and all-'round good bloke Jon Cartwright. Here's hoping Nintendo adds this to the Switch Online GB lineup soon. Enjoy!

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet on the upcoming launch of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition. However, the discovery of the game's trophies via Exophase (thanks, VGC) may indicate that its release is just around the corner.
It would make sense too, right? With Nintendo confirming a Direct showcase to be aired at some point this month, Beyond Good & Evil feels like the perfect game to crop up during the presentation. Ubisoft also confirmed that it would be released in 'early 2024', but since we're arguably well beyond that point now, we feel it could drop on the Switch eShop at any point.

The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…]]></summary>

When I first played Astro's Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game's short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay. 
The story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange. Max has moved far away from Arcadia Bay for a fresh start and now works as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University in upstate Vermont. She has sworn to never use her time-rewind ability again, and hasn't since the first game's conclusion. Despite this, Max’s power has evolved.

However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

        <updated>2024-06-13T12:47:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2023, Larian Studios’ award-winning game Baldur’s Gate 3 filled a void in RPG fans’ hearts. As of last year, BioWare, the developer behind Dragon Age and Mass Effect, hadn’t released an RPG in six years. Larian’s take on the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset checked off a lot of boxes for fans who wanted a party-driven…

It’s fair to assume that you might’ve forgotten what happened during the last Dragon Age game, or some of the specific choices you made back in the misty ages of 2014. Whether you remember or not, this year’s long-awaited sequel Dragon Age: The Veilguard should have you covered, with the ability to carry over your story choices from the previous game and get a refresher on what happened last time around.

I have no idea where the game came from - a dream, perhaps - but 30 years later, I still think about it as a perfectly formed way to lose hours on the PC without actually doing anything.

I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

Citizen Sleeper took me by surprise in 2022, giving me a rare new video game experience, both mechanically and narratively, and my dice-centric role-playing adventure has stuck with me since. I still think about my Sleeper and what they're up to now. In a year where Elden Ring didn't release, it would have been my game of the year with a bullet – read my Citizen Sleeper review here to find out why. Now, a little more than two years later, I've played parts of the opening hour of Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector and find myself desperate to play more. It brings bac…]]></summary>

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole. It only makes sense that in revisiting such a r…]]></summary>

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.”

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.
Taking place in the fantasy kingdom of Euchronia, Metaphor tells the tale of …]]></summary>

If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.
A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid strategy antics of Metal Slug Tactics ever since it was first announced. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

FACEMINER captures both of these things well, as it sees you build a biometric data processing empire from scratch.

I mean, I went from, "Hmmm, this is dubious", to a sicko excited by the fact I didn't have to click much to harvest strangers' portraits.

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

You can read our extensive preview breaking down these sequences here, or you can watch how each of these assassins use their respective talents to relieve enemies of their lives in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed has been threatening to go to Japan for so long that I think the idea has lost its thunder, but I’ll admit to a squee of enthusiasm, during our first look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows, when deuteragonist Naoe grappled onto the ceiling to allow a castle guard to pass innocently beneath. I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.


It opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Divine Trials" DLC is now available to all players for free, and it brings with it revisited boss fights, puzzle and platforming challenges, new amulets and outfits, and more. Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below: 


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hit PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC back in January, and it's one of our favorite games of the year. Read why in Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here. After that, check out these four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the Metroidvania genre right, and then watch our guide on how to beat the game's hardest platforming challenge.

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

Metal Slug made its name as a fast-paced, run-and-gun explosive arcade shooter, making it all the more surprising how well it seemingly fits into a slower, turn-based strategy format. Since Metal Slug Tactics’ reveal at the final E3 in 2021, both series fans and tactics aficionados have been waiting with bated breath to get their hands on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

It's not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That's about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don't worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.
Give a look to the trailer to get a better understanding of how the game plays.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This month, Dragon Age: The Veilguard (you read that right – Dreadwolf is no more) graces the cover of Game Informer. After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year. 
We visited BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more. We also spoke to many of the game's leads about the name change, th…]]></summary>

There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we received an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in Treyarch's popular, long-running subseries to one of gaming's biggest franchises. As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series. This subseries, which debuted in 2010, focuses on historical time periods and conspiracies surrounding them, creating narratives ripe with intri…]]></summary>

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has released a new trailer for Diablo IV's upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion, and its looks gorgeously horrific. This trailer also reveals the expansion hits Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 8.
In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred's opening cinematic. If you're curious about what to expect, give it a watch – otherwise, it's likely the cinematic that will play at the start of the expansion later this year when Vessel of Hatred hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Check it out for yourself in the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred cinematic below: 


Pre-purchasing the expansion will give players instant rewards in the game.

We still don’t have a release date, despite signs we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.

It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that Starfield was getting its first expansion later this year, but tonight's Xbox Games Showcase gave us its first trailer. My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Door-and-peace-minus-the-peace FPS Anger Foot, the best game ever made, has finally got a release date: July 11th 2024. This is spectacular news, mainly because I’d already printed off a load of shirts that said ‘Anger Foot GOTY 2024.’ I was going to do some socks, too, but I do not trust this game anywhere near footwear.

In the terrifying tidal wave of trailers that continually washes over us this weekend, they send word of a new game via the Devolver Direct. Possessor(s) is a side-scrolling character action game of mysterious sci-fi horror set in a "quarantined city ripped apart and flooded by an interdimensional catastrophe". This is coming on top of the already-announced Hyper Light Breaker. Please, Heart Machine, pace yourselves. I barely have time to play the daily crossword.

Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished.
