        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across the multiverse.
We had high hopes for Trinity Fusion after playing it at PAX East two years ago, and we’re happy to say, it doesn’t disappoint. The concept is great. A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.
You play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump. And Kera can launch enemies into the air and perform air combos. Everything’s better with air combos.

A little while back, Retro Game Books offered up an unofficial Metroid pixel art eBook for absolutely nothing. The deal was valid for an exceptionally limited time, so if you happened to miss out, then you're in luck. As announced by creator Brian Riggsbee on social media, the Pixel Art Metroid eBook is free once again.
You'll need to be pretty quick, though, as the offer, which is to coincide with the 38th anniversary of the original NES title, is only applicable until 9th August at 11:59pm PT (so that's 10th August at 07:59am BST for those in the UK).

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment introduced a whole new map for players to explore with the release of E-District, their take on a cyberpunk playground. E-District is Apex Legends’ first-ever night map, and it arrives with a new game mode where players automatically respawn the moment they’re eliminated.


Currently, only the trios revival mode is available in Apex Legends, with no duos mode in sight (much to the frustration of some players). E-District was also the only map you could get into when Season 22 launched, but Respawn Entertainment accidentally removed E-District from the rotation pool for ranked games.




Respawn has now put out a statement, announcing that E-District has been added back, but with a catch. Apex Legends players will only get to queue up for ranked games in E-District from August 9 onwards, and this map exclusivity will remain in place until August 12.


After August 12, Apex Legends ranked games will once again operate on a rotational basis with ranked games taking place on Broken Moon, Storm Point, and E-District maps.




This extended duration could help players get more accustomed to the new map’s POIs and figure out rotational plays that can help last longer during ranked games. And with new akimbo weapons in the mix, E-District looks to be the right playground to get used to dual-wielding the likes of P2020 and Mozambique.


Apex Legends Season 22, titled Shockwave, launched on August 6, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends Shockwave Season 22 is live now, and it brings a new map among other additions to the game. Among those new features is the introduction of Akimbo weapons mode. This refers to the dual wielding of weapons in Apex Legends, where you have certain weapons in both of your hands to deal damage.


Even though akimbo weapons are fun to use in Apex Legends, there are some things to keep in mind about using two P2020s or two Mozambique together. There are certain buffs and nerfs attached to these combinations. For starters, weapons in akimbo mode turn into automatic weapons, meaning you can just hold onto that trigger and the weapon would continue to fire.


There are no optics available when weapons are in akimbo mode, so you only have the option to hipfire these weapons. To make up for this, Apex Legends players who wish to re-enable optics can holster the second weapon by using the select fire toggle input.

Respawn has added an increased rate of fire and has doubled the magazine size for akimbo weapons. However, there will be a longer reload time (since you have to reload two weapons at the same time). Given that akimbo operates in hipfire mode, looking down sights by aiming will slightly reduce the hipfire spread, so even if there is no optic in place, players shouldn’t forget to aim down sights for better accuracy.


So far, akimbo mode is available only for the P2020 pistol and Mozambique shotgun, making it possible to have two P2020s or two Mozambiques in battle. Akimbo weapons have added a whole new layer to how battles happen in Apex Legends, and while there are only two weapons so far that you can dual-wield, we will perhaps one day get to wield even two Wingman together.

The live-action Borderlands movie arrives in cinemas this week and the first impressions are now being shared online. We've rounded up some of these posts to see how it's being received so far.
Admittedly, it doesn't seem to be going down very well, with some suggesting it could be the "worst movie" of 2024, but there are some more positive reactions floating about. This new adventure features an all-star cast made up of Cate Blanchette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart and Jack Black as Claptrap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the standard Worn Tools can serve you well initially, upgrading your materials is crucial to collect more advanced items. This includes Iron Ore, a resource that can be quite challenging to locate. We're here to guide you on where to find Iron Ore in Fields of Mistria and what requirements are needed.


Fields of Mistria Iron Ore farming guide


To obtain Iron Ore in Fields of Mistria, you'll need to venture to Level 21 and beyond in the Mines. A barrier will block your path to this level, which you can overcome by unlocking the Water Seal with a few specific ingredients. Collecting a Ruby, Lantern Moth, Stone Loach, and Upper Mines Mushroom will grant you access to the area.

Before you go off into the Mines, ensure to bring a lot of stamina resources to reach the higher levels. The Full Restore spell can be excellent for this, as well as the Stamina Syrup from Valen's Clinic. You may want to pick up some healing remedies, too, just in case an enemy comes knocking at your door.


Once you've unlocked the Mines Level 21 in Fields of Mistria, use a Copper Pickaxe to mine the Iron Ores. Treasure chests and digging spots also provide more of this resource, spawning a whole bundle.


If you have some money to spare, you can purchase Iron Ore and other materials at the Blacksmith's Shop. Balor's Wagon occasionally has Iron Ingots, but they cost 300 Tesserae. With enough resources, you can upgrade your tools and expand their charging range. Additionally, Iron Ingots can be used during the Repair the General Store quest, which will be unlocked during the game's later stages.

The Episode quietly delivered a secret world boss encounter to Nessus, rewarding Radiolite and two Triumphs. However, before players can test themselves against the encounter, they'll have to complete several prior steps that involve the seasonal story and the new Battlegrounds.


Though Destiny 2 has shed its seasons for episodes, content and structure have initially appeared pretty consistent between the two models. Typically, alongside narrative missions and seasonal activities, a given Season (and now Episode) will hide a few secrets that lead to hidden encounters (like the Whetstone Exotic mission).

But there's a catch (of course). Fortnite Battle Pass items won't appear in the Fortnite Store for 18 months after the pass expires. 


It's not the only catch. In the announcement from developer Epic Games, not all items in a Battle Pass will appear in the store after the time limit expires. 


"Shop selection is dependent on a variety of factors, and there is no guarantee that a Battle Pass item will come to the Shop after this change goes into effect," Epic explains in a Q&A. "If an item in a future Battle Pass will never be available outside the Pass, we’ll let you know!" Rough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Morel Mushroom is one of the rarest ingredients in Fields of Mistria, typically only spawning in a select few locations. Fortunately, there are two ways to obtain this particular item, and we're here to show you what needs to be done.


Where to find Morel Mushrooms in Fields of Mistria


You can find Morel Mushrooms in The Narrows and the Beach during the Spring. They also appear in Balor's Wagon, where they can be purchased for 100 Tesserae each. If you want to get them for free, look around the riverside of The Narrows. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


I spotted one of them up above the Mine's entrance; however, this can only be accessed after completing the Beautification Project.


Screenshot by Destructoid


In addition to the Narrows, some players have discovered the Morel Mushroom next to the lighthouse at the Beach. Unfortunately, they aren't guaranteed to spawn here, but you can at least try to look here daily.


Since Morel Mushrooms are incredibly rare in Fields of Mistria, I highly recommend waiting for them at Balor's Wagon. Regardless of the current season, they'll eventually appear in the shop's Forageables section. Those who don't see them in Balor's inventory will likely need to wait a few days. This shop's selection changes daily, so keep checking it while entering Mistria.


You can cook the mushrooms and create recipes for stamina and health. In addition to meals, they can be donated to the museum or given to a villager upon request. Romanceable characters like Juniper also enjoy Morel Mushrooms as a gift, improving relationship levels in return.

Since March is the town's local blacksmith, he's all about having free ores to make his job easier. While regular ores will still make him happy, perfect versions are where you'll really elicit a reaction, especially if you save your gifts for his birthday on Spring 16.

How to unlock a pet in Diablo 4


The easiest way to unlock and gain access to your first pet in Diablo 4 is to head to Kyovashad. Look at the northern area of Kyovashad and you should have a quest from...well, a Well Behaved Dog.

When you get to Khaz Algar, it might not be a bad idea to look a little more diplomatic and casual. Showing up in a full suit of armor might give the wrong message to potential new allies, you know? There's no better way to get the best in casual gear than on August 16. It's Free T-Shirt Day! Look for NPCs walking through your capital cities and shooting free shirts out of a canon for anyone to pick up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mastering the insane mobility available to you in Mecha BREAK is imperative if you want to be competitive. One of the most powerful, yet obscured, mobility options available to you is Fast Landing, and I'll explain here how you too can use it.


How to use Fast Landing in Mecha BREAK


Fast Landing is a mechanic that allows you to plunge downward to the ground from any verticle position. All mecha in Mecha BREAK can perform it, but thanks to it not being highlighted in the game's tutorial, it's easy to miss such a powerful tool. So, to do a Fast Landing, simply hit ALT by default. Doing so while airborne in any capacity will see you perform a Fast Landing.


The biggest reason why you'd want to use a Fast Landing is for hasty repositioning. There's nothing worse than being caught airborne while a Narukami is scoping you out. You're the very definition of a sit-and-duck in such a scenario, but with Fast Landing, you can easily escape it. 


In a similar scope, Fast Landing is also extremely good at breaking enemy lock-ons and general targeting because of just how fast you can reach the dirt from any verticle position. The landing is so quick that it was incredibly difficult for me to even get a screenshot of it in action.

Now, imagine you're trying to aim at someone who decided to use a Fast Landing behind a skyscraper on Gracelynn Skycity. Let's just say that nothing you can do will catch them in the act. You're losing that lock, which is precisely why Fast Landing is so strong. I've found it especially powerful for Falcon and Skyraider because of their natural ability to transform and reposition thanks to their jet transformations.


If you want to stay competitive in Mecha BREAK, mastering Fast Landing is a must. Its blinding speed and exceptional positioning power make it a game-changer. You'll be amazed at the intense engagements you can survive just by utilizing this skill effectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's female artistic swimming team brought video games into the spotlight at the 2024 Olympics this past Tuesday by performing to the tune of Nier: Automata's OST. 


The Japanese team used "A Beautiful Song" as a part of their highly energetic freeform dance routine, and came just six points short of winning a medal.


The beautiful happening was noticed by Emi Evans, the singer who'd originally lent her vocals to the OST:




And the event didn't go unnoticed by Yoko Taro, the creator of the Nier series himself, who responded by, well, making his face on Twitter.




This is not the first time that Nier: Automata makes an appearance at the Olympics. The opening ceremony of Tokyo's 2020 Olympics also featured one of the game's fantastic songs:




You can totally see that the generation currently competing at the Olympics has games in its DNA, as evidenced by Noah Lyle, the already legendary runner destroys the competition while keeping Yu-Gi-Oh!  cards under his equipment.




Gymnast Casimir Schmidt also proudly displays tattoos of Mew and Toad on his huge arms.




This isn't even the first time a video game's OST shows up at the artistic swimming competition. The United States artistic swimming duo also made use of the brilliant "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec" way back in the Athens 2004 Olympics, and ended up taking home the bronze medal.




Japan's song choice makes me very happy, because I've been preaching that Nier: Automata's soundtrack is a transcendent selection of music ever since I got to play the game, but the truth is that we're long past the time when video game OSTs were just fun curiosities. There are many games nowadays whose OSTs are composed of nothing but bangers, so I must ask: which game's soundtrack would you like to see featured in the next Olympics artistic swimming competition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 wouldn't be the game it is if it wasn't introducing new weapons to acquire all the time. Snagging some new tools and getting their god rolls is the entire purpose of the late game, and is something I try to strive for constantly. One such weapon is a particularly desired bow, introduced very recently. Here's how to get the Fortunate Star bow in Destiny 2.


Where to get the Fortunate Star bow in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Fortunate Star is available as part of the Solstice event in Destiny 2. For 2024, this event runs from August 6 until August 27, letting you partake in the event and score a bunch of the new weapons. One such weapon is the Fortunate Star. If you want to farm it directly, your best bet is to run the Bonfire Bash event in the EAZ. Eventually, you should see it drop.


Alongside Bonfire Bash, the bow is also available from Solstice packages. These are earned while taking part in the event, so these should just be an extra way to get the bow to drop rather than a direct farm.


Fortunate Star god roll


If you want to farm for the best roll of the bow, you're looking to for the following perks and attachments:



Bowstring: Agile Bowstring


Arrow: Carbon Arrow Shaft


Perk 1: Archer's Tempo


Perk 2: Destabilizing Rounds



The Agile Bowstring helps out the bow's handling and stability, while Carbon Arrow Shaft adds even more to the stability. Archer's Tempo drastically reduces draw times when hitting enemies in the head, which you'll be doing a lot. Meanwhile, Destabilizing Rounds helps the Void side of the bow and makes it great for Void builds that thrive off debuffing enemies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you first begin a new save on Fields of Mistria, you have a small plot of farmable land outside your house which has a total of 68 available spaces for crop growth. You could be forgiven for thinking that’s all you can ever have, but there’s a very easy way to get more space. 


If you’re not happy with the space provided, you’ll be pleased to know that all you need in order to get some more is a shovel. Unfortunately, you’ll need to put in some work to get one. 


How to get a shovel in Fields of Mistria


Screenshot by Destructoid


Your first option is to save up 500 Tesserae in order to purchase a Worn Shovel from the General Store, which might be a tall order if you’re wanting to do this quickly. We’ve got some handy tips on making money in Fields of Mistria, but there’s also another way to get a Shovel if you’re not willing to part with the cash. 


You can, if you have the resources, make a Copper Shovel at the Forge. The Copper Shovel comes with the benefit of being able to be charged, allowing you to dig three squares at once rather than one at a time. 


You’ll need a total of 40 Copper Ore if you want to take this route, and there’s a couple of ways you can get them:



Head down into the Mines between floors 1 and 20, where Copper Ore is common


Purchase Copper Ore from the Blacksmiths for 50 Tesserae each, as long as you’ve unlocked the Mines



How to get more crop plots in Fields of Mistria


Once you’ve got your choice of shovel in hand, you can begin to expand your arable land. Getting more plots is simple, and you can even turn your entire farm into one massive crop field if you so desire. 


Just take your shovel and, as long as there isn’t anything on top of the square of land you want to dig, you can remove the grass and create a dirt square. When you’ve got your dirt area ready, you can then use your Hoe to turn this area into somewhere for your seeds to grow.

However, while this event appears regularly, knowing its exact start date can help you prepare in advance. Let's talk about when the next Peg-E Prize Drop event will happen.


Monopoly GO Peg-E Prize Drop event schedule


The next Peg-E Prize Drop event is expected to happen sometime during the second week of August. Peg-E events typically occur at the beginning and middle of each month. However, Partners and Treasures events can delay this, with the recent City Racers and upcoming Treasures dig event being some current examples. 


Although previous Prize Drop events began mid-month, such as on June 17 and July 18, other months get delayed due to Partners and digging events…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Matteo Stoppa FUTTIES card is now available in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team as the latest freebie for all.


Stoppa's FUTTIES version is part of an objective set with several tasks. While unlocking the card could take some time, the card can be obtained for free. Let's take a look at all the tasks and their conditions. 


EA FC 24 Matteo Stoppa FUTTIES objective tasks


The Matteo Stoppa FUTTIES objective has four different tasks. The tasks can be completed in any order of your liking, but some of them will end up quicker. 



Sharp Finisher: Score 5 goals using players from Italy in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Italian Shield: Concede no more than 1 goal per match in 4 separate Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi- Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 5: Play 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Victory Mindset: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).



If you want to quickly complete the tasks, the best place is Squad Battles. You end up playing against AI, and the match difficulty can also be controlled. This is the perfect solution if you've to play a sub-par squad to meet the tasks and their conditions. 


The FUTTIES Premium version of Stoppa really looks like a fun card, and it can also be played at RB/LB/CDM. The presence of Intercept+ certainly helps on the defensive end, as does Slide Tackle+ and Block+. The presence of Incisive Pass+ adds to the creative side of things. Incidentally, he has a base Defense of 99, which is  as high as it can go.

It’s an endgame activity similar to The Pit where enemies get progressively tougher, but you’ll need a certain item to even participate. The item in question is Abyssal Scrolls, so here’s what you need to do.


How to get Abyssal Scrolls in Diablo 4


To get Abyssal Scrolls in Diablo 4, you must first reach World Tier 3 in your game and have the campaign completed. Upon doing that, you will also need to complete the “Eyes of the Enemy” seasonal quest. You’ll receive an Infernal Compass which acts like a Nightmare Sigil; once you use it, you open up the activity.

Sega has released its Q1 financial report for the three months ending 30th June 2024, and while net sales are down 3.2% year-on-year, the company's entertainment division (which includes video games) is up 34% (via GamesIndustry.biz).
A large part of this increase has been attributed to the developer's acquisition of Rovio, the maker of the hugely popular Angry Birds franchise. Sega acquired the company back in August 2023, and it seems to have given it a bit of a boost this quarter, where it made 8.7 billion yen.

In a world where problems and frustrations seem to be around every corner, you might find yourself wanting to escape from it all. Maybe you dream of taking in the Japanese countryside, strolling around in a field of sunflowers, catching some bugs, fishing, all without a worry in sight. Well, if that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind muddy textures, a little funky translation, and blocky 3D models, then this is just the game for you.
Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid takes place in Japan right around the turn of the millennium. August 1999, to be exact. You play as 10-year-old Satoru, who’s traveling with his circus-owning parents, and since you’re only a kid, you aren't performing and instead have all the free time in the world for the 31 days the circus is in town. Each day follows roughly the same structure. Wake up, eat breakfast, do morning stretches, and then you’re free to do what you please until 5pm, when dinner-munching commences, and afterward, you’ll also have some nightlife hours before you enter dreamland.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent.

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.]]></summary>

If you've played an Ys game before, you know that our red-haired hero Adol Christin is pretty partial to a boat. He's also partial to a shipwreck or three. Adol's very first adventure in Ys I starts off with his boat being destroyed by a storm; Ark of Napishtim opens with Adol washed up on the beach; and in Lacrimosa of Dana, his ship is attacked by a sea serpent.
Adol is hit by sea disasters so frequently that it's joked about both in-game and by the community; there's no way we're getting on a boat with Adol, even if it's just a raft. But in Ys X: Nordics, that's exactly what you have to do — not just get on the boat with him, but enhance it, control it, and crew it. How did Nihon Falcom manage to go 35 years without giving us the helm of a ship?

Take those pesky guards, for instance. MGS2 offers up a smorgasbord of options to avoid or take out your enemies, including tranquilising them in the gonads, distracting them with noise, or straight up somersaulting into them. One player has found out, however, that if you're particularly determined to complete a non-lethal run of the game, you can recruit a few seagulls to send your foes packing (thanks, Automaton).

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

According to Digital Eclipse's Chris Kohler, although "nothing is in development" the door on a possible partnership hasn't closed, and historically speaking there are already some links.

        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/one-piece-odyssey"/>
        <updated>2024-08-06T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be dragons.
A couple of years ago, it was notable when the Switch remakes of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were developed not in-house by Game Freak, but by a smaller Japanese support studio called ILCA. That remake project was actually ILCA’s first crack at being the lead developer on a game, and it soon followed this up early last year with One Piece Odyssey, an original JRPG based on the long-running franchise about wacky pirates. Now this release has finally made its way over to the Switch, and we’re happy to report that it’s made the jump almost entirely intact. Though it’s taken a bit of a visual hit, One Piece Odyssey still proves to be an enjoyable and accessible release that's a welcome addition to the Switch’s considerable RPG library.
The narrative in One Piece Odyssey is a sort of ‘bottle episode’ that follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates crew after they shipwreck upon a mysterious island called Waford. Shortly after arriving, a mysterious figure takes away their power (cutely represented by everyone dropping from level 40 down to 1) and locks it away in various magical cubes scattered across the island. Even when they recover some of the cubes, the only way they can unlock the power contained within is through diving into illusory worlds crafted from their memories and reconquering trials they once faced, although events play out a little differently this time around because of how ‘fuzzy’ memory can be. The crew thus sets out through worlds based on the memories of some of their greatest struggles to reclaim their power and get to the bottom of what’s going on with this strange island.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!

Za HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač "zaseknout" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.

Software ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.

Jak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mayor of a small municipality in Brazil recently hosted a public screening of the blockbuster hit "Inside Out 2". The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of those perpetually disgruntled ghosts and charming goofskulls, but I might not be writing about the platform game at all if I hadn’t seen it in motion, where the vision comes together a lot more. The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.

“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time.

Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.
Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

After most of the requests were transferred to the Attorney General's office, Dotcom demanded damages for breaching his privacy. After nine years of courts handing down decisions and Dotcom filing appeal after appeal, the Court of Appeal has now denied Dotcom's request for special leave to appeal the High Court's dismissal of another appeal, against a Human Rights Tribunal's decision not to award damages.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

"If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made.
