Now that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is on its way, we'll have a few more areas to dig into, featuring the return of classic Call of Duty characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ač to podle počasí nevypadá, prázdniny skončily. Nesmutněte však, neboť již tento čtvrtek bude Virtuální Bastlírna - setkání elektroniků, bastlířů, ajťáků a všech milovníků techniky! Jaké novinky a témata tam čekají? Nový procesor na trhu zpravidla vzruší jen uživatele PC, největší novinka tohoto měsíce se týká spíše bastlířů. Raspberry vydalo nový procesor RP2350, který je výrazným vylepšením původního RP2040. Kromě Arm Cortex M33 jader skrývá také RISC-V jádra a značné množství zajímavých digitálních periferií. Ač oficiální desky ještě nejsou dostupné, samozřejmě se strahovákům procesor i tak dostal do rukou a možná i do hledáčku elektronových mikroskopů. A poví si i proč má nový Bus Pirate s tímto procesorem lehké trable a jaké zajímavosti se nachází v erratě procesoru.

Tím samozřejmě novinky nekončí - ještě se bastlíři zmíní o novém nativním konfiguračním nástroji pro síťové prvky od Mikrotiku a o podpoře jednovrstvých plošných spojů v Altiu. Protože jsou ale bastlíři, nezapomenou i na čistě hardwarová témata.

Ze světa hardwaru ukáží nejen novinky nebo praktické poznatky ohledně minimalistických sad nářadí, které se dají vždy nosit s sebou, ale i pár lehce "retro" projektů. Vznikla například replika klávesnice k počítači Ondra a ke starým osciloskopům se dá v současnosti koupit emulátor disketové mechaniky, který používá standardní USB flash disky.

A jak je zvykem, mají strahováci nachystaná i obskurní až bizarní témata, kupříkladu simulátor 555 na Attiny, čínské klony karet MIFARE Classic s nedokumentovaným backdoorem nebo velice osobité útržky z legendární knihy Rozeberte si PC.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

But did you know it's possible to get the material minutes after creating your world? Here's how to get cord in LEGO Fortnite, as well as the best way to farm it.


How to get and farm cord in LEGO Fortnite


You can get cord in LEGO Fortnite by defeating NPCs carrying the material, taking it from treasure chests, or crafting it with the Spinning Wheel. Of the three, the latter is by far the best method for those looking to farm, as you will only need five Vines to craft each cord. You can get vines in LEGO Fortnite by harvesting bushes and crops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Future Cat Games is currently working on gardening-themed mystery Margin of the Strange, but there's now another way to experience their previous title. The expanded OneShot: World Machine Edition has lined up a September 30, 2024 debut on Steam. 


Following a few years after the original OneShot's PC launch back in 2016, World Machine Edition made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in September 2022. It's not just a simple re-release with enhancements. World Machine Edition was rebuilt for consoles and portables from the ground up, complete with a new engine and new user interface.




There are also new hidden collectibles scattered throughout the world, which challenges players with puzzles that require working between two realities. Other updated features include a "Friends" character profile gallery — as well as one full of cutscene art — guest artist wallpapers, a music box, and full controller support. 


The setup of OneShot is simple enough. You're a child exploring a strange new world in an attempt to restore a sun that's been dead for a long time. It is, in fact, a big ol' light bulb. Doing so involves a lot of fourth-wall-breaking actions, like messing around with the computer's operating system outside of the game. Throughout the journey, you as the player end up developing an interesting relationship of your own with protagonist Niko. 


If you plan on going portable with this one, OneShot now fully supports Steam Deck. The original OneShot was a really cool mix of puzzling and adventuring with a memorable aesthetic and some solid jams. That the updated version essentially introduced more stuff to an already fun game is reason enough to give this one a spin when it hits Steam later this month.

We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 


With all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week.

Each type of animal has its own set of Cosmetics, and while some can be purchased at Hayden’s Shop on Sweetwater Farm, others are earned through breeding certain types of the animal or other gameplay. Seasonal variants each come with unique Cosmetic items, which can then be used for all other animals of the same type regardless of which tier that animal is.

If you’re looking to catch a Sea Cucumber, there are two different times during which it can be caught. Firstly, it can be found between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. during Fall and Winter, on the Beach or on your Farm, if you opted to play on a Beach Farm. 


The second opportunity to catch a Sea Cucumber comes during the Night Market, which occurs between Winter 15 and 17. Each night during the event, fishing in the deep-sea submarine offers a 5% chance to reel in a Sea Cucumber.

The trailer is a bit sparse. It opens with some animated art displaying the protagonist losing an arm, then receiving a new one. There are cyborg-ish zombies and dudes in military gear. The protagonist chooses to attack the zombies. There’s a bit of gameplay showing the rusty sci-fi interiors, smoke-machine fog, and lock-on combat. There’s not a whole lot, but what’s there looks like a game.




Graft was first teased some months ago when Harebrained spoke about their challenges getting a publisher. They say that, when showing off the preliminary idea, they were essentially told, “come see us after you’ve found the fun and then we’ll take a look.” Now, it looks like they’re going to be self-publishing it with the help of the Epic MegaGrant, if the trailer is any indication.


Personally, I still want more Shadowrun, which has been untouched since 2015’s Shadowrun: Hong Kong. However, Shadowrun creator Jordan Weisman left the company around 2018 when it was sold to Paradox, so I imagine the staff is excited to branch out. Unfortunately, that leaves me Shadowrun-less, but I’ll somehow press forward.


Graft is coming to PC. No release window has been announced.

That's why it's crucial to keep track of the game's event schedules, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member.

When is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?


According to the official Pokémon Go page, the next Community Day will be Sept. 14, 2024, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. The spotlight will be on Ponyta and Galarian Ponyta, where you'll encounter these creatures more frequently in the wilds. If you catch enough of them, it may result in a Shiny variant.

The secret area of Chapter 5 can be accessed if you follow the Pale-Axe Stalwart’s quest from the beginning. After you defeat him in that initial invasion, you can talk to him. As always, exhaust his dialogue just to be safe.


Progress through the chapter until you encounter the first two Elemental Carts. Upon defeating the Gray Bronze cart in the narrow canyon area, return to the Camp of Seasons Shrine. Talk to him again and exhaust his dialogue.

This is incidentally the first time that Romeu has received a special card in Ultimate Team this year. Since the card is part of an SBC, all players have equal chance at obtaining it. Let's see how you can unlock the card, and if you should complete the challenge at all. 


EA FC 24 Oriol Romeu FUTTIES SBC tasks


With just one task, it won't be difficult to meet the requirements of the Oriol Romeu FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task 1 - Oriol Romeu



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. Team Rating: 87



EA FC 24 Oriol Romeu FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solutions of completing the Oriol Romeu FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. If you don't have the exact cards, just use ones with the same overall ratings. 


Task 1 - Oriol Romeu



Fabinho 84


Wendie Renard 88


Bernardo Silva 88


Koen Casteels 84


Bruno Fernandes 88


Christina Endler 88


Alexandra Popp 88


Stanislav Lobotka 84


Lena Oberdorf 87


Luka Modric 87


Laura Freigang 83



As someone who spent over 1200 hours in EA FC 24, I have no idea what's the point of completing this SBC. At this stage, everyone has better cards to play in the midfield. The only use for this SBC is to get a 97-rated card for cheap, which you can then use to complete another special challenge. EA Sports has released some amazing SBCs in recent nights, but this isn't one of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadlock is a MOBA, which means that skill, decision-making, and game sense all play in to how well you'll perform. This goes for any online PvP game, but more so here than a lot of others thanks to just how much you need to learn and keep track of. 


A ranking system can help to make sure you aren't put against people with a much greater understanding than you. Here's whether Deadlock has MMR that it factors into matchmaking.


Does Deadlock match you based on skill level?


Image via Destructoid.


While not outwardly apparently, especially with no ranked mode present, Deadlock does use MMR in its matchmaking. Every time you queue up for a match, it uses a variety of hidden factors including your average soul count, kills and deaths, and win/loss ratio to put you up against people who perform similarly. This can sometimes increase queue times as it finds these people, but the trade-off is that the quality of the matches increases.
However, you may notice at times that matches aren't always fair with someone much better than you. There can be a few reasons for this. Most notable in the short term is that the game is in early development. Many aspects of the game are still in their early iterations, including the MMR, so there's a good chance it may slip up and put you against someone much better than you, or vice versa. This has the added consequence of influencing matchmaking, as games where you either stomp or get destroyed can wildly sway what Deadlock thinks your skill level is.


During this period, you shouldn't think about MMR too much. Given that Deadlock doesn't even have a competitive mode yet, let alone anything permanent or long-term for playing, you gain and lose nothing for wins and losses. Instead, you should focus on having fun and finding ways to improve your gameplay. Practice makes perfect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has announced that System Era Softworks’ 2019 survival crafting game is getting its first paid DLC. Glitchwalkers will add new biomes, technology, gameplay features, and “that game’s first true villain.” I guess they don’t count that one player in a group that tries to sabotage everyone else. That’s usually me.


I’m going to paste part of the press release here because I don’t know how else to describe the DLC:


“Players seeking new challenges are in for a treat with the introduction of Lyn, a disgruntled member of the ESS Elysium crew who has taken to tinkering with the Astroneer Training Program’s (ATP) code. Players must work with the Elysium’s Head of Maintenance, Frank, to stop Lyn and her nefarious plans before she dismantles the ATP from the inside.”




“Glitchwalkers will transport players to Aeoluz, an enormous new planet born in a glitched solar system where they’ll be tasked with counter hacking Lyn and breaking firewalls to return the ATP to normal.”


I’m not totally sure what to make of that. The trailer doesn’t really say much, either, at least not to someone who’s only familiar with the early game, such as myself. I really enjoyed Astroneer back when I played it in Early Access, but the person I was playing it with didn’t dig it, so we stopped just as I was getting into it. The important thing with this announcement is that there will be more biomes and a new tech tree.


This news follows Devolver’s purchase of System Era Softworks late last year. It’s interesting to see a game that reached 1.0 years ago get paid DLC, but that’s one of the benefits of the digital marketplace. I guess.


Astroneer’s Glitchwalkers DLC does not yet have an announced release window.

Right now, you can play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta in early access, and if you have missed out on this window, the open beta arrives shortly for everyone to jump in, from September 6 to 9.


How to inspect weapons in Black Ops 6 beta

To inspect your weapons in Black Ops 6, simply:



Press the "I" button on your keyboard. For console or controller players, press the D-pad Left button.


Then, choose the Weapon Inspect option (the third one on the list).



That's it. The inspection will start right away and the UI will be hidden briefly. Remember, you won't be able to shoot immediately, so make sure to be in a safe place first before inspecting your weapon. Every weapon in Black Ops 6 has the same inspection animation. However, if you purchase special blueprints from the store, they'll come with some unique animations that you won't find elsewhere.


To cancel the inspect animation, all you need to do is press any button — your shooting, aiming, crouch, or sprint buttons will work. However, this feature won't work if Tactical Sprinting is active or any other object such as a Semtex or Frag Grenade is in your hand.


While running across all the maps available and shooting down enemies, you might want to inspect the weapon you're using and admire it, or even get a screenshot for your YouTube video thumbnail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the best weapon loadouts are essential to reign supreme in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta multiplayer, having the right audio settings is equally important.


In ideal situations, the best audio settings will make you aware of incoming footsteps or a possible flank from enemies. This small piece of info within that fraction of a time will mentally prepare you to take an unhinged gunfight.

When it comes to the microphone level, everyone will have a different device so it's best to set it according to your liking. I would suggest using the Test Microphone feature to find a sweet spot with enough audibility and less noise.


In my case, setting the Microphone Level at 5 was enough and I'm also using the Noise Removal effect in NVIDIA Broadcast software. The default input in my Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta copy is Microphone (NVIDIA Broadcast). If you have an RTX GPU, it's better to use this feature as it helps to reduce noise significantly.


However, if you're still stuck with a GTX graphics card, try using the NVIDIA RTX Voice app for the same effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Arhat Gold Piece is an important key item you’ll get in Black Myth: Wukong that’s needed to unlock the secret area of Chapter 2. It’s also missable if you aren’t careful of your surroundings, so this is what you need to do.


How to get the Arhat Gold Piece in Black Myth: Wukong


The Arhat Gold Piece can be obtained after defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands boss by the Valley of Despair Shrine. During the fight, you do have to bait him to destroy the wall with all the praying monks.


It’s rather easy to have the First Prince attack this area of the arena since he’s very aggressive and tackles you everywhere you go. Just make sure that during the fight, he doesn’t pin you against the wall and kill you. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


If at any point in the fight, you never get him to destroy that wall for you, all is not lost. You can use the Wandering Wight spirit after the fight to destroy this. The area is still accessible, so you’re free to come back to it to do so.


Once the wall is broken, you will enter a new area where its only purpose is to gather this item from a chest.


Screenshot by Destructoid


What is the Arhat Gold Piece for in Black Myth: Wukong?


As you progress through the Drunken Pig’s quest in the game, you will need this item along with the two Sobering Stones and Jade Lotus items. Once you encounter his brother, the Yellow-Robed Squire, back where this quest started, you need this item in the secret area of Chapter 2.


It’ll help you progress through this part of the quest to get the item that can help you turn the tide of battle when fighting against the Yellow Wind Sage. The Wind Tamer isn’t necessary but will negate most of this boss’ wind and sand attacks that can easily kill you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're truly living in uncertain times when it comes to industry jobs and sadly, Rocksteady appears to have been the latest victim in a round of layoffs. The studio itself recently brought us Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, which may be partly responsible for the layoffs.


The report comes from Eurogamer, with some unnamed staff members from the studio's QA team in particular noting a series of redundancies. The department is said to have been "cut in half over the past month," though losses within the company may have affected other teams as well.




One member of staff has apparently spoken out on social media about how they were laid off from Rocksteady while on paternity leave. At the time of writing, publisher Warner Bros. has yet to comment on these reports.


Kill the studios, it seems


 In a classic case of cause-and-effect, it appears as though the poor sales of Suicide Squad has been cited as one of the reasons for the studio "restructuring." Rocksteady senior management has acknowledged that product quality will now suffer as a result, per Eurogamer's report.


Perhaps many won't be surprised by this revelation. Kill the Justice League was not exactly welcomed with open arms by the community. Currently, the game is showing as "Mixed" for all reviews and "Mostly Negative" for recent ones over on Steam.


However, if all this is true, it's still a sad time to be working in the games industry at the moment. We've seen thousands of developers lose their jobs over the past year or so, as well as entire studios being shuttered. There doesn't appear to be light at the end of the tunnel for job security in gaming, at the moment.

Alongside a global release time map (or two maps, technically, since they’re pulling that pay-more-to-play-early nonsense), there’s a big Q&A covering all your burning questions about burning 'nids. Among these is a confirmation that, no, the action game won’t be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo.

Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports.

Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s one we missed from this week’s release round-up, possibly because Konami appear to have given it precisely zero promotion: the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a four-game bundle spanning PC ports of three well-regarded DS Castlevanias, plus a redesigned version of Castlevania Haunted Castle, the first Castlevania game to grace an arcade machine. It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

The first of this fearful trio, Hunger Of The Beast Clan, is down to launch in Q4 2024, which translates to sometime during the period 1st October to 31st December.
It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

The complaint, write Game Developer, is over “bad faith bargaining” and “concerted activities” - which covers "retaliation, discharge, [and] discipline."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in March, Bungie announced a leadership reshuffle on their Marathon reboot project, with former Valorant dev Joe Ziegler replacing veteran Bungie designer Christopher Barrett as director. It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fmovies was once the world's most popular pirate streaming site. Then mid-June, after years of smooth sailing, it vanished into thin air. Sites with over a billion annual visits tend not to throw everything away so easily. Yet last night, a site with close to two billion visits disappeared in similar circumstances, rapidly followed by another, and then many others after that. In the absence of an official announcement, earlier today we took an early sift through the wreckage.

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.

At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.
Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

With just four months left of 2024, a software supplier hasn't even been chosen yet. With the current system falling over, previously blocked domains and IP addresses are being unblocked to make room for new ones, something that the law has no provision for. Meanwhile, smart TV manufacturers will soon be asked to ban a VPN app from their sets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

As is customary, I must jam my new cat into every article. I’ve tried to offer her several books, but she’s failed to turn even a single page so far. What a big dumbo. The best dumbo. The sweetest, smartest dumbo in the world, yes she is. Ahem. This week, it’s Supermassive, Niantic, and Sensible Object narrative designer and Limit Break mentor, Anastasia Dukakis! Cheers Ana!

The second season ended earlier this month after the eighth episode, though many fans had hoped for more. Pirates who downloaded the unexpected 'House of the Dragon S02E09' release got a surprise bonus, but not the one they were hoping for.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

It's still that, but now it's getting a 1.0 release on October 4th.

The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have experience of the London rental market, there's only one way you can react to a game – a French game, no less, the product of a country where two-bed apartments apparently grow on trees – that promises to maroon you in a sprawling labyrinth of flats. “Haha, alright for some!” you chortle despairingly, after freeing yourself from the laundry basket and retrieving your trousers from the fridge. “I bet labyrinths have more than one window,” you sob, as you yet again tackle the problem of opening the front door without becoming part of the wall. 
If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt. On which note, Looking For Fael seems fun.

Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailers of Gamescom 2024 want to be here with you, explained Keighley in his opening monologue. They are not directed at you. They are with you. That's lovely. Thanks videogames.  And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then FPS sequel Borderlands 4 surely loves us the most.
Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at this year's Geoffcom, RoadCraft is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As much as I’m a sucker for the grimmest and darkest of grimdark fantasy settings, the try-hardness of it all can get a bit grating at times. You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".
