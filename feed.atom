        <updated>2024-05-30T23:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is "styling," which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the "save the world" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PC and PlayStation 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next phase of the Monster Hunter series is beginning to kick off with the PlayStation State of Play's Monster Hunter Wilds trailer. In it, we get a few breathtaking cinematics and a first look into gameplay.




Prepare for an adrenaline-pumping adventure as the trailer introduces a host of formidable monsters. The first battle showcases a massive bear-like creature, promising a challenging boss fight. The reptilian adversaries are equally menacing, adding even more formidable showdowns.


Monster Hunter's classic combat still holds true in this next iteration, where we see the brutality of a gun first-hand. And, of course, there needed to be at least one gigantic sword, as one of the characters deals a deadly blow to the creature.


Unfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, as the trailer only depicted cinematics and gameplay. However, we do know that it is slated for 2025 at least, and wishlists are currently available.


Similar to past iterations, Monster Hunter Wilds has you hunting down for, you guessed it, monsters. Given that it's in the wilds, the environment will change constantly. That means extra challenges are ahead, bringing out unique wildlife across the Forbidden Lands.


For those who have journeyed with the series in the past, Wilds brings a wealth of new moves, weapons, and equipment to master. Get ready to explore fresh strategies and unleash devastating attacks with these exciting additions.


While we eagerly await an official release date, one thing is certain: Monster Hunter Wilds will be a multi-platform adventure. You can look forward to embarking on this thrilling hunt on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Survios debuted the first gameplay trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion during today's PlayStation State of Play. The VR single-player action-horror game focuses on an all-new storyline in the Alien universe as they try to survive an encounter with the "Perfect Organism" in VR.




Built in Unreal Engine 5, Alien: Rogue Incursion utilizes the power of VR to drop players into an intense action-horror environment as they try to survive and outsmart the Alien with shooter-style gameplya and mechanics as they explore an Alien-infested facility on the harsh planet of Purdan.


Alien: Isolation is still one of my favorite horror titles of all time, so if Rogue Incursion can manage to channel even a fraction of that I'll be happy. Besides, Isolationfelt like a perect transition into VR so this could very well be a perfect match.


Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to release this Holiday 2024 on PlayStation VR2, PCVR via Steam, and Meta Quest 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The father-son duo Kratos and Atreus are back and better than ever in the upcoming God of War Ragnarok PC release, which will launch on Sept. 19, 2024.


At the PlayStation State of Play 2024 showcase, it was revealed that the game's PC spec will harness the power of NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XESS 1.3. This cutting-edge technology, combined with "unlocked frame rates" and "super ultrawide support," ensures an extraordinary gaming experience.




You can also play the Valhalla DLC, which will be a part of the PC release, to get more bang for your buck. In this story, you'll experience the journey of Kratos and Atreus as they explore the Nine Realms. The action-adventure game unravels the secrets within Ragnarok's profound lore, which is heavily tied to Greek mythology.


I've pleasantly enjoyed seeing the God of War franchise take off over the years. I remember the old PS2 days when Kratos was just a brute with a large weapon. Now, he's become a loving father to show off his more sentimental side. It's not something I quite expected, but it's welcomed, nonetheless. 


Now that the God of War Ragnarok PC release is on its way, I'm curious to see when the next entry will debut. But for now, make sure to mark your calendars for its Sept. 19, 2024 debut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.
The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan." 
"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage." 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.]]></summary>

The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-30T22:52:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation's unofficial mascot, at least in my eyes, is back for his own big adventure. Astro Bot is a fully fledged new game starring the rambunctious little bot, and it arrives on PlayStation 5 on September 6, 2024.


Previously starring in games like Astro Bot Rescue Mission for Sony's VR headset and in the fantastic launch title Astro's Playroom for the PS5, Astro Bot gives Team Asobi's little fella a game all his own. Granted, it looks like he'll still be platforming around, meeting famous Sony characters, and utilizing PlayStation tech from throughout the console lineup's history.




We can expect more than 50 worlds to explore, which is a substantial amount of Astro Bot to dig into. But if it remains as charming and fun as the previous games, this might be a big-hitter for Sony. At least in today's trailer, shown off during the Sony State of Play, we can see plenty of fun levels and interesting gameplay moments, including flying a giant PlayStation 5 into space.


It will have to carry the weight either way, as today's State of Play was a little short on other major Sony reveals. Concord feels like it's already off to a rough start after its official unveiling, and other games felt like they only got small updates, with several major games like Monster Hunter Wilds still aiming for 2025 rather than 2024.


I believe in Astro Bot, though. He's quickly become a favorite face of mine in the Sony roster, and this new entry looks delightful. If nothing else, I have a hopefully solid platformer to look forward to on September 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the PlayStation State of Play stream, Konami and Bloober Team have given us a deeper look at the remake of Silent Hill 2. It focuses mostly on Angela Orosco, as well as some pretty familiar-looking scenes from the game. More importantly, we have a release date of October 8, 2024.


I think it looks decent. What do you think? Here’s the trailer:




There’s a lot that’s really familiar being shown off. It looks to me like Bloober Team are trying very hard to keep it as close to the original as they can while making modern changes. However, it doesn’t really matter how careful they are; they’re working on an extremely beloved game, and not everyone is going to love it.


Frankly, I think Silent Hill 2 is a great game, but I’m not huge on it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fantastic, I’m just not totally enthusiastic. I don’t think a remake is really going to change that, but I’m open to the possibility.


Silent Hill 2 (the remake) is out on October 8, 2024 for PS5 and PC.

Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. 
For more, watch the Monster Hunter Wilds reveal trailer from last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Sony's May 30 2024 State of Play, developer Firewalk Studios detailed its upcoming 5v5 PvP-focused FPS called Concord. Originally revealed in 2023, this is the first concrete details we've seen about Concord since. After starting with a nearly 5-minute long cinematic trailer that gave massive Guardians of the Galaxy vibes, we got a roughly 2-minute long gameplay trailer that looked a lot like Overwatch.




Players take on the role of a Freegunner and join their teammates to take on rival Freegunner crews in space heists across six different 5v5 PvP modes that take places on a variety of planets and exotic maps on those planets. There seems to be some pretty interesting variety between the characters, but the genre feels so overdone at this point I can't help but wonder if Concord is a bit late to the party.


Concord is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive but will also launch on PC, though despite the recent Helldivers 2 fiasco, Concord will in fact require a PlayStation Network account to be played on PC. Those interested in taking on the role of a Freegunner and jumping into the 5v5 PvP gameplay will have the opportunity to do so when the Early Access beta drops on June 6, 2024, with the full release scheduled for August 23, 2024.

Shown off during the PlayStation State of Play today, Infinity Nikki is a dress-up adventure game where you'll need the abilities of different outfits to go on your journey. Also, there's an adorable cat companion.




Reader, I'll be the first to tell you, I don't really know what's up with this series, other than the way I've heard those knowledgeable in it talk about the games with reverence. I do trust those people, and so I will say, this looks good! The lighting and designs are gorgeous, and it feels like there are probably some mysteries lurking under the surface.


Any more than that, and you'll probably be better served by signing up for the Q3 test. If you want to master the power of style, best to keep an eye on the Infinity Nikki socials for information about the upcoming hands-on opportunity.

I don’t know what else to say about it. There’s a bajillion dudes on screen, a “nameless hero” cuts through them with a variety of weapons. Here’s the trailer:




The last Dynasty Warriors game came out back in 2018, so we’ve been due. In between those years, we got a bunch of (sometimes awesome) spin-offs. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Houses was 2022, and I thought it was pretty good. Will be nice to play one on shinier hardware, though.


Dynasty Warrior Origins is coming in 2025. The only confirmed platform so far is PS5.

This follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while "tentpole" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as a single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: "You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way."
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries.

        <updated>2024-05-30T22:03:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

        <updated>2024-05-30T21:37:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks the official release of Redfall’s last update, which brings the game to a sad and premature end. 


Redfall didn’t really impress when it dropped earlier this year, but for those few gamers who are still hanging on, this new update actually does provide some exciting features. Arkane has added a “Community Standing” system that lets you progress through six different ranks of various buffs by completing missions, unlocking Safehouses, and saving citizens. There are also a substantial number of smaller changes, like the new Elder Nests that serve as boss battles, new enemies and weapons, and improvements to the game’s lackluster AI. Plus there’s an added “Story Mode” difficulty setting to help players relax while vanquishing vampires. 


Of course, this update also adds an offline mode to the game, so whenever the Redfall servers go offline, people can still keep playing. Microsoft recently announced the closure of Arkane Austin, along with three other studios, in a brutal move that’s still a bit hard to understand. It’s not the first time Microsoft has made aggressive cuts this year – in January alone the company announced it would be laying off 1,900 employees. 


Arkane included a brief message in the patch notes, writing, “We’re thankful for the millions of players who have joined us. From everyone at Arkane Austin, thank you for playing our games and loving our worlds, it’s been an honor to deliver these experiences to you.” 


Redfall won’t be getting its planned DLC, and presumably, we won’t be seeing anything else from Arkane Austin. Redfall wasn’t the studio's greatest success and really had some genuine problems, but it’s still hard to see a studio go down like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a soft spot for perspective-switching games, and AVA and the Half-World already looks like one to keep an eye on. While there's no release date in place, developer Bread Panda revealed the roguelite action game for PC in a trailer that shows off its shooting in side- and forward-scrolling flavors.


The trailer also gives us a peek at the beautiful art that fuels it all, both in its characters and creatures and the colorful world they inhabit.  




In what sounds like a futile affair, AVA's destiny involves fading away with the rest of the world. With the end all but inevitable, AVA soars through the islands of the Sidereal Riptide, blasting away at enemies, collecting artifacts, and hopefully solving the mysteries that await. 


As the trailer shows, one of the key hooks of that journey is the way AVA can transition from firing away on a 2D plane to blasting forth through visuals akin to classic rail shooters like Space Harrier. From what I can gather, at least, it looks like more of a visual trick that retains the side-scrolling combat on a different plane. However it may work, it's still a very cool idea that looks great in motion.

Bread Panda took inspiration from roguelites and adventure games, with the former lending itself to repeat expeditions that play out in unique ways. There's also the mechanic of collecting artifacts and choosing which to keep and which to return to the Riptide, giving you the opportunity to customize AVA's fighting style with various weapons and relics. AVA and the Half-World will eventually be entering an increasingly busy space, but I'm keen on seeing how its key gimmick and idiosyncratic design sense play out in practice.

With the completion of the first phase of Operation "Enduring Peace," Helldivers now must pump the volatile goo into Meridia's surface. Once the divers reach "critical mass," the planet will implode into a black hole, taking the super-horny Terminids in its wake. I guess nuking things from orbit just isn't cool enough for today's modern kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After allowing players to level up their weapons faster in XDefiant last weekend, Ubisoft decided to come back and gift everyone another double weapon XP period. 


Ubisoft confirmed that double weapon XP will be available starting Friday at 10 a.m. ET and ending Monday at 1 p.m. ET. This comes after players complained that XDefiant's weapon progression is 'criminally slow.' 


One XDefiant player claimed it takes over 100 hours to level up one weapon. XDefiant developer Patrick 'ACHES' Price clapped back and attempted to reassure fans by claiming that its 3500 XP per weapon level and one kill equals 100 XP. So, operating under that math, it is a maximum of 35 kills per level. 




For secondary weapons, that requirement is even less, with 1500 XP per weapon level. Each weapon has 50 levels, meaning it could take players a few hours to reach the max level on every weapon, but it all depends on their skill level. 


Skilled players should be able to get around 20-30 kills per round, but that's also no easy feat. It's unclear how much of a difference it makes with double XP active, but users should take advantage of it while they can. To get XP faster, Domination or Occupy. Both game modes are fast-paced and take place on the title's smaller-scaled maps.

The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Hidden faces' are a type of collectible in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. Well, they actually bar the way from the true collectible, a small tree that offers a bit of lore. The hidden faces are tough to spot in Hellblade 2, but we have all the locations below.



Hellblade 2: All hidden faces and their locations


There are 17 hidden faces locations throughout Hellblade 2. Believe it or not, they appear as stone faces carved into walls. Crazy, right? Focusing on them causes them to 'disappear', opening a path to a small tree — akin to Yggdrasil, the Nordic world tree — beyond, along with a bit of narration. It's kind of a cool effect with the faces melting into the environment, but I digress. Let's look for some trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Shape is nearly upon Destiny 2 players, but that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to shoehorn in collaborations with other properties. Wizards of the Coast and Sony/Bungie have now teamed up to bring Dungeons and Dragons to Destiny 2. Kindly put aside the finale you've been waiting a decade for, it's time to pony up some cash for medieval fantasy gear in a science fiction shooter.


Somehow, the Mindflayer Warlock makes too much sense




The announcement came via the official Destiny 2 account on X. Fans of both franchises will be able to indulge on June 4, 2024, when the collaboration goes live with the release of The Final Shape. From armor sets to an emblem and even a physical Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, there's plenty here.



Apex Draconic Set (Titan)


Flayer's Dominion Set (Warlock)


Spectral Displacer Set (Hunter)


Queen of Dragons Ship


Owlbear Chariot Sparrow


Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell


Bigby's Fist Finisher


Natural 20 Emote

This isn't the first time that Bungie has partnered with another property in a bizarre crossover. Earlier this year, we had the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire crossover, and prior to that, Bungie teamed up with CD Projekt Red for a Witcher crossover (though Cyberpunk would have made more sense).


In a world where corporations are teaming up to milk their audiences for all they're worth, it's not shocking to see collaborations. However, all I ask is that they try to fit the theme of one another. Destiny is a series set in the far-flung future, so when medieval properties get thrown in, it feels very out of place. But, enough of my grousing, let's focus on the real issue: the lack of an Astarion Hunter set.

Fans of the Dune series will inevitably get through the six mainline books and couple of adaptations in a decent amount of time. If that happens to be you, here are 10 science fiction books like the Dune series.


These particular sci-fi books carry elements or ideas similar to the classic millennia-spanning series from Herbert. Some of them carry the heavy political themes, while others focus on the “chosen one” ideas. Still more carry some of the weirder features of the Dune series, such as strange powers and characters. Any Dune fan should check out the 10 science fiction books and series below.

After spending some time with this patch, I think it's by far the worst that Epic has ever dropped, losing sight of what even made Fortnite enjoyable in the first place. 


Think back to your favorite Fortnite memories. How many involve getting run over by a guy in a vehicle? I know that that number is zero for me, and I'd guess for many of you, it's the same. Yet for some reason, Epic has decided that Season 3: Wrecked should be all about the cars.

The Evercade is a retro-focused family of consoles and handhelds. What distinguishes it from mini consoles, is the fact that its games are stored on cartridge. The collections Blaze releases have included games from consoles, classic microcomputers, and modern digital games, but one of the most important facets of its preservation efforts is with arcade games from developers like Toaplan and Data East.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Were you holding off on grabbing Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth until you could get its two discs marked down? Amazon has one lined up for you. How does 20-ish% off sound?


Right now, you can nab Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth from the US Amazon site for $54.99. I’ve checked my home and native land Canada’s site, and it’s marked down to $69.99 Canadian Loonies. It’s also discounted on Amazon in Germany and the UK.


It’s a decent price for a grand and varied adventure. It’s a lot of adventure. Maybe too much. But it’s a very different sort of adventure compared to Final Fantasy VII: Remake. Sure, it still features the same mechanics, characters, and feel. Sure, it’s a continuation of the previous story (and the middle part of a trilogy), but both tonally and in terms of setting, it’s an entirely new ballgame. Also, there’s lots of time to appreciate Barrett. Barrett’s so great.


Don’t take my word for it, you can also check out Destructoid’s own Chris Carter’s 9.5/10 review.


There’s no doubt this won’t be the last time you’ll be able to grab it at a discount, but if you’ve been itching to get it without completely depleting your funds, it’s a good opportunity. It probably won’t be permanently reduced for quite a while, especially with ports to other platforms that might be coming next year.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is currently available for PS5. Amazon doesn’t say how long the sale will go on, so you may want to jump on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always looked past Call of Duty Blackcell bundles, mostly because I don't feel like breaking the bank with its paywall. But, with the release of MW3 and Warzone Season 4, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.


What makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player's skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as The Boys' Homelander, you can put 'em in their place by taking and using their skin. Call of Duty reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate Warzone player.




While the result of copying the Operator skins is the primary show-stopper, it doesn't hurt that the ability just looks cool. It's as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.


The only downside is that the Blackcell Operator's stealing technique is temporary. That means you'll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.


The Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear.

Despite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in MW3 and Warzone could be worth it. You could think of it as an investment, since it gives you other exclusive skins for free, at least in a temporary sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In collaboration with Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games made substantial changes in the past two Modern Warfare 3 updates, which have major implications for the Call of Duty League. 


As part of the Season 4 update, Modern Warfare 3 decreased footstep sounds for enemies, reworked the Hardpoint hills on 6 Star to exclude the pool point, removed exploding propane barrels on Highrise, buffed the MCW headshot multiplier, buffed Rival-9 damage ranges, and buffed the Cruise Missile damage range. Going back even further, the Trophy System was reworked in the Season 3 Reloaded update to be destroyed in two shots instead of three and the entire Boots Perk category saw a massive overhaul.

The long-rumoured LEGO Zelda set has finally, officially been unveiled and, despite the cost of the adult-focused set causing many a Zelda fan to spit-take their Lon Lon Milk across the room, the 2-in-1 Great Deku Tree looks like a beauty. Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that's gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.
Eschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it's clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets. Those are great, but for adults it's perhaps more exciting to see larger builds and pieces meant equally for display in addition to play.

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot' Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…]]></summary>

I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

        <updated>2024-05-30T13:42:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game & Network Services Segment" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. 
For more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games.

This isn't the first time the over-the-top explode 'em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it's been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Daybreaker.
We're always a little bit wary whenever someone says that the latest game in Falcom's Trails series is "a great place to start". We know we've said in the past — as we did with Trails from Zero — but it's a statement we always put a lot of consideration into.
This statement holds a lot of weight in this franchise, both among fans, who want everyone to get the same magical experience by playing the series in the 'right order', and newcomers, who have the daunting task of playing 10 games — all between 40 and 140 hours of playtime each — across multiple different platforms. But for the newest entry coming out in the West later this year, The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, it feels a bit different.

WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.


This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.]]></summary>

Developer Badass Mongoose has today revealed a first look at Helix: Descent N Ascent — a gorgeous-looking puzzle adventure that will make its way to Switch in 2025.
This is a non-linear adventure that will see you exploring a long-forgotten world, unlocking skills and abilities along the way — including the power to remove and control your own head, it seems. Sounds a little Hollow Knight-y, no? Well, don't expect that kind of intensity. It seems that Helix is all about the vibes, with "non-violent gameplay" putting the focus on puzzle-solving and storytelling as you try to work out what happened to the abandoned world.

I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.

He began speaking at middle schools, high schools, and universities regarding the importance of drug abuse prevention and how making positive choices can lead to a more fulfilled life. So wholesome, right?
Unfortunately, it seems like Curcio is up to his old tricks. According to a report from Fox 13 Seattle (thanks, Nintendo Wire), he and an accomplice, Iosif Bondarchuk, were recently arrested over their potential involvement in scamming up to $2 million from buyers of rare Pokémon and sports cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

Last month, Bandai Namco unveiled a first look at That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles, an upcoming RPG based on the popular anime series. The game isn't set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.
If you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we'd wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

        <updated>2024-05-29T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called "bullet heaven," puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.]]></summary>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima).

Hello Games is preparing to launch the third large No Man's Sky update of the year, 'Adrift'. While previous patches have all been about adding more, this one strips things back.
In 'Adrift,' the universe has been abandoned. There are no other lifeforms — say goodbye to shopping, trading and shortcuts — and only echoes of a long-gone civilisation remain. Oh, and we should also mention that Sandworm numbers have increased, so be careful when taking a stroll across desert planets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A nest of Namco nonograms.
It’s been rough out there for poor Picross fans during this generation, as they’ve been cruelly starved for content with only 23 game releases on Switch (if you count the 'e' series) that offer up a paltry sum of over 5,000 puzzles to solve. Those puzzles aren’t even all original either—if you really want to be pedantic, the Mega Picross puzzles are usually repeats.
But it’s all going to be okay now. After the success of a Sega-themed Picross S Genesis & Master System Edition release a few years ago, Jupiter has now committed to another crossover, this time borrowing from Namco’s extensive arcade history with Picross S Namco Legendary Edition. What does this mean for you? Well, it’s another few hundred puzzles to complete, but this time some of them might have Pac-Man characters.

We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

Celeste composer and game developer Lena Raine has revealed her latest project ANOTHEREAL, a shmup RPG that combines exploration, puzzle-solving, and tense combat encounters.
Though a Switch release has not been confirmed at the time of writing, we remain hopeful that the eventual Steam release will pave the way for more platform launches (and maybe our enthusiasm will give publisher Radical Dreamland a bit of a nudge!). Similarly, a release date has not yet been set, so we could be in for a bit of a wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quest Master answers the prayers of a certain segment of the Zelda fanbase by letting them create their own dungeons. With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, "The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games' versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery "video game", which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game's crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evils Code Veronica and 0 will be the next entries in the survival horror series to get the remake treatment, according to rumours. “A remake of Resident Evil Zero & Code Veronica in development right now,” claimed user Dusk Golem on Le Epic Musk Zone. The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

Sometimes, it's because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week's new PC games of note.

It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing "services to pirates" that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse.

It would be another nine years before Expend4bles shook things up with a new title format but little else had changed. Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada's Federal Court.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn't work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO and PlayStation have found their Isaac for The Last of Us Season 2, and it's Jeffrey Wright, the actor behind the voice of Isaac in The Last of Us Part II. Perhaps best known for roles like The Watcher in Marvel's What If...?, Commissioner Gordon in The Batman, and Bernard in HBO's Westworld series, as well as his role as Thelonious "Monk" Ellison in 2023's American Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Wright will return to Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic world to give Isaac another go. 
HBO announced this today with a quick post on X (formerly Twitter) that you can see below:

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new season of Fortnite is now live, and it brings Fallout, Magneto, plenty of nitrous oxide, and some Mad Max-esque flair to the battle royale. Titled "Wrecked," Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows last season's Greek Gods-themed season with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more. 
"A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland," an Epic Games blog post reads. "The 'Wasteland Warriors' have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they've already established." 
We'll break down those new locations and more below.

We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the "what if" questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it's the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…]]></summary>

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

        <updated>2024-05-23T18:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.
For more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate "the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers". The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre.

The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). 
For more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week. Read all about it here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a twist of fate I've mentioned in some recent Destiny 2 news posts, I am fully back into Destiny. Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

You nod with solemn respect and you say, "Alice". An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

They’re also thinking about a sequel - probably not much of a surprise given the first game has sold well on just the one platform, by all accounts - while working on a new game that should also be headed to PC, codenamed Project Witches.

Its strategy fundamentals were already strong enough to impress me in 2022 that it's been quite tricky to even remember what's changed. But there's more of it, and although after much reflection I think it's not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It's great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase "by Ernest Cline" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it's time for Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic's review* incredibly annoying?

Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love building games, but it's not that often that put one down and feel particularly tempted to get straight back into it again. Of Life And Land is one of those, but thankfully not so much so that it threatens to consume my every waking moment.
It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it's lovely.

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night's work. There is a catch though.

I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.)
