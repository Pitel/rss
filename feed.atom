        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elementary, my dear Tav
Baldur's Gate 3 is still a ways away. But for those who want a little bit of the world before August arrives, Larian Studios is hosting an online murder-mystery RPG called Blood in Baldur's Gate leading up to release.
Set 15 years before the events of Baldur's Gate 3, Blood In Baldur's Gate sees the city dealing with a series of killings. With a scarce trail of hints and info to go on, players will need to figure out how and why the killings are happening, before the culprit strikes again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aK5_aMkzoM
To do so, players can investigate different areas of the map, by voting where to head next. So far, only a handful have been unlocked. But the idea seems to be that players can theorize, decide amongst themselves, and determine the course of the investigation through democratic means.
It's a fun experiment, and I'm curious to see how it ties into the full Baldur's Gate release. Seeing as there's a decent amount of time between this murder mystery and the start of Baldur's Gate 3, it could encompass a number of aspects, from the new game or its predecessors.
Return to Baldur's Gate
After many years, the Baldur's Gate series returns under Larian Studios. The Divinity development house has been steadily working on the massive RPG for a few years now, and the full release is set to launch on August 31 for PC and PlayStation 5.
Notably, Xbox is not out of the picture. Larian is working on it, but isn't quite ready to make an announcement as of yet. Still, with Final Fantasy XVI out this week and Baldur's Gate 3 in August, with Starfield just beyond it, RPG fans certainly have a lot to look forward to.

We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £900 to £750 in the US (no ticking required).

Back in May, Oddsseeker completed a study on what video game communities on Reddit have the most toxic potty mouths. It also shows who, among the fanbases, has the best vocabularies, particularly when it comes to variety and profanity. So, that’s important.
This is certainly not a scientific study, but it is a fun one. It looks at “366,904 Reddit posts from the last year across 25 popular video game subreddits,” and pulls data to show who are the most toxic. So, let’s take a look.
That’s an interesting thesaurus

So what the heck is Crash Team Rumble?
Despite the weird and somewhat pointless monetization angle (which we'll get to), the standard $29.99 edition (yes, this is not free-to-play) is a much simpler package than it seems on the surface. Crash Team Rumble is a 4v4 battle game that asks two competing teams…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe it should be called Eighth-Life instead of Half-Life...
We've pretty much had to accept the fact that Half-Life 3 is never going to happen. That's... fine, I guess? We still have the original two games, plus Alyx for those of you who have a VR headset. Over the years, fans have been challenging themselves to finish the Valve FPS series in eye-wateringly quick times, and there's a new one that puts a number of runs to shame.
Recently, the YouTube channel SourceRuns (via PCGamesN) uploaded a Half-Life 2 speedrun, specifically of Episode Two, that clocks in at a staggering 9:46. Completed by speedrunners jorik and qv2b, the run is the culmination of 196 segmented pieces, which have been spliced together to produce this insanely quick time. It's definitely worth a watch.
https://youtu.be/j2N0FJ0dhAw
Once the game starts, you'll see just how much both players are able to skip past huge chunks of the game using exploits. In fact, much of the actual run itself takes place during the final battle at White Forest. Here, the action really slows down as Gordon Freeman defends the area from a Strider attack. Evidently, players haven't found a way to jump past this part that doesn't involve doing the actual fight.
However, at the time of writing, jorik and qv2b's video has not been featured on speedrun.com. This could be because they use a modded version of Episode Two, which removes the cutscenes, thereby reducing the time automatically. However, qv2b is second on the leaderboard, having achieved a time of 31:12:850 a year ago.
Half-Life 2 is easily one of the most influential FPS games of all time, almost surpassing the impact of its 1998 predecessor. To see people zooming through the game, (and its expansions), in unbelievably quick fashion shows how skilled some have become at guiding our mute scientist hero.

We were a bit heartbroken to hear that Ubisoft was "disappointed" in sales for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, though it's fair to say the developer had a bit of a rough 2022 all around. Now, in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz (via VGC), CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that he thinks the game may have "released too early" and should've waited for a new Nintendo console.
In the discussion, he talks about the developer's future (following Ubisoft's Summer Game Fest appearance and showcase) and his thoughts on the space-faring sequel. And in an interesting comment, Guillemot reveals that the developer received some sage advice from Nintendo: "that it's better to do one iteration on each machine".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.

The three main shmups in Taito's 'Ray' series will be flying onto Switch as a part of a special digital collection titled Ray'z Arcade Chronology from 30th June.
Not to be confused with the RayStorm X RayCrisis HD Collection that was revealed back in April, this collection consists of the two HD games and the original trilogy of RayForce, RayStorm and RayCrisis for those who want to see where it all started for the classic shmup series.

Easily one of the most bizarre news hits of 2023 was the reveal that Studio Retroware was adapting forgotten '90s cartoon Toxic Crusaders for a brand new scrolling brawler, which is currently in development for PC and console platforms. And if you had already grabbed your mop 'n' bucket in anticipation of this release, then this weekend brought with it a ton of good news for you.
First and foremost, a demo for the still-in-development scrap is currently available on PC as part of the Steam Next Fest event, giving fans a limited window with which to see how the new scrapper is shaping up. All you need do is go and download the trial from the Steam platform, and you're good to check out the street-cleaning action from Toxie, Yvonne, Junkyard and co. Righteous!

From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.

While development is still going on, the team of volunteers behind the Skyrim/Oblivion mod Skyblivion has just a milestone, celebrating eight years of "non stop work". However, the dedicated modders are not through yet, though it's looking like the crew may be ready to launch sometime in 2025.
If you've been keeping an eye on the Skyblivion Twitter page, you'll have seen a series of screenshots go up, showing the current progress of the modification. Many have been hoping the Elder Scrolls fan project was nearing completion by now, but there's still a ways to go, it seems. But that's okay. It looks like it's going to be worth it.
https://twitter.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1671071612718784513
For those of you who don't know, Skyblivion aims to bring a complete — though unofficial — remake of Oblivion to the Skyrim engine, thereby giving it a more modern look. Of course, at this point, TES5's Creation Engine is also showing its age, but it will still give the 17-year-old Bethesda RPG a fresh coat of paint. It is, after all, a mammoth task that's being made a that's being coordinated by some very passionate fans.
The fact that there's been continuous work on it for the past eight years puts the project back to 2015. However, according to the Skyblivion website, development officially started in 2012 with version 0.1. In 2014, the project entered a more stable phase, and things have been progressing since then.
The best part about it is it's going to be completely free once it releases. The only stipulation is that if you do want to play it, you'll need legitimate copies of both Skyrim and Oblivion, as well as all official DLCs. But that's a small price to pay for what's likely to be one of the most ambitious fan-made mods of all time. You can also join the Skyblivion Discord server to stay up to date.

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

In their first Campfire Chat stream since release, members of the Diablo 4 development team sat down to highlight some big upcoming changes to popular action-RPG. The primary focus of the one and a half hour livestream was the near future of Diablo 4.
Let's be honest here: Diablo 4 end-game is in a weird spot right now. One of the biggest features, Nightmare Dungeons, is currently practically useless to do. In the current state of the game it's simply more efficient to spam run non-Nightmare versions of the dungeons for more experience and rewards. Thankfully, Blizzard has some changes in mind to make Nightmare Dungeons a more rewarding experience.

What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The summer ain't over yet
We've seen several major publishers showcase their big streams in the month of June, and now, it's Nintendo's turn. A new Nintendo Direct is set to air on June 21, 2023.
Announced this morning on social media, Nintendo will host the new Direct at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET on its video channels. You can watch along through the embed below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7t5jnpkCkI
As for content, Nintendo says there will be "roughly 40 minutes" of information on Nintendo Switch titles, mostly launching this year. A specific focus is Pikmin 4, one of Nintendo's already announced titles set to launch on July 21, just a month after the Direct. No other games were specified in the tweet.
The year ahead for Nintendo
There is space ahead for Nintendo to fill with some new game announcements. Outside Pikmin 4 and the roll-out of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, there isn't too much on Nintendo's docket at this point in time.
Hopefuls are likely crossing their fingers for either Mario or Samus to make an appearance with a brand-new game. Metroid Prime 4 has been sitting on the sidelines for a while, and speculation always seem to swirl around Directs about its next appearance.
There's no shortage of third-party or indie hopefuls either. Square Enix often has news to share at these events, games like Metal Slug Tactics have been quiet for a while, and of course, there's always Silksong.
With Nintendo looking at the year ahead, I'm personally hoping for some firm dates set and titles locked for the coming fall. PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Ubisoft, and many others have already announced held their summer streams. This is, judging by the relative time-frame, a Direct that would've lined up with E3. So my own hope is for at least one or two E3-caliber reveals.
We'll find out tomorrow during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.

Blizzard Entertainment's maligned mobile battler Diablo Immortal is now one year old, and despite launching under a hail of negative press and fan derision, the microtransaction-filled dungeon crawler has still successfully raked in over half a billion dollars in its launch year.
The free-to-play mobile title was first announced at BlizzCon 2018, in an infamous segment that led to boos and jeers from those in attendance, with one fan famously asking the developers if the announcement was an "out-of-season April Fool's joke". Principal designer Wyatt Cheng's remark of "Do you guys not have phones?" only served to further sour the mood. Upon release, critics lambasted the title for its heavy monetization mechanics, with the game also receiving a low user rating on Metacritic. An early controversy involving an "Immortal" gem saw one law firm consider filing suit.

Still, as the old axiom proves time and again, The Online World is not The Real World, and the past 12 months have seen Diablo Immortal pull in just over $525 million USD in revenue from around 22 million total downloads, (as noted by the number crunchers at data.ai). Diablo Immortal is the 15th fastest title to hit this milestone, behind other mobile juggernauts such as Genshin Impact and Pokemon GO, and is currently the third most successful mobile MMORPG on the market.
Given the incredible launch success of recent mainline release Diablo IV, Blizzard Entertainment is clearly going to treat the unholy franchise with golden gloves going forward. The lucrative financial model that presently surrounds the franchise also makes Diablo a key item in Microsoft's ongoing efforts to purchase Activision Blizzard and its subsidiary properties.
Diablo Immortal is available now on iOS and Android platforms.

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life offers a slightly different take on the well-worn farming sim genre. As a new resident of the Forgotten Valley, you’re still here to revitalize an old farm and socialize with the townsfolk, but it’s that second aspect that takes a central role here. The point of your new life in this hamlet isn’t to save a farm or to stop the development of a theme park...
You’re here to make a life for yourself, one that is filled with love, family, and friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Wonderful Life, or A Terrible Remake?
What is the value of a remake? That's something we found ourselves asking as we played Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, a remake of the 2003 Harvest Moon game on GameCube, and a surprising addition to Marvelous/XSEED's catalogue of games. Should a remake of a game bring it up to today's standards, with modern additions like improved UI, extra features, and generally just more content? Should it be faithful to the original, and simply ported over to new platforms as-is? Or should it be an attempt to recreate the feeling of playing that game for the first time as a child?
We've been cautiously looking forward to and dreading this remake for a while, because while we're excited for the complete graphical overhaul, the new localisation, and the option to play as a male, female, or non-binary farmer, we also have a deep and sacred fondness for the original, and enough experience and wisdom from the past 20 years of gaming to know that it does not match up to our current standards of "fun". Do we want it to be dramatically overhauled, or presented in its imperfect state? We didn't know... until we played it.

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

There seems to be some kind of fleshy robot monster that says he'll "never escape," but that's all we've got to go off right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation owners will also get it early
While hype has definitely died down for Striking Distance Studio's The Callisto Protocol, fans will be pleased to hear that some content is coming very soon. As of next week, you'll be able to download "Final Transmission," which is said, as the title denotes, to be the final chapter of the game.
A post on the official Twitter account describes the closing content as "heart-pounding," and adds that PlayStation owners can exclusively get hold of the DLC 48 hours early. This means they can receive access to the title's climactic chapter on June 27, while other systems will see it release on June 29.
When it launched in December 2022, The Callisto Protocol was met with a string of negative reviews. While touted as a spiritual successor to Dead Space, Glen Schofield's latest horror outing was plagued with technical issues. The studio did roll out updates to try and patch some of the major ones out, but it was clear that fans were not impressed with the finished product on day one.
https://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1669804170734362625
At the start of 2023, the release received a New Game+ update, but outside that, not much has happened with The Callisto Protocol for some time now. For those that were after something that could plug a Dead Space-sized hole, Striking Distance's survival horror title left some feeling rather unfulfilled. Kind of like how Back 4 Blood was supposed to be a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead, but was, ultimately somewhat lacking.
In any case, for anyone who did enjoy The Callisto Protocol, The Final Transmission DLC is definitely something to look forward to. Perhaps Schofield and his team will move onto a new project after this.

Publisher NEOWIZ has announced that it is collaborating with Koei Tecmo in a partnership that will see the former's incoming adventure Lies of P cross swords with the latter's semi-recent release Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. The two Soulslike titles will crossover in curious fashion this September.
Outside of noting the collaboration, neither publisher offered any information whatsoever as to what the hook-up will entail, with details expected at a later date. While both games feature challenging action-RPG combat, they could perhaps not be more diametrically opposed in regards to characters, settings, and style — Though both games host a typically heavy and somewhat downbeat mood.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which launched in March of this year, sees a lone protagonist battle a bevy of demons and monsters from ancient Chinese folklore, set against the background of the Han Dynasty. Developed by Team Ninja, the adventure received critical praise across the board, earning a mighty 9/10 score from our own Chris Carter and selling over a million copies in its launch month.

Lies of P, a retelling of the Pinocchio fable, is currently turning heads thanks to a demo released on PC and console platforms last week. Developed by Round8 Studios, this Gothic tale has players guide young android, P, through a dismal, Belle-Epoque city, in search of answers to their own existence and on the run from a battalion of mechanized enemies. While feedback at this early stage has been a little divisive, Lies of P has great promise, and could prove to be one of the year's sleeper hits.
Lies of P launches this September on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Gaming can quite quickly become an expensive hobby. The non-stop conga line of fantastic games this year has made it harder than ever to play without hurting your wallet. Not every worthwhile experience has a price tag on it, however. With the following PS5 titles, you'll have a blast without spending a cent.

10. Apex Legends
When it comes to free-to-play games, fans of first-person shooters have more than enough to pick from. Apex Legends is a battle-royale style game featuring a cast of characters serving as either Recon, Support, Skirmisher, Assault, or Controller. With a good variety of guns and maps, it is a title that easily hooks players for hours at a time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next month's open beta for Frontier Developments' new Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin may be focused on testing its 1v1 multiplayer mode, but the Elite Dangerous studio have told me there's still plenty to look forward to in its single-player story campaign. I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

This week is another shortie because Twitter is once again broken and refusing to show all the weekend's posts, which sure feels ominous for the social media platform. The games are still good. Come on in for an immersive sim with a clever little technology trick, an adventure game set in a city on a giant octopus, the throwing of an egg, and more attractive and interesting indie games.

Something very mysterious is going on with a sadly obscure but fondly remembered gem from the Famicom era. It was built on the same game engine as the original Legend of Zelda, but unlike Link who decades on remains at the vaunted heights of gaming’s all-time greats, the protagonist of this bygone classic never even got a proper international release in its day, never mind a sequel.
Spare a thought, then, for the lone samurai Takamaru.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

Tales & Tactics, in case you’ve forgotten, is best pitched as a mixture of Slay the Spire and Dota Auto Chess; in other words, it’s a fantasy roguelike (like StS), where you can pick up abilities, gear and whatnot during each run, with auto-battling combat (like Auto Chess) - except here it’s on a hex board.

In the month since its launch, players have found a variety of different glitches in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to make filling up the inventory that bit easier. With each patch that Nintendo has implemented, more of these glitches have been fixed, but that hasn't deterred some brave souls from finding newer and easier methods.
One such glitch, lovingly called the 'frozen meat glitch' (don't worry, you'll see why) is quickly proving to be a speedy way of getting yourself a boatload of rupees with very little effort required (thanks, Kotaku). We have tested the method at Nintendo Life Towers and can confirm that it works as of ver.1.1.2 — but who knows whether it will make it through the next patch...

It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine Doom's creator playing your Doom map
If you haven't been keeping up with the Doom community lately, thenyou may have missed the unsettling .WAD file simply called "MyHouse." This has been doing the rounds on a number of YouTube channels, as fans work their way through this bizarre, unofficial map.
Now, the custom level has found its way to John Romero's computer. As the co-creator of the original Doom and Doom 2, Romero is something of a celebrity in the video game world. Helping to establish the early days of the FPS genre through a young id Software, the designer and programmer is as notable for his contribution to development as he is for his legendary long hair.
https://youtu.be/gIl_TqFJNO8
Seeing Romero play the "MyHouse" WAD file is an interesting spectacle, especially once he gets into the meat of the level. Without spoiling too much, MyHouse.WAD, created by Steve "Veddge" Nelson, is a rather unique take on classic Doom. Beginning as an innocent enough-looking mod that features the original game's iconic monsters, things soon take a bizarre turn.
Throughout the playthrough, which lasts just over an hour, Romero makes a few comments about the map, saying the word "cool" a helluva lot. It takes him a while to get going as he searches the titular house to make sure he's seen everything. Once it all kicks off, he seems very impressed with what Veddge has put together. Romero particularly likes the way the music alters as he progresses through the level.
While you could argue that he hasn't made as much of an impact since the early days of Doom and Quake, John Romero is still making games. In fact, he's still tinkering with Doom, having released the SIGIL episode in 2019 as well as working on SIGIL 2.
You can download MyHouse.WAD from Doom World if you want to try it for yourself (which we recommend you do). Note: you will need GZDoom in order to run it.

It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.

Hooded Horse has announced that the sequel to Goldhawk Interactive's tactical alien defense game, Xenonauts 2, will enter into Early Access on July 18.
Xenonauts was something of a 2014 fan apology for a perceived over-modernization of the series in Firaxis Game’s 2012 XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It stuck closer to the original 1994 version of the core gameplay, focusing on being an expansive and layered campaign against alien invaders.

Xenonauts 2 is looking to expand on that. Set in 2009 during a narratively extended Cold War, you’ll be clandestinely protecting Earth from extraterrestrial threats. This doesn’t look to be a continuation of Xenonauts, but rather a bigger and badder version of it, complete with 3D graphics and extra strategic depth. T…]]></summary>

The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What accomplishment doesn't he want to achieve?
Being one of the most recognizable faces in all of game development, Hideo Kojima is known for his outlandish ideas. While he rose to fame with the Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid franchises, his legacy continued with 2019's Death Stranding, a game synonymous with surrealism.
Now, the man himself has shown an interest in literally reaching for the stars. In a recent YouTube video, Hideo Kojima was asked by Geoff Keighley about achievements he still has in mind as he approaches 60. Speaking through an interpreter, the director said that he wants to go into outer space. The comment inspires some laughter from the audience. Kojima then goes on to say that he wants to make a game in space that the player can play while also floating about in the cosmos.
To hear the quote, skip ahead to around 23:19.
https://youtu.be/fAAbAAqHEic?t=1299
Anybody who knows the man and his work can say for certain that this is probably not a surprising dream. If you're a fan of his games, you may describe him as a "visionary." He's not always appreciated, but he definitely leaves an impact. Of course, seeing as Hideo Kojima likes to tease, it's entirely possible that this comment about going into space is a bit of a joke on his part.
Still, it's interesting to imagine what a game in space would be like, and if anyone's going to do it, it may as well be Kojima. However, we seem to be some way off before we regular folk can take trips to the stars. A video game that's been developed and is playable off-planet sounds kooky in a way that a lot of Kojima's ideas sound kooky. But, at the risk of bursting any bubbles, the prospect of such a game would probably be only suitable for the ultrarich. So Bezos could play it, but not you and I.
Besides, Kojima still needs to finish Death Stranding 2, not to mention that Xbox game he's said to be working on.

VRChat is a very interesting place. Perhaps it's not the first thing someone thinks of when it comes to a "VR Game," as the title originally started out as a social hub. It's birthed many memes and content through its years of life on the Oculus DK1 and Steam (and 4 on Meta Quest), but it's also evolved. Thanks to the introduction of Udon, VRChat's in-house coding language, players are now able to build more complex worlds. This has led to a slew of new experiences, and most importantly, very impressive games. Here's a collection of 10 worlds that you need to see if you ever log onto VRChat.

Oxenfree might be a scary game, but to me, it's also a summer game. It's about the in-between parts of your life, as you move from one major milestone to the next, and all the regrets and emotions that kick up in that time. So if Oxenfree was a summer vacation ghost story, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is a haunted summer gig.
Set five years after the first game, Oxenfree II follows Riley Poverly's return home to the coastal town of Camena. From the outset, it has a lot of summer gig vibes; you're tasked with heading to designated locations in Camena to set up radio transmitters, so that scientists can gather data about the strange radio signals happening around the area.
Obviously, this doesn't go so well. And what starts out as a chill job starts to feel uneasy and tense,…]]></summary>

Goooood morning friends and lovers, and welcome to a particularly sorchio Whatcha Been Playing? Summer has finally hit Blighty, bringing with it a face-melting heatwave and those Sticky, Sticky Nights that Kiss never sang about. I'm here for it, frankly, as it saves on heating bills and helps my body shed the excesses of meat. Of course, it makes sitting in the office writing about games a little uncomfortable, but as long as I have an excuse to eat ice-cream, I'll take it.
And speaking of Summer, we have reached the end of Summer Game Fest, just in time to start gearing up for Gamescom. Because now E3 is no longer around, these things roll out for weeks, and weeks, and weeks.

There's a certain feeling a good 2D Sonic game can elicit. The sense of zipping through levels at a pace that seems way too fast, as even the scrolling screen struggles to keep up with how fast the blue blur is moving, is a core memory for those who grew up around a Sega Genesis. And it's a feeling I got when I was playing the newest Sonic entry, Sonic Superstars.
Sonic Superstars is, to put it frankly, a classic Sonic game. It's 3D in models but 2D in design, though there are plenty of twists to change that up. The base foundation is familiar: you run, left to right, across the screen to hit the goal. Every so often, Dr. Robotnik / Eggman will roll in with an increasingly complicated machine you'll need to bonk your head against a few times.

Following a fortnight of run 'n' gun action and top-tier puzzling, we're going back to the stars with Hamster's favorite genre, the shmup — Available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's the Arcade Archives' newest entry, Taito's Megablast!
Released to the coin-op market in 1989, Megablast is one of a tidal wave of (admittedly forgotten) shmups that filled out smoky arcade centers up and down the country. While the action is fairly typical of the era, the storyline is one for the ages. Essentially, World Peace has been achieved on Earth, but the planet has been ravaged by an en masse disappearance of women. As it turns out, a dying intergalactic populace known as the Zancs cannot interbreed, and is instead abducting Earth's women in order to help it repopulate its own race. Big ol' yikes on that one, Taito.
And there's no sign of Roddy Piper anywhere.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlaXGd-SUbY&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays
And thus, fighter pilots Dawnson and Bogey are dispatched to confront the Zancs, speed up the extinction process, and bring back the planet's ladies, one of whom is Dawnson's own gal pal. What follows is standard horizontally-scrolling shmup action, depicted in Taito's typically oversized and kinda vulgar fashion. Power-ups can be gathered in order to boost the players' weaponry. Not explained is how our heroes plan to bring all of the women back to Earth in their two tiny, one-man vessels. But if ask too many questions, then the minute of this carefully crafted narrative begins to come undone. So don't.
Megablast is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.

2011’s Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective feels like it’s always been a bit of an oddball. The DS title was Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi’s shot to create something new, a “different kind of mystery” from the courtroom battles of Phoenix Wright and friends.
Though received well, sales seem mixed; it was a best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan the week of its release, but Capcom would later note it struggled. All of this helped build, at least in my perception, a cult-classic vibe around it. It wasn’t the most popular DS game, but those in the know who dug the DS highly valued it.
So that's where we find Ghost Trick now, as it's getting a revival on modern consoles. A demo is currently available, containing the first two chapters. And alongside a chance to play that section a…]]></summary>

NetherRealm Studios is rebooting the Mortal Kombat universe again with Mortal Kombat 1. The slightly confusingly named MK takes everything back to its origins, and then twists it. The characters and combat that have become enshrined in pop culture history are still here, but with adjustments both big and small.
This feeling of old nostalgia blending into new ideas kept coming to my mind while playing Mortal Kombat 1. I got a chance to play some matches of MK1 as part of Summer Game Fest 2023, climbing the classic towers with each of the characters available. And while MK is looking ahead to a new future, there's still a piece of it that loves to honor the past.

The story of Final Fantasy VII has expanded well beyond the bounds of the original PlayStation RPG. Through the spin-offs and the remake, the world of FF7 has become expansive. But rather than continue to build up, Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis feels like it's re-centering the lens on the original story, albeit with a few extra touches of its own.
Ever Crisis is a single-player mobile RPG that's billed as a bit of a retelling of Final Fantasy VII. It's a chapter-structured RPG that will go back over the events of the original game, alongside Crisis Core and some new story elements included from FF7 Remake writer Kazushige Nojima.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. 
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space.

Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time. 
What kind of games do you want to see Houser and Absurd Ventures make? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just one week after Diablo 4's first level 100 Hardcore character was killed by a lost connection, the game has brutally (and unfairly) claimed another Hardcore character. Unlike Carn's Barbarian, Quin69's Druid wasn't level 100 yet, but he was pretty darn close at level 91. His Druid had 172 hours and 50 minutes of play time. That's more than a week's worth of playing and the game's only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we're including early access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 
More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 


A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 
Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage. 
Are you going to check out Fire Emblem next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

Alice even made up for her recording absence by pre-emptively tying Nate to a chair and forcibly making him watch trailers, like that bit in A Clockwork Orange but with "WORLD EXCLUSIVE" flashing up every thirty seconds. Still, we keep it light by focusing on the games we actually like the look of, from The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Starfield, Nova Roma to Dungeons of Hinterberg.

According to a press release, the sequel is due out in early 2025, so about a year and a half away as it stands, and you'll of course be able to pick it up on Steam when it does. Come and watch its reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dambuster Studios have offered up a rough roadmap of what we can expect from the pair of upcoming Dead Island 2 story expansions. The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

I'm exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner. When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier at the end of May, one of things game director Mounir Radi told me about during my visit was how relieved he felt after showing Mechner a very early prototype. And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that "what I've seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

The new mode joins the game as part of its 1.4 update, and looks to be all about what it says on the tin - being creative! Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

So, I've gone and played another Sonic haven't I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year's Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love it. If you don't, there's no doubt in my mind you'll think it's agony.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

This 32-inch curved VA monitor offers a mighty 4K resolution, 165Hz refresh rate and a Mini LED backlight that provides superb, almost OLED-like HDR performance - without the burn-in potential or agressive brightness limiters that often feature on OLED panels. Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it's a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store.

Following its DS release, the game was ported to iOS devices, but later this month, it will land on consoles for the first time. Ghost Trick will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 30 where it will receive a visual upgrade and the first opportunity to play it without a touch-screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.
Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 


We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."]]></summary>

This series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. 


Dead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. 
For more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its reveal during Xbox Games Showcase, Capcom have given us a few details on their upcoming game Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess. When it was first announced on Sunday, we knew very little about the game other than it looks very pretty, and we've been eager to know more ever since. The game also opened Capcom's own showcase the next day, where the same trailer was shown and we didn't get any new information on it. Very enlightening. But luckily, some more details have dripped through, which we've summarised below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LA is an amazing, if tremendously grey place. Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?
Having seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.

Even next to its wonky performance on desktops, it ran truly dreadfully on the Valve handheld, leading to the Steam custodians themselves slapping it with an Unsupported rating. Following yesterday’s v1.1.0 patch, however, it’s in much better technical shape, and has swapped that miserable grey Unsupported badge for a reassuringly green Verified one.

It’s a daft, yet competitive combo of the two in which you move chess pieces around a board (yer check mate) and then transition to a side-on fighting game where your pieces beat the shit out of each other (yer showdown) to determine who stays on the board. Does it deserve those eyeballs, then? After playing an early version of it myself, I sure think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier to play Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown the other week, the developers spoke extensively how about anime and comic books had been a big inspiration for them in creating the game's visuals. As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games. So I put the question to art director Jean-Christophe Alessandri and game director Mounir Radi after my demo session.

Big words! Exciting words. As announced yesterday, we'll get to judge for ourselves when it comes out on October 3rd.

After six years of massive open-world RPGs, Ubisoft’s long-running Assassin’s Creed franchise is returning to its stealth-based, dense city roots with Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the more I see of it, the more excited I get for October. I’ve enjoyed the series’ foray into RPGs over the years, but 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which took me more than 100 hours to roll credits on, left me exhausted and burnt out with what Ubisoft had done to a franchise whose games previously took 20 hours to beat. 
After a recent preview event that featured new gameplay and details about Mirage,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty will have multiple endings, CD Projekt Red have confirmed, but interestingly it will also add in a brand new ending for the base game, too. Game director Gabe Amatangelo recently spoke to WCCFTech about the upcoming DLC, detailing when it takes place in the Cyberpunk 2077 timeline and how it fits into the story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like Xbox really wants Starfield to be as bug free as possible, as apparently every QA staff member is working on the game. This comes from Giant Bomb, who spoke with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty and Xbox boss Phil Spencer. The two spoke about a range of topics to do with Xbox as a whole, but Booty notably claimed that Starfield would be the Bethesda game with the least amount of bugs the developer has ever shipped.

While you don't need to like metal to enjoy the game, it does add something. So now Hellsinger offers a poppier experience with a new DLC letting you perform violence to the sounds of Gorillaz, Depeche Mode, Icona Pop, and more. Oh, and Down With The Sickness is in there too because hell, why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a proper look at Starfield (which my brain autocorrects to "Garfield" every single time I read it) on Sunday thanks to a dedicated 45 minute long presentation that showcased the game's various systems, planets and characters in granular detail. 45 minutes is a long time to devote to one video game, you could argue. Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? 
Anyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones still doesn't have a release date, but Ubisoft have now announced that the game will have a closed beta in August. The developer announced the news that the much-delayed game would be receiving a beta alongside a… sea shanty, which is obviously fitting given the whole it being a pirate game thing, but is maybe the funniest way of doing such an announcement for a game that seems like it's never coming out. You can currently sign up to potentially join the closed beta on the game's website, with the test set to take place August 25-28.

They say this will leave them a "stronger, more efficient company". Their purchases include Gearbox, Crystal Dynamics, Volition, the rights to The Lord Of The Rings, and so many more. Embracer own 138 studios and have over 16,500 people working for them, and it's not clear how many will remain afterwards.

The news came in the form of a short trailer that did show off some very brief snippets of gameplay, opening up with an honestly quite fun sequence showing the young girl we've seen in previous trailers making a cute drawing apologising for the indefinite delay.

While the release date for the first batch of PvE content, titled Overwatch 2: Invasion, dropped over the weekend during the Xbox showcase, it wasn't until late last night that Blizzard shared some more specific details, most notably that you'll have to fork over $15 in order to even play it.

Blizzard's Overwatch 2 dev team ignited the community last month when it announced that the Hero Missions, part of the PvE content that was announced alongside the game in 2019, were canceled. However, not all of the PvE content was axed. I traveled to Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine, California to be the first person outside of the company to get my hands on the upcoming Story Missions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pragmata may be the most mysterious title in Capcom's upcoming portfolio of games, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future. A brief update during the Capcom Showcase confirmed the game's release was slipping out of 2023 and into the unknown.


The video shows the enigmatic, glowy-eyed little girl (apparently named Diana) innocently drawing as her decidedly adult astronaut(?) guardian fends off mechanized attackers before he whisks her away from danger. We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...
It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.
Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.
Thank you for your continued support.
-The Pragmata Development Team
Pragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a "near-future dystopian world on the moon," according to Capcom. The game was originally slated for 2022 before getting delayed to 2023. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Since the reveal of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2021, I’ve been curious how The Division developer Ubisoft Massive will take on this property, one of the most financially successful movie franchises in the world, and translate it into a video game. Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on. 
Most interesting to me, instead of controlling an Avatar, which is meant to resemble Pandora’s native Na’vi,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft decided to round out its showcase with a closer look at a game it revealed during the Xbox showcase yesterday – Star Wars Outlaws. The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.
The demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind. It's exciting to see a companion like that as more than just a cute, (hopefu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Ubisoft's Foward event, we got a new look at gameplay from Assassin's Creed Mirage – a throwback of sorts to the long-running series' roots. 
In the footage, we see a few assassinations, a chase, and our protagonist Basim taking on missions. There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.
Check out the gameplay footage below.


Notably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.
You can also check out a new trailer for the game below.


Assassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.]]></summary>

First up is Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, which comes to Meta Quest 2 and 3 later this year. The game lets players control Ezio (AC II), Connor (AC III), and Kassandra (AC: Odyssey) in first-person through an original story that lets players parkour, hide in the shadows, and assassinate targets in the more immersive avenue that VR provides. Check out the CG trailer below. 


We next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.]]></summary>

Players will explore the city of Honolulu, drive up volcanic rocks, and along beachsides. It seems clear that The Crew Motorfest has drawn at least some inspiration from the destination-focused gameplay of other racing games like Forza Horizon.
The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.
The Crew Motorfest is targeting a beta in July, so players should be able to get a better sense of the racing action in just a few weeks. The game is out on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
XDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora kicked off Ubisoft Forward with a new trailer providing our best look at the game yet.
Frontiers of Pandora follows the narrative blueprint of the films in that you control a Na’vi to protect your world from militaristic human invaders. The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.


The game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. 
We also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The second segment is a  2-hour long action-focused mission centering on Clive’s infiltration of a fort. While the progress from this section will not transfer to the final game, it does provide a hefty sample of the game’s stylish-action-inspired combat.

During Summer Game Fest 2023, I had a chance to get a behind-closed-doors look at Alan Wake, the highly anticipated sequel 13 years in the making.
The road to Alan Wake 2 was full of speed bumps involving publishing rights and finding the right ideas, hence the 13-year gap. "We've been trying and now finally everything just clicked into place," co-director Sam Lake says. "We got the publishing rights of the original game back, so we were in a position to create a remastered version for the PlayStation audience as well as a wider audience. And we were trying to d…]]></summary>

Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.


The update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.
Vampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.]]></summary>

Despite an extremely rocky launch, I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 a lot. I beat it around its release in 2020, and I’ve checked in a few times to see how the CD Projekt Red’s post-launch work has improved the game, but those check-ins were always a few hours. I’d drive around, shoot some enemies, and listen to Run The Jewels on the in-game radio. Satisfied with my V’s ending, I didn’t have a reason to return to the meat of the ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clockwork Revolution made its debut at today’s Xbox Games Showcase via a trailer that set the stage for its steampunk-flavored RPG action.
The first-person adventure puts you in control of a woman hailing from the steam-powered Victorian-era city of Avalon who discovers a time machine, along with the revelation that the city – and its brutal oppression of the lower class – is the result of intricate time manipulation by the villainous Lady Ironwood. To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. 


The game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. 
Clockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those in the market for an Xbox Series S with more storage, Microsoft has unveiled a 1-terabyte SSD model of the console that launches on September 1.


This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.
As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming. 
What do you think of this new version of the Series S? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

From overall visual styling to UI  and fonts, it’s clear that the team at Studio Zero is trying to borrow from that celebrated series.
But make no mistake, this is a brand new game and universe. Fans of the surreal and surprising narrative beats of the Persona series will certainly find a lot to love, even as the new setting may be enough to invite new players into the mix.

During the PC Gaming Show, Behaviour Interactive and Lunarch Studios revealed Islands of Insight today. I watched a 20-minute gameplay demo to learn more about this idyllic open-world puzzle game. While I still have many questions, especially concerning the game’s shared world cooperative multiplayer aspect, Islands of Insight is something I look forward to going hands-on with in the future.
Behaviour Interactive pitches Islands of Insight to me as an “epic open shared world, puzzle adventure game,” and I’m immediately intrigued.

Overwatch 2 was originally created to add this exact new content to the beloved hero shooter, but months went by without any updates on story or PvE game modes. Last month, the developers updated the community with the news that they wouldn't be able to deliver the content initially planned, specifically the Hero mode with dedicated talent trees. Overwatch: Invasion is the first wave of the content that remains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
