Where to get pouches in KCD2


You can purchase pouches from Tailors or Traders, found in almost every area on the map. These merchants won't be available at the story's beginning, so ensure to complete the tutorial in Troskowitz first. This includes objectives like burying a body and brewing a healing potion. Once you are free to travel, you can find the first merchant to the left of the Trokskowitz Tavern.

While Guardians will largely be slaying out foes and handling mini-objectives in The Nether, the activity throws a twist into the mix: players can't heal themselves through traditional means.


This no-doubt throws Destiny 2's healing-capable Warlocks into disarray, but it also means that players can't just hang around and wait for health to regenerate on any Class. Instead, if players want the ability to heal themselves and the rest of the Fireteam, they'll need to make some conscious decisions about their loadout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After parting ways with Sir Hans in Troskowitz at the beginning of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you'll officially enter the open-world portion of the game. You'll overhear guards talking about some fresh graves nearby. Here is where you can find the fresh graves near Troskowitz in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.





Fresh Graves location near Troskowitz


You can find the fresh graves to the southwest of Troskowitz near the tree line. Head west out of Troskowitz then south down the road until you pass the farm fields and the hill starts going down towards the trees. As you approach the trees, you will find a couple of graves amongst the bushes and rocks scattered near the treeline. These are the fresh graves you are looking for.


Should you rob the graves?


You have the option of robbing the fresh graves, both for free loot and also to acquire information as to who lies inside them. Keep in mind you will need a Spade to dig up the fresh graves, as you cannot do so with your bare hands. You can buy a Spade from the merchant in Troskowitz, though it will cost you 6.7 Groschen. I simply went outside the town and collected a bunch of Sage and Chamomille to trade with the merchant for the Spade. You only get 0.1 Groschen per, but you get several each time you gather.


I would recommend robbing the graves because this early on in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 you have pretty much nothing, and the loot is worthwhile. For example, one grave has a Von Bergow Knight Shield in it, which has 263 Defence but is also worth 249.6 Groschen, a massive value this early on. You'll also get a Bearded Axe and Flanged Mace, both of which are better weapon options than your current Hunting Sword.


If you choose to rob the graves, make sure you loot the bodies in both of them. One is located near the big rock closer to the road, while the other is under the small tree with a cross hanging from it.

Destiny 2 really needs a win right about now. The live-service game hasn't had a good year, with mediocre, bug-filled Episodes replacing the old Seasonal model. The hope was that Bungie was saving the best for last, that Heresy would re-inspire some faith in players after months of negative press and controversies. However, the launch of Episode: Heresy did not inspire confidence, coming online with a slurry of error codes preventing most players from doing much more than reaching Orbit.

How to evolve Cosmoem into Solgaleo or Lunala in Pokémon Go


You'll need to spend 100 Cosmog Candies to evolve Cosmoeum, but don't get too happy with your trigger finger once you finally net the one-hundredth Candy. Whether Cosmoeum evolves into Solgaleo or Lunala depends on whether you evolve it during the day or at night. As I'm sure you can guess, evolving Cosmoem during the day will transform them into Solgaleo, and doing the same at night will turn them into Lunala.

We're sure you already know the story, but briefly, Nintendo had agreed to work with Sony on the SNES' disk expansion, but the Big N secretly went behind the partner's back and announced its intentions to work with Phillips just moments before Sony would unveil the console. Talk about drama, eh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mason Mount Flashback SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the SBC to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


This is the first time that Mount has received a special card in Ultimate Team this year, and this version goes back to his hay days at Chelsea. To play with the item, you'll have to complete all the tasks that are part of the SBC. Let's take a look at the easiest way to complete the challenge, and if it's worth your resources at all. 


EA FC 25 Mason Mount Flashback SBC tasks


The Mason Mount Flashback SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



Task 2 - Premier League



Min. 1 Players from: Premier League


Min. Team Rating: 86



EA FC 25 Mason Mount Flashback SBC solutions


Here's a set of solution you can use to unlock the latest Mason Mount card in Ultimate Team. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10 85-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Premier League



Saka 87


Hasegawa 84


Gakpo 83


Carpenter 83


Pajor 87


Swanson 87


Palacios 84


Popp 87


Marquinhos 87


Icardi 83


Iago Aspas 84



The new Flashback is priced pretty decently at just 100,000 coins worth of fodder, but the main issue lies elsewhere. As a card, this Mount item has decent stats and playstyles, along with 5* Weak Foot. However, we are now in a meta that is dominated by TOTY cards with 3 PlayStyles+. Having cards with two good PlayStyles+ is pretty important, which begs the question about why EA Sports has released this card at all. 


The only viable option with this card is to complete the SBC, and hope for a future evolution which allows you to improve its stats and playstyles. Otherwise, most players already have better options in their existing squads.

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of search-action game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map.

With consoles from the 80s now approaching the forty-year-old mark, and gamers wanting to get their hands on '90s consoles, it seems prices aren't going to slow down anytime soon. So which are the cheapest retro consoles to collect, to avoid breaking the bank?


The cheapest retro consoles to collect


Keep in mind that the prices we indicate here are based on eBay auctions from the past few months and can be heavily subject to fluctuations. Take those with a grain of salt and just as generic references to have a vague idea of what you are going to pay, depending on the conditions of the consoles you are looking for as well.

Get Pebbles Back


Your first option for getting a horse is to find and get Henry's faithful steed Pebbles back. Yep, Pebbles returns from Kingdom Come: Deliverance and is a horse you can get in the sequel as well.


Early on you'll get a side quest called The Jaunt in the village of Semine. Before you can actually delve into the side quest, you'll need to acquire a horse. On the eastern side of Semine is a massive horse stable. Visit the Horse Trader there and you will see none other than Pebbles!

Earlier today, Nintendo released its latest quarterly financial update for FY2025 and the findings were... much as you might expect. Sure, Switch crossed the big 150 million units milestone, but Nintendo also lowered its sales forecast for the second quarter in a row as interest continues to drop.
Now, you might assume that the drop in Switch sales is a natural product of Switch 2 anticipation — we officially know that the console is coming this year, after all — but, as Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors shortly after the report was published, you can't put all the blame on hardware hype (thanks, Eurogamer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps starring Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is finally out, and it looks pretty neat. Unfortunately, however, Disney decided to pair that cool Nostalgia trip to Marvel's golden age with this poster:


Image via Disney


Catch anything strange? Upon first glance, the poster's only fault is the blandness permeating its every pixel. If you go all CSI on it, though, you'll find a bigger issue. As pointed out by Wayne Talbot on Bluesky, this weak sauce poster was actually the work of what tech bros call a highly advanced AI.




Sadly, Gen AI is already decent enough at generating human fingers most of the time, but that's been the go-to way of spotting whether an image has been generated via AI for a while. The four fingers of the person holding that flag are a dead giveaway. This means Disney not only used AI, it also couldn't be bothered to use the best type of Gen AI — or didn't use it very well.


Even worse, Disney might've tried to correct this mistake by making it dumber. Gen AI is known for creating monstrosities anywhere it goes, but it's not used to repeating people's faces — it usually just steals and clones the faces of two different people! So, this seems to suggest Disney used Gen AI to make the poster, then had some poor artist dig into that crap to cover up some issue by doubling a poor woman's face.


We'll likely never know exactly what transpired behind the scenes to cause this poster to come out the way it did, but we're pretty sure it was stupid.


Image via Disney/Wayne Talbot


I never thought I'd say this, but I sure do miss the time when Marvel movies had posters that sucked ass in a completely normal and non-insidious way.




Well, at least the trailer still looks pretty good.




The Fantastic Four: First Steps releases on July 25.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari is digging into its catalog of classics for another revival. This time it's the 1976 arcade game Breakout, which is coming back in style to spare thanks to the folks behind the BIT.TRIP series.


Developer Choice Provisions' take on the arcade block-buster is titled Breakout Beyond, and at a glance, it's reminiscent of a few revivals that have opted for similarly explosive aesthetics. The gameplay itself is built upon the same core concept, but Beyond fires from its unassuming paddle with ricocheting lightning bolts and dynamic bursts of fireworks.


Oh yeah, and Breakout now plays horizontally, so there's that, too. Here's a look at how the colorful means of progression looks in action: 




Movement and destruction looks suitably chaotic despite the simplistic underpinnings, and it's all set to the rhythm of procedural audio and visual effects. As players move across the screen, they'll be tasked with building up combos to break through barriers so they can clear a path to the final goal. Special blocks are scattered throughout the arena, too, providing bonuses like brick-clearing explosions, protective barriers, and a laser cannon. 


Breakout Beyond boasts 72 levels in total, all of which are available to challenge solo or cooperatively with another player. From the short burst we get to see in the above trailer, co-op looks to make the proceedings even more chaotic, with the second player positioned to ricochet side-by-side or strategically placed behind or in front of their partner. 


There's no concrete release date at this time other than being due out "later this year." When Breakout Beyond launches, it'll be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Atari VCS.

Henry will eventually start having blurry vision before leading to you dying and having to reload from the most recent checkpoint. Here is how you can stop bleeding in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.





How to stop bleeding in KCD2


The primary way to stop bleeding in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is to use Bandages. Go into your inventory to the Utility section, select the Bandage, then hit the 'E' key to use it. You will then get a pop-up window asking which body part you want to patch. In order to completely stop bleeding, you will have to patch up every body part that is not at 0%. Each Bandage you use will stop the bleeding on that body part.


It can take quite a few bandages to completely stop bleeding if you've…]]></summary>

Grab the Spade against the post near the body


As Bozhena suggested, you should grab the spade/shovel outside of the hut to dig the grave. Head outside then look to the left and you'll see a body lying near the garden. To the left of the body is a spade lying against a post. Grab the spade as you will need it to bury the grave.

Pick up the body and head towards the stream


Now that the spade is in your inventory, head over to the body. Before picking it up, hold the 'F' key to loot it for any goodies. Then, hold the 'E' key to pick up the body. Head immediately out of the gate that surrounds the house and down towards the stream. 


Dig the grave and bury the body


Once you reach the stream, you'll see soft ground under your feet in the surrounding area. Put the body down then hit the 'E' key, which will automatically dig up a grave. Go back to the body and hold the 'E' key to pick it back up, then interact with the freshly dug grave by hitting the 'E' key. After a few seconds, the body will be buried and this optional side quest will be complete.


Head back southwest to the Herbalist's hut and interact with the wash tub outside the hut to wash yourself clean of the stench. With this optional quest done, you're now ready to find the Sage and Chamomile and complete the Fortuna quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2!

What does Saviour Schnapps do?


In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, consuming Saviour Schnapps is how you save the game. While you can "quick save" at any time by going into the menu and choosing to save and exit, this is only meant to serve as an option if you are simply looking to exit the game. Your save will be created exactly where you exited the game, and once you continue the game, you'll be loaded in the same spot and the save will be deleted. The game also creates a save any time you sleep in a bed that you have permission to use.

Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

With last month's Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo teased something we'd all been waiting for (well, following weeks of leaks) — a potential 'mouse' mode. A little sneak peek at the optical laser, the Joy-Con swiftly rolling along a surface like a mouse.
There are a few obvious candidates for games that'd work wonders with a mouse controller, but the most apparent is next week's new release, Sid Meier's Civilization VII. So trust the folks over at IGN to ask developer Firaxis about its thoughts on the potential feature in an interview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We typically only get to hear the main cast of the original Metal Gear Solid games in one place when we're replaying the classics. Three of the key voice actors are having a bit of a reunion soon, however, thanks to a new Metroidvania called SteamDolls: Order of Chaos.


Appropriately enough, this one is billed as a stealth-action platformer, so we're still technically on a stealth mission. This particular mission is now set to enter Early Access on February 11. The main cast in the latest from French-Belgian studio The Shady Gentleman includes David Hayter as The Whisper alongside Christopher Randolph and Jennifer Hale. Anyone nostalgic for the staccato burst of a patrolling exclamation point will recognize those names as the respective voices behind Solid Snake, Otacon, and Naomi Hunter.


You can hear how their voices sound in the context of the gritty, shadowed world of SteamDolls in the new release date trailer below.




The Shady Gentleman first cooked SteamDolls up with inspiration from a comic book before taking the title to Kickstarter. Its campaign ended back in July 2020 with €94,828 pledged of a €30,000 goal, and the team originally had a projected delivery of May 2021. That didn't happen, but hopefully, the wait will have been worth it once it drops in a matter of days.


According to the announcement, players who dive into Early Access can expect to play through six chapters of the game. That adds up to around five to seven hours of content, and the devs are hoping to use the feedback from this period to further refine everything for the eventual 1.0 launch. A free demo is still available, too, so you can hop in and hear that gravelly Hayter tone you know and love right now.

Developer G.Rev may not be all that familiar to those who weren’t fully immersed in the shoot-'em-up scene of the early noughties. A boutique independent, it was assembled by former Taito employees who previously contributed to the likes of RayStorm and G-Darius. G.Rev’s most famous work, and the one that put it on the map, is Border Down: a wonderfully original 2003 shooting game for Sega’s Naomi arcade hardware and Dreamcast console. It was followed in 2006 by Under Defeat, switching from the horizontal to the vertical and trading sci-fi for a grounded militaristic theme.
Not to be confused with that other Dreamcast helicopter shoot 'em up, Psikyo’s Zero Gunner 2, Under Defeat pits pink-haired German soldier girls against the enemy forces of “The Union”. While any real-world similarities are dispelled by impossibly giant gunships torn from the pages of anime fiction, one of Under Defeat’s more interesting aspects is how hard-boiled it feels.

Atari has announced that the 1976 brick-breaking arcade classic Breakout is making a comeback. Breakout Beyond is being developed by Runner3 team Choice Provisions and sees the classic's vertical orientation getting flipped on its side.
As you can see in the reveal trailer above, the Pong-like paddles now slide up and down the left side of the screen (as opposed to the bottom in the original) and the screen scrolls right to the goal. Breaking bricks is still a big part of the score-chasing game, but it seems that Choice Provisions has made things a little spicier with scrolling and modern pyrotechnics, as well as some two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

Above, you'll find the first teaser trailer for 'Lost in Hyrule', an upcoming live-action fan film which has just opened its doors to Rupee donations on Kickstarter (or other, non-Hylian currencies, if you'd rather). According to the campaign page, the story takes place after the events of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, offering the filmmaker's take on "the untold conclusion to the Hero of Time’s saga". Mmm, lore.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier.

A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in 'pirate' libraries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

Its Smash Bros.-inspired platform fighter MultiVersus will shut down at the end of season 5, just a year after it’s bumpy return from live-service purgatory. The game will still be available to play offline, but there won’t be any refunds for players…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musi's initial attempt to force Apple to reinstate its music app to the App Store has failed. A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

Here is - in a sense of the word so loose I fear imminent smiting by a bellicose scribe god for typing it - a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nic says that RPG remake sequel Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is "uneven, unfocused, and unmissable". You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.

Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and Outriders studio People Can Fly will be co-developing Gears Of War: E-Day, the upcoming shooter in the long-running series of games about large men doing large violence at large bugs from behind medium walls. This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It's a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I'm too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I'm not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have surprise-released Ninja Gaiden 2: Black, an Unreal Engine 5 version of Xbox 360 hack-and-slasher Ninja Gaiden 2. It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-end prebuilt PC market is a battleground for premium prices, but catching a solid deal can save you a significant chunk of change. Case in point: Dell is offering the Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for $2,899.99, a full $1,000 off the usual price. It's a rare sight to see an RTX 4090 gaming rig dip below the $3,000 mark, especially given the recent uptick in standalone GPU prices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.

"Action Sack" is a returning playlist for the series.

From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen "věci na jistotu" jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>
