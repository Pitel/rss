There's been a historic discovery made within the 1994 Super Nintendo release Super Punch-Out!! today.
A Twitter account known as 'Unlisted Cheats' has uncovered a hidden two player mode in the game. To access this option, on the game's start screen you'll have to hold the 'Y' and 'R' buttons on the second player's controller and then press 'Start' or the 'A' button on the first player's controller.

With a second delay in effect, Marvel's Midnight Suns won't be showing up in October 2022 as previously planned, and even then, it'll have a scaled-back launch when it does arrive.
As it stands, 2K expects the tactical superhero game to land before the end of March 2023 — but that only goes for the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S versions. The other console versions, which are still on the way, don't have a release window yet. So if you've been keeping tabs on the Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox One editions of Midnight Suns, they're even further out. I hope they aren't ultimately canceled as we get closer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. 
Important update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED
August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom has Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

One of the coolest visuals in Elden Ring, the Walking Mausoleum, caught my eye long before we got to play the game or knew it by name — the stomping giant was in the first gameplay trailer, and I distinctly remember it setting off sparks in my imagination. In a trailer full of cool shit, it stood out to me; it got me wondering about the gameplay possibilities that could come out of an open-ended world designed by FromSoftware.
Months after exhausting the game (for now), I still think about these big boys.
A fan on Reddit, HoboSapient, shares my enthusiasm — and then some. They created a big, detailed, surprisingly heavy LEGO version of Elden Ring's Walking Mausoleum. (Thanks, PC Gamer.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because sure, why not
It looks like Pac-Man could be hitting the silver screen. A new report claims a film is in development, based on Pac-Man, and it's live-action.
The Hollywood Reporter says the project is in the works between Bandai Namco Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios. It's apparently based on an original idea from Chuck Williams of Lightbeam Entertainment, a producer on 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog.
Wayfarer was founded by Justin Baldoni and Steve Sarowitz, and was behind Disney+ feature Clouds. No further details have been reported on what direction this live-action adaptation of the arcade classic might take.
Bandai Namco, meanwhile, has seen a number of video game adaptations come and go. They've ranged from varying Tekken films to series and anime adaptations. Tekken itself is getting another iteration on Netflix later this month, with Tekken: Bloodline.

Puck Man to the rescue
Considering there isn't too much narrative fodder to work with, I have to wonder where exactly a Pac-Man movie goes. Maybe a comedy that imagines the Pac-Man world and its everyday action as a standard 9-to-5 world, like Wreck-It Ralph.
Or maybe it goes a darker, grim route, imagining Pac-Man as some grizzled ghost hunter. What if the "games" are put on by a higher power, and Pac-Man is in some kind of Squid Games situation, fighting to survive in a maze full of ghosts and dots?
Honestly, I have no clue. But since video game adaptations have shown absolutely no sign of slowing down in the near future, I'm down for whatever. Resident Evil has had multiple adaptations in the last few years, Castlevania keeps tearing it up on Netflix, and League of Legends struck gold with Arcane. If Mario and Sonic, are both returning to the silver screen, then Pac-Man should get a shot too.

This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

Sega's latest mini-console, the Astro City Mini V, has just been released, bringing 22 vertical shmups to people who may not have had access to many of these Japan-only, arcade-only titles before... but, let's be realistic, this teeny-tiny little cabinet is for the kind of hardcore arcade nerds that can afford to drop $180 on something this specific. No shame in that, though!
Unfortunately, as pointed out in multiple reviews (including our own Damien McFerran's review over on our new sister site, Time Extension), the input lag is extreme, marring the experience a fair bit. Here's how Damien describes it:

As part of this weekend's Evo festivities, Capcom released a new trailer showing off two of the characters headed to its upcoming sequel Street Fighter 6 — and while Juri needs no introduction, (yeah, I still gave her one), there is more intrigue to be found in the form of a SF6 newcomer, the vivacious Kimberly!
Representing the good ol' US of A, Kimberly is a young, energetic, and highly acrobatic woman who combines her love of music, paint, and martial arts to create street beats on her opponent's bonce. Graduating from college early due to her incredible aptitude talents, Kimberely tracked down Final Fight hero and erstwhile ninja Guy, who trained her in the lightning-fast art of Bushinryu.

After the excellent Two Point Hospital released on Switch moments before the world was rocked by a global pandemic, Two Point Studios are at it yet again with Two Point Campus. If the name hadn’t made it clear already, rather than running a hospital for money, Two Point Campus has you running a university campus… for money. Capitalism and management sims go hand-in-hand, what can you do? But does this freshman venture pass with flying colours, or is it little more than a dropout?
The premise begins very simply: you have a university campus where you can build classrooms, lecture halls, dormitories, student lounges, everything prospective uni-goers might want (and need) to graduate. But the trick is less about rinsing your younglings for all the cash that they carry and kicking them out the door as quickly as possible; instead, your reputation as a university is king, and struggling, unhappy, or failing students will result in fewer applications the following academic year. This leads to lower revenue, fewer resources to make things better for future students, and the inevitable debt that comes from frantically taking loans from Smell My Cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite time to embark
ARC Raiders, the debut effort from Embark Studios, is taking a little extra time to come together. The developer announced today that it has delayed ARC Raiders to 2023.
In a statement, the team says it appreciates support so far. "ARC Raiders is an ambitious game, and we will be using this extra time to expand the experience, and allow it to reach its fullest potential," reads the post on social media.
https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1556656803265609728
The studio says it will be going into more details about ARC Raiders as soon as it starts to more extensively test the game with players.
Invaders from outer space
First teased and then officially shown off at The Game Awards 2021, ARC Raiders is a co-op PvE shooter. Players will have to band together to fight off killer enemies from outer space.
It has a big retro-future vibe, in the same vein as Deathloop and the upcoming Rollerdrome. It's also got some notable industry names attached to its developer, Embark Studios.
Embark is headed up by former DICE CEO Patrick Söderlund, so it could have some similar ideas. And honestly, a co-op PvE game with a mix of outer-space and tinge of Battlefield sounds pretty alright to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKASgkxK1g
We haven't seen too much of ARC Raiders yet though, aside from what was shown at last year's Game Awards. It's third-person, and seems to have a pretty hefty amount of gunfire and explosions, as well as some fearsome and massive robots to take down. It's some borderline Earth Defense Force vibes, which I'll be honest, I'm here for! Big robots versus small soldiers sounds like a good time.
We'll see how the project comes together as Embark continues to work on it and show off more. Until then, we'll have to wait for the new year to see more of ARC Raiders.

With the release of Wave 2 of the Booster Course Pass, new is exactly what we're getting.
One of the courses featured in the Turnip Cup and Propeller Cup is new to the Mario Kart franchise, making its debut here before it pops up in Mario Kart Tour. I like the idea of Booster Course Pass players getting early access to these new tracks – because lord knows I'm never going back to MKT.

        <updated>2022-08-08T15:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take "some time" before the system is finished. 
While that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2's first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I'm proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I've bested it. I should say "we", as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie's highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

Recently, there have been staff comments alluding to the potential end of the Xenoblade series, but that's not exactly correct. Instead, the team is mostly referring to the end of the "trilogy," as a new email from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 director Tetsuya Takahashi (obtained by Nintendo Everything) sheds some more light on where the series is going from here.
Note that there is one spoilery element, which I have removed with the bold emphasis below:
Greetings to everyone who purchased Xenoblade Chronicles 3. This is Takahashi from Monolith Soft. Thanks to your support, we’ve released the third Xenoblade title, twelve years after the original Xenoblade was released for the Wii in 2010. Xenoblade 3 has been called the culmination of the whole serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

We all know that games on the 3DS and Wii U are scheduled to disappear when their respective eShops close down in March 2023, but you probably weren't expecting Switch games to disappear, too.
It turns out that the Nintendo Switch can only display up to 2,000 games at a time, and if you have any more than that, the ones that you haven't played for the longest time won't appear in your library. 2,000 might sound like a lot, but if you're the kind of person that downloads every demo, it's surprisingly easy to climb up to such a lofty number.

Monolith Soft's highly acclaimed JRPG may have fallen to 10th in the charts, but this does not serve to belittle its stellar opening week in which the game received the best UK launch of any title in the franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's still so much to learn about how Splatoon 3 will differentiate itself from the pack
In what will most likely be the last major update until launch, Nintendo has announced a Splatoon 3 Direct: debuting on August 10 at 6AM PT. That's in two days!
Somehow, Nintendo plans on spending "roughly 30 minutes" on the game, which is on the longer side for these sorts of micro/single game Directs. Even the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct was about 24 minutes, so they're clearly aiming high here. There are precedents though. Back in 2015 (!) Nintendo essentially had to sell people on a brand new franchise, and spent 33 minutes explaining the universe of the first game. Then a few years later for the sequel, that Direct was nearly 27 minutes long.
Either way, there's a lot we can still glean from another Direct, like:
Story (Return of the Mammalians)/lore info
Campaign structure
More multiplayer maps/weapons
Salmon Run (co-op) info
Secrets/extras like amiibo support
The last part is what I'm rooting for, and serves as perfect Direct material. That sort of mysterious tease is what gets all the speculation going once the video is done, and Nintendo is generally pretty good at it! Plus, I hope there's some form of amiibo support (even minor): as it stands, there's no mention of amiibo on the game's various regional store pages, which could be confirmation or an oversight.

More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:

August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

Evo 2022 saw Guilty Gear Strive, Street Fighter V, DNF Duel, Dragon Ball FighterZ, The King of Fighters XV, MultiVersus, and many, many other scrappers take to the stage and stream in global fashion, as players from all over the world gathered at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in their respective efforts to lay claim to being The Best of The Best.
And, against the backdrop of this utterly electrifying cacophony of violence, the biggest fighting game developers and publishers also took the opportunity to share with their fans exciting news, details, and updates pertaining to their current, upcoming, and (in some cases), former fighting ga…]]></summary>

Returning competitor Juri is a “sadistic thrill seeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes,” according to PlayStation. She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. 
For example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are new special moves but “…]]></summary>

Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe's Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don't often blend as well as this, and I'm disappointed that it hasn't got a bigger reception.

Back in June, the lovely Nintendo Life video team - comprised of Alex, Zion, and Felix - finally met up in person for the first time in like... ever. Not only that, but a few other friends and colleagues from Nintendo Life also joined in on the fun, making for one of the most memorable experiences since the world went a bit weird back in 2020.
As part of his trip over to the UK, Zion embarked on a couple of intensive video game hunts with the help of fellow Nintendo Life video producer Felix and ex-Nintendo Life alumni (now Good Vibes Gaming video host) Jon Cartwright. The hunts highlighted some key regional differences between EU and NA, including the general price of games, the existence of regional specific games (Cheggers Party Quiz, anyone?), and how items such as Wii Points were distributed.

One bit of criticism I have for Evo 2022 is just how late it's allowing these tournaments to go. Day 2 went on for so long that it technically ended on Day 3. With another post-midnight finish in the works for the final day of the show, the folks at Arc System Works gave everyone a break by bringing their big announcement for Guilty Gear Strive to the Evo stage before the Top 8 tournament started. And what an announcement it was. Not only is Bridget coming to the game as part of Guilty Gear Strive's second season of DLC, but Bridget will be playable starting tomorrow, August 8.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlf83j7WD8
Armed with a yo-yo and mechanized teddy, Bridget debuted in Guilty Gear X2 and has been a fan favorite ever since. A poll conducted by Arc System Works in 2013 named Bridget the most popular character in the franchise. So it was only a matter of time before Bridget was added to Strive.
With the reveal of Bridget, Arc System Works also reminded fans of its roadmap for the second season of DLC. A second fighter is scheduled to release this year as part of the season pass with the third and fourth characters hitting in 2023 alongside two new battle stages. New fighters are always great, but I love when developers make sure to include new arenas as part of DLC season passes.
In addition to the big Bridget news, it was also revealed that Guilty Gear Strive has sold one million copies.

As the curtain fell on Evo 2022's final Street Fighter V: Champion Edition tournament, Capcom took the opportunity to reveal brand new trailers for two of the World Warriors coming to next year's Street Fighter 6. Give it up for funky fly newcomer Kimberly and, the Korean razor blade herself, Juri Han!
Juri, who made her debut in Super Street Fighter IV, was pretty much a shoo-in for the new title, having frequently posted highly as one of the Street Fighter fan community's most popular characters. And it seems, in a post-S.I.N. and Shadaloo society, that Juri's days of assassination and corporate espionage are behind her, replaced with days of looking dope as fuck while searching the world for further blood-pumping thrills.

My love of gaming came a little bit later in life than most, so there are a ton of well-loved games that I need to catch up on, whether they're old classics or recently-released bangers.

For the most part, it's been really great to have so many games to play that knock it out of the park — playing the all-time greats all in a row has me reeling over how awesome this medium is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old, but gold?
Back in the early 2000’s, the Dark Alliance subseries of the Baldur’s Gate franchise was created as a means of bringing the Baldur’s Gate experience to console players. Either due to hardware limitations or a simple lack of audience interest at the time, the computer RPG design of traditional Baldur’s Gate wouldn’t work for a console game, so Snowblind decided to go with an action RPG for Dark Alliance. It turned out to be the right decision as audiences loved it, so a sequel was soon greenlit to keep the momentum going. Now that it’s gotten a re-release on modern platforms, how does it compare? Well, Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is a better game than its predecessor, yes; unfortunately, time hasn’t been too kind to this release.
The plot of Dark Alliance 2 is about as basic as it gets, centering around a villainous vampire who kidnaps the heroes of the first Dark Alliance and terrorizes the region around the city of Baldur’s Gate. You take on the role of a new hero who comes to the city in search of fame and fortune, but your hero eventually gets caught up in the effort to fight back against the vampire and bring peace to the surrounding region.

Vampire Survivors contains truly wacky secrets, some of which I'd never find without the community's guiding hand. Even though it's fun to catch up to the latest patches, I'll admit, certain hidden characters have remained elusive to the point where I've kind of lost hope. Now, with a new unlockable called The Forbidden Scrolls of Morbane, it's possible to input cheat codes to open up a bunch of stuff, including the trickiest secret characters.
That's right — it's Morbane time.
**Spoilers below**
With Vampire Survivors patch 0.10, The Forbidden Scrolls of Morbane relic was added to The Bone Zone, and to stand a chance of finding it, you'll want the Milky Way Map.

Activision Blizzard has been a monolith in the gaming industry for nearly fifteen years, best known for titles that have dominated the markets like World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. While its PC games have provided some of the greatest successes over the years, both critically and commercially, the company's latest financial report lets on that the tides might be turning in a significant way for the company. During the second quarter of 2022, Activision Blizzard made more than half of its total revenue from mobile games, which is more than PC and consoles combined (thanks, PC Gamer).

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/samurai-shodown-rollback-netcode-update-online-snk-evo-2022/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=samurai-shodown-rollback-netcode-update-online-snk-evo-2022"/>
        <updated>2022-08-06T18:00:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resharpen your blade...
SNK's 2019 release Samurai Shodown is a sharp-ass game — in both literal and metaphorical ways. The cult fighter successfully managed to reinvent itself for modern platforms, while retaining the very deliberate, intense, and high-damage combat style of the Neo Geo classics. Packed with interesting characters and powered by an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master play style, Samurai Shodown is a unique fighter that deserves to sit within the current zeitgeist.
And it looks like the cult title is getting the opportunity to take a second swing for the gold, as developer SNK has announced that it has teamed with studio Code Mystics for a new update that will implement brand new rollback netcode for the PlayStation, Xbox and PC editions of the period piece scrapper. While SamSho is a fine title from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint, unfortunately, the online element leaves a lot to be desired. While, in 2022, you can still find people fighting the good fight, lag-free action is harder to come by — which is a no go in such a precise, high-damage fighter.

And so, for the dedicated Samurai Shodown community — and fighting game fans in general — the rollback netcode update will be a very welcome addition, along with a sign that SNK has not abandoned the title in favor of some of its more modern releases. In fact, it is believed that the new update should bring online fluidity in alignment with The King of Fighters XV, which has very solid online stability once its fights are underway.
No specific release date was announced for the new update outside of the general window of spring 2023. Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia. Once again, the netcode update is only coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox editions of the game.
Evo 2023 is currently underway. You can check out the full schedule right here.

A real piece of gaming royalty joined the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster presented us with one of Bandai Namco's most iconic and seminal releases of gaming's golden era: Dig Dug, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Developed in 1981 and released to the burgeoning arcade market in 1982, Dig Dug is one of the most recognizable, memorable, and most successful releases of gaming's formative era. Players guide an intrepid miner through a series of single-screen underground caverns, digging out tunnels and battling the monsters that dwell within. In a mechanic that just seems so blackly comedic to modern eyes, our hero defeats his opposition by injecting them with a gas line, then inflating their sorry bodies until they literally explode!

If you've been on pins and needles waiting to find out who would be the final character of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass, you can unclinch and rejoice. During the opening night of Evo 2022, a teaser trailer dropped revealing that Marie will become a playable character. Launching in 2023 for both Skullgirls 2nd Encore and Skullgirls Mobile, Marie's arrival on the character select screen comes more than 10 years after Skullgirls first launched on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. She follows Annie of the Stars, Umbrella, and Black Dahlia in joining the cast, the latter of whom is still in alpha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCcAlwQb8Vo&t=3s
There is not a whole lot to take from that teaser, but I'm sure the news is more than enough for those Skullgirls fans who have stuck with the game over the last 10 years. As a casual fighter fan, I have to commend Future Club, Autumn Games, and Hidden Variable for keeping this game and its community going as long as it has. Other developers would have already thrown in the towel and moved on to a sequel.
As for the Skullgirls tournament at Evo 2022, congratulations to SonicFox for bringing home the victory in the Grand Finals against Dekillsage.
Skullgirls 2nd Encore is now available for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. It is scheduled to launch for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S later in 2022. The Season 1 Pass is now available for PC and PlayStation 4. It is expected to release on Nintendo Switch before the end of the year.

Welcome back! I have a brief break from last week's heat wave and I'm glad to not feel so on fire all the time. Have you heard of The Mortuary Assistant? I learned about it the other day and scooped it up for us to stream. Guys, this one looks seriously creepy.
Not sure I've played anything this caliber of icky on stream, so buckle in. It also looks like there's some classic scary game elements to it, but I don't wanna spoil — it's not ALL an icky simulator, is what I'm saying. I think I'm looking forward to it!

Hopefully it isn't too much for our stomachs. See you tonight!

A pair of Nintendo controllers could be joining the list of Steam-supported input devices. In a new Steam client beta, Valve has added support for Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.
The dual-unit controllers are, of course, primarily for the Nintendo Switch. But just in case you've been wanting to use them on your PC, some additional support is currently in the Steam beta.
Valve's support allows for the Joy-Cons to be used individually, as mini-gamepads. Or they can be combined into a paired, singular controller. Essentially, the same controller configurations you might mess around with on your Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WniaKJzCNRI
If other Nintendo controllers are more your speed, the Steam client beta also has improved support for Nintendo Online classic controllers. That includes the Nintendo 64, NES, SNES, and Genesis controllers. Support for those classics rolled out last week, but it looks like Valve is improving on the support that's already available.
Joyous controller options
It might seem a bit strange of an update, at first. I mean, I have tried to connect Joy-Cons to a PC before, with extremely mixed results. But official support isn't just nice for those who don't want to pick up extra controllers.
Joy-Cons are a pretty unique style of controller, with built-in sensors and everything. I'd only be speculating, but I'm interested to see what modders and other controller tinkerers can do with this.
And more controller support is never a bad thing. I'm almost tempted to try connecting these to a Steam Deck, if only to enable the bizarre dream of using Switch Joy-Cons on a portable PC.
Whether you're just looking for some extra Rocket League controllers or concocting bizarre scenarios, it seems neat. If you want to try it out, you can simply opt into the Steam client beta and test out Joy-Con support for yourself.

Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.
Then in 2020, something changed. With many of my normal social activities put on hold, I found myself with more free time at home tha…]]></summary>

Desktop Dungeons, the beloved turn-based roguelike, is coming back with a new style. And while it can be tricky going from a quaint pixel art presentation to a more general modern 3D style (albeit with nice new illustrated character art), the main draw was — and should still be — the puzzle-solving gameplay. Developer QCF Design announced the 3D remake Desktop Dungeons: Rewind for Steam with an estimated Q4 2022 release.

According to the team, "the goal with Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is to bring a game we love to modern devices and modern audiences.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/05/saturnalia-is-a-survival-horror-indie-with-an-art-style-you-have-to-see"/>
        <updated>2022-08-05T18:41:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.]]></summary>

My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It's a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don't think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It's a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

Discovery – then you know things have been bleak the past couple of days. 
The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery's streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

        <updated>2022-08-05T12:40:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

        <updated>2022-08-05T12:12:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: 
Get ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

August 4, 2022
Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today's news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We've enjoyed Ooblets whenever we've checked in on it over the years, so it's exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007's The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there's a reveal trailer below.

As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as "The Laughing Deer Show". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as "barely contained". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really "do" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we'd like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question "what games would you play for the first time again?" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.]]></summary>

Of course, this time you're not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you're in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you're able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that's uniquely yours.

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way. 
But the genre’s bubble gum aesthetics often mask a darker side – one prioritizing profit over peopl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg's game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn't be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef
August 4, 2022
Mochizuki's tweet reads, "There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei's own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said."
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has revealed Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the classic Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and it’s releasing in just over three months. 
More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.” 
While waiting for Tactics Ogre: Reborn to hit PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC this November, read our thoughts on the original in the Game Informer Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together review. Check out this Game Informer Replay segment on Tactics Ogre after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crossover brawler of our dreams, MultiVersus, is the fighting genre's latest prize winner. From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games' debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that's left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ's first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick & Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you'll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James' butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, "I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I've come away impressed with what I've played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year's Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you'd rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.]]></summary>

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout 2022's Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII's Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.]]></summary>

AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE's series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we'll see more gameplay at next week's THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million
Pokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million
Super Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million
Super Mario Party: 18.06 million
Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million
Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million
Ring Fit Adventure: 14.54 million
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well. Nintendo Switch Sports sold 4.84 million units, Mario Strikers: Battle League sold 1.91 million, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold 1.88 million units, making it the second-best selling Kirby game of all-time.

After that, feast your eyes upon all the new Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet revealed in today's Pokemon Presents showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon's cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year.

After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW's in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts.

More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch's sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

​NBA 2K is still in a rebuilding phase. While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.
We still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word "authenticity" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:
Easier Play
More Pro for the Pro Stick
Hang on the Rim
Shooting is a Weapon
Killing Stalls with Adrenaline 
Defensive Play
Improved A.I.
Badges Sound More Confusing But Better?

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can't be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023's sports management game Roller Drama.

While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

        <updated>2022-08-02T12:11:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Herschel "Guy" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a "AAA game studio" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. 
Here's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp

One more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.
@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx
July 30, 2022
As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, "I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. 
What do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are 'sigpatches', why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year 2020 was a big year for the Cyberpunk genre in video games because the hotly-anticipated (and long-in-development) Cyberpunk 2077 was finally released that year. However, it wasn't the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. 
I played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I'm glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR's latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all. CDPR choosing not to give reviewers codes for tho…]]></summary>

I can't keep pace with professionals so it's fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

This news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney. Running nearly two and a half minutes long, this trailer sets up the beginning of a rebellion led by Andor and others such as Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma (all played by the actors that portrayed them in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). You can check it out for yourself below: 


Elsewhere, Disney also released a fancy new illustrated poster for Andor today:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. 
One of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. 
“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” 
If you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. 
You’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).
In the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review.

That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren't happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don't like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA's official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don't think so, you can call into Madden NFL's ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA's snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA's involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...
@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ

89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!
#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE

Yo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!
#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X
July 28, 2022
The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year's ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player's rating? We'll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I'd call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

It's a fantasy turn-based strategy game designed by original Fire Emblem creator Shouzou Kaga with a team of volunteers, and it was released on Steam today with a full English translation.

In preparation, a Florida federal court has set some rules for what can and what can't be brought up before the jury. Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can't freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

It was previously aiming to release in September, but in an update on Twitter the developers say Darktide will now launch on November 30th. 

The upside is that they're going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

What isn't a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That's my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of 'nice' list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week's edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of 'best nice bloke-ness', Nate and Matthew have framed this week's episode as the four people they'd most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.
