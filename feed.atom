        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Warzone Season 3 update added a Champions Quest contract to Rebirth Island. The contract works similarly to how it does on Urzikstan, but there are a few significant differences that need explaining. Here is everything you need to know about getting a nuke in a Resurgence match. 


How to get a nuke on Rebirth Island in Warzone






Win five consecutive matches in Resurgence or standard battle royale


Pick up the Champions Quest contract, which is marked by a parachute with a star in the middle


Acquire all four elements


Construct the bomb


Defend the bombsite until it goes off



After picking up the Champions Quest contract, squads have 10 minutes to collect all three elements. Each element drops after an 11-minute timer, but kills, contracts, buy station purchases, and chests reduce the time. The fastest way to reduce the timer is to purchase items at a buy station. Players can also use the unidentified phone item which is located in the Headquarters POI vault after using the Biometric Scanner 27 days in a row. The phone gives you $500 to $1000 every 30 seconds, which also lowers the nuke timer by up to 11 seconds every 30 seconds. 


After collecting all three elements, the bomb drops from the sky, and the squad must insert all of the elements. After that, the nuke gets armed, and a two-minute detonation timer starts. If players complete the detonation process without an enemy defusing the bomb, the match ends, and the squad successfully completes the Resurgence Champions Quest.


Resurgence Champions Quest rewards





Here are all of the rewards for completing the Resurgence Champions Quest contract.



Engine Light’s On Weapon Camo


Material Handler Unique Operator Skin


Champion Banner Animated Calling Card 


Master Procrastinator Weapon Charm


Alpha Particles Weapon Sticker

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After emerging as one of Warzone's best close-range meta weapons, Raven Software nerfed the DG-58 LSW. In its absence, the MCW JAK Raven Kit checks off every box for what you want from a replacement. 


The Season 3 Reloaded update buffed and nerfed several weapons that needed to be slightly tweaked. However, the devs surprisingly didn't touch the DG-58 LSW. According to data provided by TrueGameData, the DG-58 LSW JAK Nightshade Kit had a significantly faster time-to-kill speed than all close-range meta weapons for gunfights between 0 and 20 meters. 


Image via Activision 


Raven Software didn't let that discrepancy slide for too long. The JAK Nightshade's damage values, max damage range, and headshot multiplier were nerfed into the ground. As a result, players needed to find a new weapon to use in short-range engagements. The WSP-9 leads all weapons by a wide margin with a 30 percent pick rate, according to WZ Ranked, but the second most popular weapon is what grabs our attention. 


TrueGameData crunched the numbers and determined that the nerf should knock the DG-58 LSW out of contention because of a smaller magazine size, damage per mag, and poor mobility. The MCW Jak Raven Kit boasts impressive ADS speeds, accuracy, and similar damage, making it a compelling choice. Check out our MCW loadout guide to know which attachments to use for this weapon.

This task is similar to a previous Handsake task titled Restoring Order. Here is how to complete the Shooting Gallery task for Handshake in Gray Zone Warfare and where you need to go to find the correct enemies.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where to eliminate hostiles at Hunter's Paradise


You can complete the Shooting Gallery task for Handshake by heading north to Hunter's Paradise and killing any 20 hostile enemies in the area. Once you've got the Shooting Gallery task, take a chopper to the northernmost Foxtrot 1 LZ near Hunter's Paradise. When the chopper lands, head west and you will start encountering enemies scattered throughout all of Hunter's Paradise. The screenshot above shows the location in which you can find the hostiles you need to eliminate for the Shooting Gallery task.


All of the hostile enemies that you kill in and around the Motel, Shooting Lanes, and Dumping Grounds of Hunter's Paradise count for this task, as well as those in the little shacks around the area in the woods. These enemies are a bit tougher than those in the starter towns, and you'll also have to contend with other players as this is a frequent PvP zone.


How to complete Shooting Gallery task


It may take more than a single sweep, but eventually, you will eliminate 20 hostiles in Hunter's Paradise which will complete the Shooting Gallery task. Head back to the Foxtrot 1 LZ and take a chopper back to base camp. Once you arrive in base camp hit the Tab key to open your UI and click on the Vendors tab and talk to Handshake. Click the yellow Complete button in the bottom right corner and the Shooting Gallery task will complete.


Handshake will give you the following rewards for completing Shooting Gallery:



1x M4A1 with attachments


$3,900


1,000 Experience


150 Reputation with Handshake

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's late game is centered around acquiring everything you can to increase your Mastery, and Prime items make up the bulk of that Mastery. To snag Prime items, you need to get their parts from Void Relics, meaning it's this endless cycle of acquiring Void Relics, leveling them up using Void Traces, then hoping to god it's the reward you want. Farming those Void Relics as quickly as possible helps move this process along. Here's where to farm Axi Relics in Warframe.


Where to get Axi Relics in Warframe


When it comes to farming Axi Relics in Warframe, three places are good depending on your situation. These locations are Tyana Pass on Mars, Hydron on Sedna, and Circulus on Lua. The first two are dependent on a few conditions, where Circulus is the most consistent. All three locations require you to reach the Rotation C reward to get a chance at an Axi Relic. This means you need to survive until the fourth major loot drop.


As for the first two options, Tyana Pass is good if you have yet to get Citrine or any assorted items you can get while farming the Mirror Defense mission. People tend to run this for a while, but it can be a little tedious after a while collecting all the Belric and Rania Crystals. Meanwhile, Hydron on Sedna is good if you have some items you've been wanting to level up for a while now. You need to reach 20 waves to get a chance at an Axi Relic so I wouldn't bring fully unleveled gear, but one or two items should be fine.


Otherwise, people heavily farm Circulus thanks to getting a ton of Lua Thrax Plasm and the ability to get Voruna. This means most random groups should end up farming the full 20 minutes needed. However, it's also the hardest of the three due to having the highest base enemy level of all three missions. Be sure to proceed with caution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 3 Reloaded brought back the iconic Akimbo Model 1887s, and years later, the shotguns pack the same hefty punch. 


After the mid-season update, Modern Warfare 3 got a new short-range meta contender. The JAK Wardens Conversion Kit transforms the Lockwood MK2 into Akimbo shotguns. Players must complete the Week 5 challenges to unlock this unique attachment and reach the maximum level on the Lockwood MK2. With the Conversion Kit equipped, the battle rifle would have the best sprint speed among MW3 shotguns, and a sprint to fire time of 35 milliseconds. TheXclusiveAce tested every MW3 shotgun and the average speed was 224 miliseconds. 


In addition, shotguns have a one-shot kill range of 29 meters when both weapons are fired simultaneously. Players should be able to effortlessly take down enemies relatively far away, making this weapon one of the best options in Season 3 Reloaded. Let's jump right into which attachments work best. 


Best Lockwood MK2 loadout in MW3

Muzzle: Crown Breaker Choke


Laser: Verdant Hook Cylindrical laser 


Conversion Kit: JAK Wardens 



Our loadout focuses on getting the tightest possible hipfire spread because you aren't able to aim down sights while using Akimbo weapons. The Crown Breaker Choke improves hipfire spread min by 100 percent and tactical stance spread by a good chunk at the small cost of recoil and ADS speed. Meanwhile, the Verdant Hook Cylindrical Laser helps sprint to fire speed, close-quarter accuracy while sliding, and hipfire and tac spread. You don't have too many options as the conversion kit restricts players from equipping a barrel, underbarrel, guard, comb, stock, or lever. 


If you are a fan of shotguns, there are no better options than the JAK Wardens. 29 meters is an exceptional one-shot kill range, and players will have no problems with this weapon's accuracy.

How to get Dracroot in Warframe


First, it should be noted that Dracroot can only be farmed in Duviri-related content. So, you can either find it out during the open-world aspects of the mode or through the Duviri Circuit.


In the first instance, you can look for Dracroots out in Duviri. They’re found in the lower half of the map during all Mood Spirals. They appear as red plants that curl at the top. They also have thorns around them akin to cacti.


You can find bushes of this plant at or near the following named areas of Duviri:

Fortunately, Raven Software started an investigation into the matter, but there will be a bit of a wait until the tact-sprint reload glitch sees a fix. 


As previously mentioned, Season 3 Reloaded unintentionally broke reloading. As a temporary solution, players can disable automatic sprinting. However, this workaround comes with a catch because getting used to playing without sprinting automatically will take some time to learn. In saying that, this alternative is still much more appealing than being unable to reload. Raven Software wouldn't go far to provide an exact date, but it did share promising news.

In the May 3 update the Warzone devs attempted to reassure a growingly frustrated player base. "Our team is diligently working on implementing a solution, which we’re anticipating to release sometime next week. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this process," Raven Software said. 


Then, on May 6, a data mine revealed that a new CoD update had been added to the database. This would indicate that we are finally getting closer to the fix going live. Players have already had to endure a few days with this glitch still around, but it's reassuring to know that the wait is almost over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if you’re not yet playing Hades 2 via Early Access, you can get in on the experience by way of your earholes. Supergiant Games has uploaded the entire soundtrack to YouTube so you can get a listen.


I’ve been playing Hades 2 for the past week or so. I’m not sure how much I should give away, but suffice it to say, there’s a song in there that you experience on every run. It’s called “Coral Crown” and it is quite the earworm. Uncomfortably so, since after I heard that the soundtrack was available, my first response was, “Oh no,” because now I wouldn’t have to play through a run just to get to the spot where the song plays.


I’m listening to it now. I’ll probably be listening to it a few times more throughout the day. And then I can guarantee you that it will be echoing around in there for a few days. I already had it stuck in my head, but now it’s going to be louder and I’ll know the lyrics.


The soundtrack is composed by Supergiants’ in-house musician, Darren Korb, and it’s another banger. It’s broadly atmospheric and varied. More importantly, it’s extremely listenable outside the context of the game itself. I recommend giving it a try.


Hades 2 is available now on PC via Early Access. The soundtrack can now be streamed from YouTube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, the reign of the HRM-9 as the Warzone meta SMG is over. It's been a while since we had the opportunity to use just about anything else. Now, there are a few options, though most prefer the Striker-9, the  WSP-9 is also viable. It's got mobility, close-range damage, and is shockingly accurate. The recent buffs it received made it one of the best options. 


The WSP-9 received a buff in Call of Duty Warzone


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone recently underwent their midseason 'Reloaded' update for Season 3. With it came a large number of changes to guns, including nerfing the Warzone meta weapons for the last few months. However, the underrated and underutilized WSP-9 also received a small buff, and it's one of the best close-range options in battle royale and Resurgence game modes.


According to the developer patch notes, the WSP-9's sprint-to-fire time was decreased from 110 ms to 66 ms, a 44% decrease. In other words, you'll be able to pull it up and shoot more quickly than before while on the move. That's exactly what you need in a versatile SMG.


How to build the best WSP-9 loadout for Warzone


Screenshot from Destructoid


As for the loadout, it isn't anything out of the ordinary for the WSP-9. Many builds require similar attachments, but the WSP-9 really doesn't need any help with recoil control. Instead, most of these items focus on mobility and damage output, making it excellent in nearly all situations.



ZEHMN35 Compensator Muzzle


HISS Short Light Barrel


DR-6 Handstop Underbarrel


50 Round Magazine


JAK Glassless Optic or optic of your choosing



If you're not a fan of the Striker meta, or just want another SMG option in your arsenal, this WSP-9 loadout is the perfect option. Flying around Rebirth Island with this lightweight mobility gun is always fun for you slide-cancel fiends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Hades game sparked a thunderous surge of excitement in the gaming community, thanks to its gripping storyline and dynamic gameplay. Since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting a sequel, and now, that moment has finally arrived with its Early Access. But, you might be wondering: Is it necessary to play Hades 1 before diving into Hades 2? Here's what you need to know.


Can you play Hades 2 without playing Hades 1?


According to the Hades 2 FAQ page, playing Hades 1 before 2 is not a prerequisite, as it offers a relatively stand-alone storyline. However, it does maintain a connection to its predecessor, unfolding the events that follow the original. In Hades 2, you won't be stepping into the shoes of the previous protagonist Zagreus, but instead, you'll be immersed in the life of his sister Melinoë.

While Hades 2 can be enjoyed as a stand-alone experience, veteran players can anticipate nostalgic callbacks from the original. But that's not all. New mechanics and challenges are also in store, promising to shake up the series' classic rogue-lite elements and keep you on your toes. Also, the story of Hades 2 incorporates characters that you get to meet and grow close to in Hades 1, adding a bit of a sentimental attachment to spur on more runs.


Even if it's not a strict requirement, I still highly recommend playing the first Hades game. It's a fantastic way to grasp the gameplay and the rich narrative, heavily inspired by Greek mythology. This way, you can truly understand the buzz around the game and fully immerse yourself in the complete story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Arcana in Hades 2 is one of the game’s systems of permanent progression. It’s pretty straightforward most of the time – you use Grasp to hold an unlocked card. However, some defy the expectation, and one of them is card XIII, The Centaur.


The Centaur is a bit frustrating because it’s a very useful card. Every five levels you gain 3 HP and 3 MP. It’s not massively significant but it’s passive and useful. There’s no reason not to take advantage of it.


Which cards activate XIII the Centaur Arcana in Hades 2, explained


However, The Centaur says it requires 0 Grasp, but that doesn’t mean you can just activate it for free. Cards that require 0 Grasp have another method for activation that is described when you hover over it. For the Centaur it says:


“Activate Cards that use 1 (Grasp) through 5 (Grasp).”


Maybe you immediately understood what it meant, but I was stumped. A lot of cards cost between 1-5 Grasp, does that mean I need to activate all of them?


No, what it means is that you need to activate a card for each Grasp cost. This means you need to have an active card worth 1 Grasp, another worth 2 Grasp, then 3 Grasp, 4 Grasp, and 5 Grasp. You need at least one of each. Once you have them active, The Centaur will activate on its own with nothing else required.


This means that you need to have at least 15 Grasp to slot one of each of these cards. Thankfully, The Centaur doesn’t cost more than that, but it does slightly restrict what cards you want to carry in your hand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Final Fantasy XIV maintenance scheduled to begin today, many players are trying to cram in some last-minute weekly tasks before servers go offline for their usual short window. However, thanks to a DDoS attack, players in every Data Center region are facing major issues and disruptions. 


DDoS attacks happen to all MMOs from time to time, and Final Fantasy XIV is certainly no stranger to them. The last one happened on April 12, with others hitting the online Final Fantasy in March and December. Thankfully, they're usually remedied within hours, but today's seems particularly pesky. Long-time players may notice there's an uptick in complaints across Twitter, Reddit, and your usual Discord stomping grounds. 




It's not just North America, either. A quick glance over Twitter conversations shows players across Japan, Europe, and Oceania Data Centers hit with frequent outages, too. The official Lodestone post addressing the issue acknowledges as much, with players across social media reporting the same sorts of disconnects multiple times in short periods, or even being unable to log in at all.


In our own experience on the Primal Data Center, associate editor Andrea Shearon can't seem to stay connected for more than five to 15 minutes at a time, and noted the problem around 9 a.m. CST. The team at Square Enix is currently investigating the issue, as well as taking necessary countermeasures to try and get FFXIV back to its usual, stable state.

While there is little information to go off of currently, past attacks have us hopeful the nuisance won't be a problem for very long. FFXIV Maintenance begins later — May 7 at 3 a.m. PDT — so hopefully, you can get your seasonal event chores finished up while juggling the outages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sampling Hades 2’s early access build on the Steam Deck, and my only complaint – besides the smooching frog having eluded me for hours – is that it’s giving me very little to write about, performance analysis-wise. Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.
Hades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!
This second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.
See Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:

Ah, Super Monkey Ball... Since its debut back in 2001, Sega's platforming, puzzle-solving, party extravaganza has had its ups and downs over the years, but has nevertheless remained a firm favourite with gamers - particularly those with a certain proclivity for Nintendo consoles.
In fact, Super Monkey Ball has shown up on pretty much every Nintendo platform bar the Wii U (pause for tiny violin) since its inception, making it almost as synonymous with The Big N as franchises like Animal Crossing, Mario Party, and — bizarre as it may be — Sonic the Hedgehog.

As a boss battle in Hades 2 they are a deadly trio that has bested me more times in the last few hours than I care to admit. But as a sign of things to come for this early access roguelike sequel, they are an encouraging bunch of characterful malcontents. The harbingers of a confident, slash-happy action game, and another poppy adaptation of classic Greek japes.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future. It also features an in-depth breakdown of Hades II's new features and our impressions …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-06T12:51:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. 
This follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. 
Thank you for your feedback.
May 3, 2024
If you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. 
Ghost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You will not survive.
Wrath: Aeon of Ruin has been a long time coming. Running on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine and developed by some of the Quake scene’s most skilled modders, Wrath looked set to take over the retro shooter world when it hit Early Access in 2019. Then it was hit with delay after delay, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2022 release date slipped to 2023, then 2024.
And now, finally, Wrath is here. And upon playing it, we understand why it took developer KillPixel so long to finish it, for both better and worse. What’s here is good, but Wrath often feels like it’s struggling under the weight of its own ambition and the limitations of being on a console - and no, we're not just talking about the Switch.

PlayStation will not be requiring Helldivers 2 players to link their Steam accounts to PlayStation Network accounts following widespread backlash from the game's community.

Of all the studios to potentially work on a Donkey Kong project, Vicarious Visions (now known simply as Blizzard Albany) admittedly wasn't particularly high up on our list.
However, details have emerged of a now-cancelled DK project at the studio via a new video from Did You Know Gaming (with prior reporting from DK Vine). According to the research, leadership at Vicarious Visions had wanted to collaborate more closely with Nintendo after the studio's work on Skylanders: Superchargers (which, if you remember, included the likes of Bowser and Donkey Kong on Wii U, Wii, and 3DS). It had received developer kits for the Nintendo Switch and wanted to create something truly unique for the upcoming system.

However, it was its sequel, 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back, that demonstrated that not only was creator George Lucas’ magnum opus more than a one-off fluke, but he had established a universe ripe for expansion. Read more...]]></summary>

Square Enix has a plethora of RPG series under its belt, but of all of them, SaGa is certainly its most experimental, unique, and the hardest to crack into.

While earlier games have you selecting characters and classes as blank-slates, later entries had a set cast with their own individual storylines.

The release of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker back in 2019 may have 'ended' Star Wars as we'd known it for the previous four-and-a-bit decades, but all it really did was tie a bow on the cinematic tales of the Skywalker clan and the nine-film saga which began in 1977.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. 
If you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same. But if you're new to this team, or just want to check if you're ready for the game later this month, we've got you covered. 


Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements
Below is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum. And as you can see, it's a game that requires a lot of power (click the image to enlarge). 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. 
For more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch. After that, watch this Hellblade II gameplay trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't have a Game Boy Camera as a lad, partly because I couldn't afford one, and partly because my "friends" used to troll me ("bullying", I think we called it back then) about my Game Boy. Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

Out sometime in May, it's the work of James Beech, who describes himself as "an on-again, off-again AAA veteran" with credits on Metroid Prime 4, Remnant: From the Ashes, and Crysis 3. The environments take hefty influence from Carceri d'invenzione, a series of prints created in the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose name has become a byword for impossible spaces.

But others did, sometimes complaining about the art style, which was a chunky and plastic-looking departure from previous games in the series. It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity.

Reader, I do think it's quite atmospheric, but I do not think it's all that unsettling. If anything, I find it a bit dull, in a way that's semi-frustrating.

Games like Helldivers 2, Palworld, Lethal Company, and Sons of the Forest are all major standouts for this…

It's this which most interests me about The Forever Winter, which takes place in a "PvEvE conflict" in which enemy factions - including enormous, stomping robots - are constantly fighting one another while you and your squad try to scavenge and survive in their shadow. Its first trailer showing in-game footage is below.

This is the day the XDefiant preseason will take begin, giving players a chance to enjoy the shooter before its official first season begins. This release date reveal follows various betas and tests for the game, which at one point, resulted in the game getting indefinitely delayed last year.

I'm so far unconvinced by the need to pay real money to unlock a premium warbond, therefore. The trailer for the next premium warbond, coming May 9th, does contain glimpses of some weapons I'd like, however.

On the one hand, you've got to deal with interdimensional horrors of various flavours, such as multiple-storey cryptids and squishy skinless wolves; on the other, invading squads of Combiney soldiers. Fortunately, you've got a big fat Ivy League brain stuffed with knowledge of killer gadgets, base construction, subterranean farming and battlefield medicine. My increasing phobia for survival games notwithstanding, I think this looks and sounds like a hoot - and it's out now in early access. Here's the launch trailer.

Then you watch its trailers and find surrealist imagery, genre-hopping, and a bleak sense of humour are part of its arsenal, and suddenly it seems, to me, irresistible.

It's out now.

His demonic influence manifests into world-distorting gameplay sequences as Indika explores the rural wilds of early 20th-century Russia. Tack on bizarre pixel art flourishes and other overt video game elements, and we can't tell if Indika is taking itself seriously or not. But we do know that we want to keep playing it.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore an early section of this attention-grabbing adventure available now on PC (and PS5 and Xbox SeriesX/S later this month).

It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.
Founders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. 
The Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. 
It was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. 
Keoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. 
The video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: 


As you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. 
Like in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. 
Here's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: 

For more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park.

Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 2:47 p.m., May 2, 2024:
Earlier today, we learned that Take-Two Interactive, the company-publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, had closed Rollerdrome studio Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games. Both of those games, and many others including the recently released No Rest for the Wicked, were published by Private Division, an indie-publishing arm under Take-Two.
Now, in a new update from GamesIndustry.biz, the publication reports that Take-Two has shuttered the "vast majority" of Private Division's teams in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich, according to one of its sources. When GamesIndustry.biz reached out to Take-Two for confirmation, the company issued the same statement that can be read in Game Informer's original story below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medieval city builder Manor Lords was Steam's most-wishlisted game prior to release, and has now managed the feat of transmuting that anticipation into broad enthusiasm and very healthy sales. Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.
Styczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. 
On the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine.

I've never put in the many, many hours needed to earn the requisite gear nor partied up with the many, many people necessary to slay a big dragon. If only raiding was possible without these things… well, my saviour seems to have arrived in a form I wasn't expecting: 2D anime bunny girls. Rabbit And Steel is a co-op action roguelike that's raiding without the pre-grind and it looks rather wonderful.

That translates to 6€, $6 or £5 for all three main games and 40 DLC packs, plus bells and whistles such as 4K Ultra HD and beefed-up character models. If you haven't played a Mass Effect game before, this is a pretty good place to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your feelings on Funko Pop probably fall into one of two categories: you either hate the black-eyed, copy-paste figures modelled on pop-culture characters with a burning passion, or you own enough of them to construct a small fortress and defend your newfounded Funko nation from the government. Either way, it looks like the first video game starring the ubiquitous toy collectables might somehow scratch your itch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Batman: Arkham series redefined the superhero genre and changed the course of action games in the decade following Arkham Asylum's release. While four mainline entries – Asylum, City, Origins, and Knight – delivered similar gameplay, a smaller spin-off game, 2016's Batman: Arkham VR, let players step into the shoes of the Caped Crusader using their PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, or HTC Vive headset. Batman: Arkham VR felt more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out game, but its relatively high sales showed that the appetite was there. Today, Oculus Studios announced another VR title set in the Batman: Arkham universe titled Batman: Arkham Shadow.
Though Rocksteady Studios, the developer of Asylum, City, and Knight, was behind Batman: Arkham VR, the developer that most recently releas…]]></summary>

As part of that, they're reportedly now doing away with 70 positions at their Seattle offices - Seattle being the home of the Take-Two-owned Intercept Games, the current developers of space sim Kerbal Space Program 2.

And of course, it wouldn't be an Amazon sale if the most reliably discounted gaming mouse, the Logitech G502 Hero wasn't included in the sale. This time, the classic wired mouse can be yours for just £30:

I loved the first Sins and so did Kieron Gillen (RPS in peace) whose 16-year-old review dwells appreciatively on the spectacle of cruisers and frigates bouncing to hyperspace on the very edge of a solar system. We don't seem to have written about the second one - time to change that, I guess. Here's the Steam release announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week a Catholic media ministry (not sure what that is but okay) called Catholic Answers created a generative AI priest chatbot called Father Justin. Fr. Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.
Catholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a "me and my wife saw you across the bar" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.

Those lord packs are now the three top rated expansions in the series’ history, and the base game itself saw a huge uptick in positive reviews. The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76. None of this would be especially notable, however, if this wasn’t a complete turnaround from how things have been for the best part of a year now.

They're partly inspired by the recent Fallout TV show, which puts a jaded cowboy ghoul in a pivotal role and has led to an increase in players of the online multiplayer RPG. This production will likely be more faithful to the bard than to Amazon Prime. It will open with the line: "Now is the nuclear winter of our discontent."

Not only has it gifted us details on the new mission type and the new season event, it's also given us an idea of when we might see Season 6 emerge. I suppose you could liken the stream to a bushy Dwarven beard, from which the devs pluck out announcements like it's show and tell. And the show and tell is set in a dingy mine. And there are multiple pints involved.

Step forward Mini Settlers, which has a free prologue version you might try if you're weary of Manor Lording, or you've already exhausted the play possibilities of early access Franconia.

The CJEU's judgment leaves no stone unturned explaining why that isn't so, leaving case law to deal with the turbulence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zynga has released a new trailer for its upcoming competitive multiplayer game, Star Wars: Hunters, revealing a June 4 release date alongside a new cinematic look at some of the characters. Star Wars: Hunters will hit Switch and iOS and Android devices on that day, giving players the chance to compete with others in iconic locations like the forest moon of Endor, the icy planet of Hoth, and elsewhere while controlling Hunters like J-3DI, a droid who thinks he's a Jedi, Utooni which is two Jawas stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, and more. 
Zynga says each Hunter boasts their own unique set of abilities to aid them in the Arena, which is the marquee attraction of the new planet of Vespaara. "Star Wars: Hunters features a number of game modes for players to test their mettle, such as Squad Brawl, in which opposing teams will battle to rack up the most eliminations, and Trophy Chase, where competing teams will vie for control of the elusive droid TR-F33," a press release reads. 
Check out the action in the new Star Wars: Hunters trailer below: 


"We are beyond excited to welcome fans across the globe to Vespaara," Zynga vice president Sam Cooper writes in a press release. "We can't wait for gamers to meet our Hunters and hop into the Arena. There are so many fun twists and winks to recognizable, beloved Star Wars settings, creatures, and themes within our game that we also are eager to see players worldwide get the chance to discover." 
Star Wars: Hunters will be available worldwide on Switch, iOS, and Android devices. It will be free, and on Switch, it does not require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to download and play.

If you're a fan of a popular movie or TV show from any time in the last several decades, chances are, they've made a Funko Pop figurine of the main characters. The brand is ubiquitous in pop culture, so it was only a matter of time before it got a big video game adaptation. This sort of game could easily be a cheap cash grab, but after watching a preview demo and listening to one of the head developers speak about it, I'm confident that Funko Fusion is much more than that.
You've never played a game by developer 10:10 Games, but you probably know the work of its staff – the founders of the studio are some of the former architects of the Lego games developed…]]></summary>

Vengeance promises many new things: a revised battle system, a new story branch, new areas, and more. What I found when I played, was several punches to my metaphorical ribs. A few to my gut. Sure, I spent some time with the new stuff, but really, I spent most of my time being absolutely demolished in turn-based battles against various demons of a phallic and non-phallic nature. I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.

With Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, Atlus hopes to take the well-liked entry to even greater heights; not only is this new version of the well-liked RPG making the leap to additional platforms, but it's bringing with it new locations, new demons, various quality-of-life improvements, and an entirely brand new storyline.

        <updated>2024-04-30T14:05:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. 
This news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. 


"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources," the release reads. "As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024." 
While potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. 
This release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July.

I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.

        <updated>2024-04-30T14:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as "a cross between a game and a stop motion film", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.
I love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. 
"Another year, another cycle," a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. "The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair." 
Here's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: 
Returnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel
Returnal Artbook
Fallen Asteria Animated Adaptation
Now, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an "animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria." Check it out for yourself below: 


Housemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. 
It's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. 
Here's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: 
There's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. 
Returnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's first expansion, Shattered Space, is set to arrive this fall, according to director Todd Howard. Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. 
Howard revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. 


As noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. 
As for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: "For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more."
Other updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure.

I like this creature , but honestly, you could replace them with a sentient bin bag, and I’d be happy. With pixel art this vibrant and detailed, I reckon even a bulging sack of coffee ground and banana peels would be worth adventuring with. Don’t do it, though. It’s a good guinea pig.

But perhaps most importantly of all, Poncle say they'll answer the question that's been on everyone's lips: "Why is it called Santa Water?".

Does the suggestion that everything may be a lie also apply to the suggestion itself? Is this an unreliable Steam page? Perhaps the game is secretly a cheerful Playmobile platformer with plentiful ledge-assist, rather than a horrible point-and-clicker that starts you off in a dark cell with a bunch of obviously cursed artefacts, and gets steadily worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, remember Starfield? I do, just about, although any interest in it feels like a distant dream now. But not to Todd Howard! The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of "in the fall". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). 
Before that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) "a big update that's coming really soon", and that "we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff." This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year.

The second, a reseller in the astrology business, just had his case suddenly dismissed. Nobody could've predicted that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been five years since Game of Thrones ended and a good while since we had a decent video game based on George RR Martin’s fantasy writings that aren’t Elden Ring lore. Yet it seems that Game of Thrones’ cultural cachet still has enough draw to inspire new games of its own. And not just an arguably underrated-if-also-not-particularly-great action-adventure RPG or fairly okay Telltale adventure game, either, but a whole honest-to-goodness Game of Thrones MMO currently in development, according to new rumours.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were synonymous with gaming in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, largely thanks to their influence over arcade brawlers. Games like 1989’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also known as ’89 Arcade) and 1991’s Turtles in Time are time-honored classics that shaped the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre, and 2022’s Shredder’s Revenge demonstrated that the style is still viable in the modern landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jackbox Party Packs have always allowed for adult-themed responses, but it was never solicited or directly encouraged by the games themselves. For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.
We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.
However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.
Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!]]></summary>

According to the report, the Control 2 team is “focused on finalizing the proof-of-concept stage, in which the game world, game mechanics and visual targets are proven.” The project is expected to move into the production readiness stage in Q2 of this year. Control 2 was first announced in 2022.

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

In a post on X, the developer simply posted a graphic of what appears to be a fractured reflection of a woman’s eyes with the word “Tomorrow.”

Less than two hours later, Housemarque shared a brief video clip of the same image but in animated form.

While the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. 
Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.]]></summary>

This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

My life is a calendar where every square has "deals" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.
Still, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Given the opportunity, players will become a merciless egg baron and sit chuckling on a throne of shells while medieval Europe cowers beneath their imperious yolk,” is what I assume Soren Jonson once said, and it looks like Manor Lords is proving this timeless adage right once more. Despite shifting over a million units and hitting the highest concurrent player count of any ‘city builder’ on Steam, creator Greg ‘Slavic Magic’ Styczeń is already looking to the future of how the building game handles trade.

Let's see here, we've got a survival shooter that's essentially set in Black Mesa, a sardonical adventure about questing Russian Orthodox nuns, a game about running the company that starts the zombie apocalypse, and a cosy village grower with an atypical emphasis on disease and death. Lovely!

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.
Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

In the heyday of the tennis-sim video game genre, Top Spin and Virtua Tennis were the best players in the crowded space. However, in the time since the genre’s boom settled, the offerings have fallen off considerably, with both franchises going more than a decade without a new release. TopSpin 2K25 signals the reemergence of the critically acclaimed series, and though it’s been a while since it stepped on the court, it’s evident the franchise hasn’t lost its stroke.

        <updated>2024-04-26T17:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.]]></summary>

Kay's standing with these syndicates is primarily represented by the Reputation System, an ambitious mechanic that tracks her relationship with these criminal organizations.

        <updated>2024-04-25T15:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.
An update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!
https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv
April 25, 2024
For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.
Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.
There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.]]></summary>

Players will control a single vessel that channels various heroes known as the fallen. These are individual characters, each with unique skill sets, combat styles, and lore, that share the player-controlled vessel. As such, players ca…]]></summary>

Ahead of its release, but after spending some time with the game, we had a chance to reconnect with Shift Up CEO and Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim after speaking with him earlier this year. This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.

Another Crab's Treasure, as the name suggests, is a humorous and pun-filled world where the sea is your Soulslike oyster. A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector. What follows is an adventure that excels at being an amusing and bright repri…]]></summary>

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story.

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it's been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…]]></summary>

The June 2023 reveal of Star Wars Outlaws gave us our first glimpse of Kay Vess and Nix, the two protagonists of the game. From talking with Massive Entertainment during our recent trip out to Sweden to get our hands on Star Wars Outlaws, it sounds as though their bond will be special. However, they aren't on this journey alone, as they are joined by a trenchcoat-wearing BX-commando droid named ND-5. Though Kay and Nix were greater points of emphasis during our studio visit, we had to ask the developers about the internet-popular droid that joins the Star Wars Outlaws adventure.
