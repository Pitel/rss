Gran Turismo 7 launches on March 4, and driving sim enthusiasts are in a tizzy asking themselves one burning question: how would the game's beautifully rendered cars look if Kirby ate them? You haven't seen it, but they're definitely wondering about this.

Martha Is Dead starts extremely strong, introducing immediately a dynamic between twin sisters Martha and Giulia that sets the stage for the entire game.

Margit The Fell Omen is the first mandatory boss you’ll encounter in Elden Ring. You’ll find his fog gate inside the Castleward Tunnel, which begins at the top of Stormhill, the wind-swept lands northeast of the starting area called Limgrave. The hammer-wielding steward is old but quick on his feet and poses a more significant threat to slower melee-focused players, especially those of a lower level. If you’re still trying to figure out how to beat Margit The Fell Omen, we’ve got you covered. In this Elden Ring boss guide, we’ll show you how to find a unique item to make the fight much mo…]]></summary>

This week's episode of All Things Nintendo is all about celebrating the first five years of the Nintendo Switch. The anniversary is right around the corner, so Brian invites Game Informer online content director Ben Reeves back to talk about the biggest milestones of the Switch's first half-decade, as well as share some stories from the last five years covering the system.
Note: Brian is out on assignment this week, so this episode was recorded a week early. If any noteworthy news hit over the last week, All Things Nintendo will cover it next week.

Knockout City, the popular EA Originals dodgeball game developed by Velan Studios, is officially going free-to-play with the start of Year 2. 
This news comes by way of a new post by Velan on EA’s Knockout City page. In it, the studio reveals that following the conclusion of the current Season 5, Season 6 will kick off Year 2, which will in turn kick off the game’s transition into a free-to-play title.

Every adventure is a journey of some sort, but we are often so consumed with the destination we sometimes forget to enjoy the ride. Far: Changing Tides pushes you to soak in the small moments that can be overlooked in our rush to reach the peak. Okomotive newest side-scrolling platformer is a meditative odyssey full of trials and triumphs. But this pilgrimage is so powerful I was often content to forget about my end goal.

Valve’s Steam Deck launches today, meaning its first wave of customers will soon be gaming on a shiny (and very large) handheld PC and looking for things to play. The device can’t play every title and Steam recently rolled out new library categories to better label which of your games work on the Deck and which don’t. Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  
In a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition
Darksiders Genesis
Desperados III
This is the Police 2
The next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:
Battle Chasers: Nightwar
Biomutant
Darksiders: Warmastered Edition
Destroy All Humans! (2020)
Elex
Expeditions: Rome
MX vs ATV All Out
Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated
This is the Police
There are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the release of Majora's Mask on Switch, available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack N64 library.

The Zelda games have a lot of fans and there's also been plenty of opportunities over the years to revisit previous instalments in the series, and indeed The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask has seen a few re-releases since first appearing on the Nintendo 64 back in 2000. It was included on the GameCube's The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition compilation, then saw a Virtual Console release on the Wii and Wii U, and (most notably) appeared on the 3DS as a wonderful glasses-free-3D remaster that sanded off some of its rough edges and made it more approachable for modern gamers on a handheld system (re)experiencing Link's quest in the world of Termina.

The aim was to answer as many as possible in time for the system’s official launch, which is today! After scouring through your questions and posing them to hardware editor James - who's been putting the system through its paces for a week or so now - we've created a mammoth 19 minute long video that's bursting at the seams with new information about Valve's first handheld PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.
What, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.


While indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.

A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. 


Not that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.
Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.

The nature of that appeal is quite different depending on your perspective. Some primarily console-focused gamers may find a low-cost entry into at least part of the PC gaming experience. For more dedicated PC players, it provides a chance to take what may already be an extensive Steam library on the go – albeit with only specific titles optimized right now. Either way, the Steam Deck is an impressive first step into a promising future of portable PC play – with some significant issues holding it back from greatness.

Blood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.

Elden Ring is doing very well – its Steam numbers are already nearly six times greater than From Software’s previous all-time high – but some players have criticized the game’s performance, particularly on PC. 
From Software has released a new launch-day message specifically addressing the performance issues some are experiencing in Elden Ring and it seems some fixes could soon be on the way. The message addresses issues happening on console versions of the game and PC versions of it, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing the Steam Next Fest demo of The Wandering Village, a city-builder that has you rustle up a community on the back of a roaming beast. It's called Onbu and it couldn't give a monkey's that you're on its back just trying to get by. At first, that is. Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.
I'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu. My enemy isn't some army a mile away, it's Onbu.

There's something to be said about witnessing a historic moment firsthand.
From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki pioneered the Soulsborne genre, a smart subversion of conventional action RPG mechanics brimming with marvelous setpieces, writhing horrors, and certain death. After Demon's Souls' triumphant launch in 2009, From Software's rise to prominence was all but guaranteed … or so I've been told. You see, I don't doubt the reported brilliance of the studio's catalog; I've just never experienced it for myself. Until now, that is.

Before Ryza came onto the scene and changed up the Atelier game, many would agree that the previous darling of the series was Atelier Sophie. Evidently, Gust thought so too, as it decided to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series not with the inevitable conclusion of the Secret trilogy, but with a rather unexpected sequel starring Sophie. We’re glad it went with that choice, as Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream is a fantastic new entry blending open-ended design, charming aesthetics, and compelling crafting systems into one must-have package.
Those of you who didn’t play the first Atelier Sophie (which is available on Switch eShop in 'DX' form) need not worry about the story, as there’s a helpful recap you can watch if you want to get caught up on the broad strokes. Sophie 2 is set just after that game and before Atelier Firis, filling in some plot details that were previously left vague and creating more connections between those two titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harriers are rare among the bird family, in that they’re one of the very few birds to have been overtaken in popularity by their namesake fighter jet*. Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. 


So it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks.

Elden Ring is finally out after years of anticipation and it seems the hype that’s been building since its announcement in 2019 has paid off for From Software. 
That’s because less than 24 hours after release, Elden Ring’s Steam numbers (courtesy of SteamDB, which tracks the numbers of players in a game) are already nearly six times greater than From Software’s previous all-time high. That previous high resides with Dark Souls III, which has a peak playerbase of 129,975. Elden Ring’s current all-time high is a whopping 764,835, which is roughly 5.9 times higher than that of Dark Souls III…]]></summary>

My Nintendo has improved a lot in recent months with a number of tempting physical rewards being released. The latest to land are some rather cute Pokémon-themed cable holders, so if you're like this scribe and have a bad habit of leaving cables lying around in a mess, they're worth a look.

There once was a time when movies based on video games were box office poison, but that has changed in recent times thanks to the commercial success of films based on Resident Evil, Sonic and Pokémon.
The latest game to get the Hollywood treatment is Sony's Uncharted, which, despite some lukewarm reviews, has performed well enough in cinemas to trigger discussions about turning it into a full-blown movie franchise.

Monark is an intriguing arrival this week on Switch, an RPG published by NIS America with some key Shin Megami Tensei veterans in the development team. In our Monark review last week we gave it a recommendation, praising its combat system and concept while acknowledging the downside of rather basic visuals and repetition of enemies and environments.
With its EU / Australian release today (having arrived in North America earlier in the week) it now has a rather dramatic launch trailer to set the scene. You can check it out at the top of the page.

KEMCO is a prolific publisher, particularly when it comes to RPGs, and it has another due to release on 3rd March. This time around it's Ambition Record, developed by EXE-CREATE and heading to the eShop (as well as PSN) for $14.99USD, with a 10% discount on pre-orders.
Ambition Record originally came out on mobile back in 2019 before arriving on Xbox and PC earlier this month, so its shift to console has taken a little while. As you can see in the original trailer it has a decent look, giving us 3DS-era vibes albeit at a higher resolution. It's reviewed rather well on Google Play with plenty of players seeming to enjoy its story.

Russia has openly attacked and invaded Ukraine after weeks of mounting tensions between the two countries, with dozens of Ukrainian citizens reportedly killed by bombings. As the world watches this historical (and frankly, terrifying) event unfold, efforts have begun to help aid civilians caught in the crossfire. That includes 11Bit Studios, makers of the acclaimed 2014 anti-war survival game, This War of Mine. 
11Bit, a Polish studio, has announced it is heavily discounting This War of Mine, its expansion and console port The Little Ones, and its DLC across all platforms for the next week. The game is currently 75-8o% off, dropping it down to $4.99 on Steam and $3.99 on consoles. 100 percent of the profits made during this sale will form a fund that will be donated to the Ukrainian Red Cross. In This War of Mine, players oversee and care for a group of civilian survivors of a devastating conflict in a commentary of the horrors of war. You can read 11Bit’s full statement below. 
11 Bit isn’t the first European Studio to condemn the attacks. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 developer GSC Game World, which is based in Ukraine, posted its own call for support, saying in part:

Fortunately, thanks to a new Steam page, you can sign in to your account and quickly see what’s verified for Steam Deck, what’s playable, and what won’t work on it. It takes less than a minute and you’ll see four different categories for your Steam Library games: Deck Verified Games From Your Library, Deck Playable Games From Your Library, Unsupported Deck Games From Your Library, and Untested Deck Games From Your Library. 
Here’s what each means, according to Valve: 
Deck Verified: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are fully functional on Steam Deck, and work great with built-in controls and display.
Deck Playable: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are functional on Steam Deck, but might require extra effort to interact with or configure. 
Unsupported: Valve’s testing indicates these games in your Steam Library currently don’t function on Steam Deck. Valve is continuing to add support for more games over time. 
Untested: Valve’s testing team hasn’t yet gotten to the remaining games in your Steam library, but we’re testing new games every day. Come back often to see more of your library get Verified. 
You can sign in to your Steam account here to see which of your Steam Library games are Steam Deck verified and ready to play. After that, check out these images comparing the Steam Deck's size to the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Switch.

Cult of the Lamb is a delightfully demented-looking title by Massive Monster and Devolver Digital that became one of our most anticipated indie titles when it was first unveiled last August. The game lets you control a cute lamb and form a demonic cult. Fun! PC had been the only confirmed platform, but a new update has announced that Cult of the Lamb will spread its influence to consoles.
That would be PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, to be specific. Unfortunately, a release date remains elusive, but Cult of the Lamb is still targeting 2022.

In Cult of the Lamb, you play as a possessed lamb who must repay a debt to a mysterious stranger who saved their life. That repayment comes in the form of forming a cult dedicated to this stranger’s name. You’ll travel across the procedurally generated land spreading the good (?) word to seduce followers by preaching sermons, holding dark rituals, and gathering resources to construct idols and other structures of worship. Combat is of the hack ‘n slash variety as you cut down rival cult leaders, non-believers, and monsters. The game looks wild, and we hope it lives up to its potential when it arrives later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Elden Ring launching tonight (or already out in some places), Bandai Namco have released notes for the day-one patch. While this is probably more notable to console players buying the game on a 'disc' (some sort of tangible version of Spotify, I think?), perhaps you might be interested to see what's changed since the version of the game reviewers reviewed? You know, all those glowing, effusive reviews, who evidently weren't super-bothered by these issues. But it's good to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Influential first-person exploration game Dear Esther released commercially 10 years ago this month. But before it was on the front page of Steam and selling like hotcakes, it was a Half Life 2 mod cooked up by designer and writer Dan Pinchbeck and a group of friends. “I was doing a PhD, weirdly, on first person shooters,” Pinchbeck says. As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/24/sony-asks-court-to-dismiss-class-action-lawsuit-against-it-for-alleged-gender"/>
        <updated>2022-02-24T16:22:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has asked a court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against it first filed in November of last year that alleges gender discrimination within the company. 
Former Sony IT security analyst, Emma Majo, sought court approval to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit last year on behalf of other women who worked for the company in the past. She alleged that “Sony discriminates against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men,” as reported by Axios last year. 
Now, Sony is asking a court to dismiss Majo’s class-action case against it, citing a lack of facts to support the claims presented in the lawsuit, Axios reports. 
“Despite the sweeping breadth of her lawsuit, the allegations in which [Sony Interactive Entertainment] categorically denies, she fails to plead facts to support either her individual claims or the claims of the broad-based classes of women she seeks to represent,” Sony’s lawyer wrote, according to court documents. 
Furthermore, Sony writes in documents that Majo failed to “identify a single policy, practice, or procedure at SIE that allegedly formed the basis of any widespread intentional discrimination or had a discriminatory impact on women,” and that Majo’s “widespread claims of harassment are based solely on unactionable allegations of run-of-the-mill personnel activity.” 
Sony also asks the court to recognize what it calls a conflict of interest, too. Majo’s lawsuit includes an attempt to include all women who worked for SIE. Sony says this would include all of Majo’s managers since 2017, which were all women. Sony’s lawyer says that if those managers are included in the suit against Sony, “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” rise. 
Only time will tell if the court approves Sony’s request to dismiss the case.

Contrary to what I say on the recording, this is in fact episode 175 of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. I probably got it wrong because I'd been up all night at the discotheque. Yes, this week we're taking a suggestion from the listeners and talking about our favourite nightclubs in games. And three more qualified people to talk about clubbing you would not meet.
But first this week there's some big Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill news to get out of the way, plus we discuss drinking animal blood in VIP sections (which is what rich people do), and at what point it stops being cool to go to a nightclub. For me? Almost immediately. And me and Matthew have actually been playing a game, but it's a PlayStation game so please don't listen to us talk about it. But you should definitely listen to Matthew's Hitman-themed Cavern Of Lies.

Elden Ring finally hits consoles and PC tomorrow, and today, one day before its release, Bandai Namco and From Software have released the patch notes for Patch 1.02, which is essentially the game’s day-one patch. 
In it, you’ll find numerous fixes, bug squashes, and more. If this day-one patch is like previous ones, it’s likely you won’t even be playing the game until after this update has been installed. If you’re buying the game physically or already have it pre-loaded with a digital purchase, this update will likely be pushed before you begin the game.

Here’s what to expect from Patch 1.02 in Elden Ring: 
Improved player controls
Addition and adjustments of background music
Text adjustments
Balance adjustments
NPC event fixes and adjustments
Fixed frame rate drops under certain conditions
Fixed text bug in some languages
Fixed a bug that prevented the Xbox wireless headset from working properly 
These patch notes also include a quick note about the game’s forthcoming implementation of ray-tracing, citing this support is planned for after the game’s launch tomorrow and that more details about it will be revealed in “future announcements.” 
While waiting for this patch to download and install, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to determine why we gave it a 10 out of 10. Watch the official Elden Ring launch trailer after that, and then check out this breakdown of the global launch times for Elden Ring to find out exactly when you can start playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the game where you peel a dead woman’s face off. You do it slowly, with a blunt dog tag, making several raggedy incisions before tearing off the face proper. After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. 


Apart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead. They suck. Horror games are allowed to be horrific, but the way to cultivate real fear is through restraint rather than desensitising bombardment. For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer:
      Nintendo
      
Nintendo has announced that it is acquiring SRD Co. LTD., a long-time development partner that has worked on titles within franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.
If you’ve been paying attention to the video game industry as of late, you likely already know that 2022 has so far been defined by one word: acquisitions. 
It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion, and then two weeks later, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie, the developer behind Destiny 2, for $3.6 billion.
Nintendo revealed earlier this month that despite acquisitions happening throughout the industry, it wasn’t going to change its investment plans. It also revealed that it’s not against acquisitions they deem necessary and it seems acquiring SRD was the next necessary move for the Kyoto-based company. 
SRD was founded in 1979 and has worked closely with Nintendo for decades, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Not only has it worked with Nintendo on Mario and Zelda games, but the studio has helped develop Animal Crossing entries, Game Builder Garage, 1-2 Switch, and Ring Fit Adventure. This acquisition transaction is expected to be complete by April 1, 2022, and at the time of this writing, a price has not been named. 
Nintendo said in a statement that acquiring SRD will “serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo,” according to Video Games Chronicle. 
Today’s news about this acquisition is the first following Nintendo’s purchase of Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer, Next Level Games, back in January of last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Square Enix started re-releasing older Final Fantasy games on PC a few years back, it was a mixed blessing. Yeah, they were officially available on PC, but we got them all blurry from shoddily remastered mobile versions. Recognising that people wanted pixels not smears, Square Enix last year started releasing 'Pixel Remasters' of the early series. That's now complete with today's launch of Final Fantasy VI's Pixel Remaster version. That's the one with the clown.

      Sony Interactive Entertainment
      
Since the previous PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles, game captures such as screenshots and videos have become more and more popular. With the start of this current generation back in 2020, it was clear that PlayStation and Xbox were going to encourage us even more to share our best captures. 
Doing so on Xbox Series X/S, and even Xbox One, has been relatively easy when it comes to getting images and videos off of the hard drive and onto your phone, for example. You simply capture what you want and in a few minutes, it’ll be automatically uploaded to the official Xbox app. From there, you can save and download the image to your phone, which makes sharing it on social media a breeze. However, that wasn’t possible on PlayStation, despite how much players wanted this feature…until now.

As you can see in the video above, PlayStation has rolled this feature out for PS5 players. You’ll need to enable it in your console’s settings and the PlayStation App first, of course, but after that, screenshots and videos under three minutes long will be automatically uploaded to the PlayStation App. They’ll remain there for 14 days and during that time you can save and download any images or videos you want to your mobile device. And, much like with Xbox game captures, this makes it much easier to share your captures with friends and others on social media. 
For more about the PS5, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 PlayStation 5 games and then check out these details about the latest PS5 beta, which adds extra party chat options, game base enhancements, UI changes, and more to the console. Read about the PS5 covers and new DualSense colors after that.

Like previous lineups, this one includes one PlayStation 5 game in Ghostrunner and two PlayStation 4 games in Ark: Survival Evolved and Team Sonic Racing. On top of those games, though, both PS5 and PS4 players can add Ghost of Tsushima: Legends to the…]]></summary>

Look out, monsters are attacking the city! Except it’s you! If the idea of stomping through cities as massive kaiju or giant robots gets your blood pumping, then the upcoming Dawn of the Monsters may be up your alley.

The 2D beat 'em up by 13AM Games and Wayforward lets up to two players assume the gargantuan roles of monsters and mechs to lay the smackdown on equally titanic adversaries. You're more than just a lumbering brute, as you can outfit these beasts with various mods and abilities to broaden your offensive arsenal. The result is a chaotic monster mash that also boasts a sharp look thanks to its comic book-inspired aesthetic. 
Interested? Then watch as Alex Stadnik, Marcus Stewart, and 13AM designer Tom McCall show off Dawn of the Monsters’ over-the-top gameplay and systems.

Rapper Machine Gun Kelly has hopped aboard the hype train for WWE 2K22, severing as an official partner by providing his music and shaping the game's soundtrack. He’s also set to become a playable superstar himself. 
2K has announced that MGK will arrive as part of a post-launch content pack (which has no release date), so don’t expect to do this to him on release day:

Kelly serves as executive producers on 2K22's soundtrack, helping curate its tunes which include the following:
Machine Gun Kelly - "Concert for Aliens"
Machine Gun Kelly ft. Yungblud & Bert McCracken - "Body Bag"
Wu-Tang Clan - "Protect Ya Neck"
Motorhead - "Iron Fist"
Poppy - "Say Cheese" (Live NXT version)
Royal Blood - "Typhoons"
Bring Me The Horizon - "Happy Song"
The Weeknd - "Heartless"
Turnstile - "I Don't Wanna Be Blind"
Asking Alexandria - "The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)”
KennyHoopla - "Hollywood Sucks."
I know it seems weird, but Kelly is a known wrestling fan and has made several appearances on WWE programming over the years so the partnership makes sense and must be pretty cool for him. I just want to know what his rating and moveset would be. Also, does this open the door for Bad Bunny to join the roster? Because I would unironically be down for that.
WWE 2K22 arrives March 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can view the full list of the confirmed superstars here.]]></summary>

They did it. They did the thing. And it’s awesome. 
If you’ve seen Spider-Man: No Way Home, then you know of its biggest secrets (which is one of the movie industry’s worst-kept secrets): there are three Spider-Mans, err, Spider-Men, in it and accompanying Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire’s own iteration of the character. In the movie, they kind of allude to the most infamous Spider-Man meme out there – the three Spider-Man pointing at each other, surprised to see other iterations of themselves – but now, Marvel has released a better, official version of it. 
As you can see in the image above, Holland, Maguire, and Garfield perfectly replicated the meme in their own suits and it’s everything we imagined it would be. Plus, it comes alongside news that Spider-Man: No Way Home can be streamed digitally on March 22 before it hits 4K and Blu-ray on April 12. 
After you calm down from the glory that is that image, read about this announcement for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, and then check out this trailer for Insomniac’s Wolverine game now in development. Read why one Game Informer editor believes this Wolverine needs to occupy the same world as Insomniac’s Spider-Man after that.

Ed Boon has likely been making video games longer than you’ve been alive. Years before he became the steward of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Boon was programming pinball and arcade games for companies that no longer exist. But despite his over 30-year history in the industry, he’s only ever really had one job.
To get a full view of what such a storied career looks like, we talked with Boon about his early days at Williams Electronics, some of the names Mortal Kombat could have had, and what it’s like working on the same series for over two decades.

A Plague Tale: Requiem doesn’t have a release date yet, but that hasn’t stopped publisher Focus Entertainment from unveiling a rather cool Collector’s Edition.
The centerpiece of this bundle, pictured above, is a resin statue of protagonists Amicia and Hugo. Standing 8.3 inches tall, Amicia takes aim with her new crossbow. 
The bundle also includes the following items (none of which are supernatural rats, thankfully):
A Plague Tale: Requiem game with store-exclusive cover art
Collector’s box
45 RPM vinyl (2 tracks)
Hugo’s metal feather brooch (2.4") 
3 A4 lithographs
Additionally, buying the Collector’s Edition gets you the Protector Pack which includes these in-game items:
Red Damsel crossbow skin
Bonus crafting material
13 exclusive cosmetic items for Amicia
The entire package will set you back $189.99 and it’s only available at the Focus Entertainment Store. 
A Plague Tale: Requiem is the sequel to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence. Amicia and Hugo find themselves on another rat-infested journey in search of an island believed to contain a secret for curing Hugo’s curse. The game launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch (cloud version), and PC.

This patch takes aim at several issues in the game, such as an oversharpening of the screen image when HDR is on, and it fixes dozens of them while also listing out known issues the team is working on. It’s par for the course as far as post-launch patches go but if you’ve held off on playing, Horizon Forbidden West is now an even better game as a result. And if you have been p…]]></summary>

Platinum Games’ Nier: Automata is getting an anime. 
This was revealed by publisher Square Enix during the game’s fifth anniversary livestream today by way of a new teaser trailer that you can watch below. The teaser, which is quite brief clocking in at just 31 seconds, doesn’t reveal too much at all. It showcases what could perhaps be the anime’s animation style, although it could just be concept art of 2B and her Pod companion bot. 
Click here to watch embedded media
As you can see in the trailer above, there’s not too much to glean from it. However, Square Enix released some additional information about it after the fact, revealing that in this anime, humans have left Earth to go to the moon as a result of an overwhelming amount of seemingly dangerous machines on their home planet. 2B, who is playable in Nier: Automata, is sent back down to Earth to help reclaim the planet and if you’re at all familiar with the game, you can probably see where this anime might be heading.
Aniplex, the studio behind anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, is working on this Nier: Automata anime. 
While waiting for this anime to drop, read Game Informer’s Nier: Automata review and then check out this story about the upgrade patch Nier: Automata finally received on Steam after fans have been asking for it for four years. Read Game Informer’s Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 review after that.

"Nothing but grief here", you mark by Bloodborne. "Time for crab", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.
But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. "Visions of joy" sums it up nicely.

Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio’s last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time. From my initial for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance problems marred the launch of Total War: Warhammer 3 last week, which is a shame because the fantasy strategy game is otherwise pretty great. The developers, Creative Assembly say they're working on fixing it. Yesterday they laid out their plans for improving performance, stability, and a few other issues, expecting to launch the first 'hotfix' patch this week. But some issues have many causes, so they warn it'll take time and multiple patches to really fix the game.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 was an infuriating mess in so many ways when I reviewed it at the end of 2020, but a funny thing would happen every time I'd stop playing it. All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.
So I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2012, the late great Antony Bourdain tweeted an impassioned defence of a fellow food writer, then 85 year old Marilyn Hagerty, whose recent positive review of her local Olive Garden had become the subject of widespread memery. I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.


Big Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.

Update, 2/22/22:
After being suspended for more than two months, the free trial for Final Fantasy XIV is back and open to any and all players. 
The official FFXIV Twitter account announced the news today. For the uninitiated, the free trial was suspended back in December following widespread congestion issues in FFXIV. Those issues occurred as a result of the rapid growth the MMO experienced ahead of its Endwalker expansion launch. The free trial is live once more, though, which means players can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free, wit…]]></summary>

Yoshida also mentioned the game's first planned graphical update, and a partial roadmap of new content to come in future patches.

Bungie’s latest expansion for Destiny 2, The Witch Queen, is now live and so is the accompanying Season of the Risen that will run until May 24. 
To help celebrate the launch of this new expansion and subsequent season, the studio, which is being acquired by Sony, released a Season of the Risen overview trailer that highlights what Guardians should expect. As expected, it’s all centered around Savathûn and the Hive, which is now in possession of the Light. You can watch the trailer below:

As you can see, this season will be all about kiling Light-wielding Hive (and just good ole regular Hive, too). It seems a Cabal friend will be joining the fight to make it a little easier well. And of course, who could forget about the overarching villain, Savathûn the Witch Queen, who is sure to make virtually everything this season more challenging. 
Destiny 2’s Witch Queen expansion and Season of the Risen is now live. When you need a break from Savathûn, read this opinion piece about why Destiny 2’s recent season conclusion shows the good and bad of living game content and then watch this Destiny 2: The Witch Queen launch trailer. Check out this amazing Destiny 2 Savathûn statue after that.

Square Enix has released some new financial results for its first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2022-23, something companies like EA and Activision Blizzard did earlier this month, and in it, the company reveals that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy did not meet sales expectations. 
This news comes alongside Square Enix revealing in its quarterly results that its net sales were lower this year than the same period in the previous fiscal year, which saw the release of titles like Final Fantasy VII Remake and Marvel’s Avengers on new-gen consoles. Speaking specifically to the release of Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Square Enix acknowledges that it reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it a 8.5 out of 10. However, it underperformed financially.

“The HD Games sub-segment launched ‘Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy’ in Q3,” the results read. “Despite strong reviews, the game’s sales on launch undershot our initial expectations.”
Square Enix says that it has been using sales initiatives that it kicked off in November of 2021 to increase sales and the company intends to “work to continue to expand sales to make up for the title’s slow start.”
Hopefully, those sales can get Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy up to expectations, and even past it, because it certainly warrants a sequel that we’d like to see. For now, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy review and then check out these Adidas sneakers inspired by the game. Read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that.

Eyes up, Guardians! Savathûn, the Hive god and Witch Queen has harnessed the Light to do her bidding. With it, she has molded part of her throne world into an opulent white cathedral and has gifted her Lucent Brood with powers, not unlike those the Guardians wield. Survival for Earth's champions is a must, and doing so means taking the fight to Savathûn's home turf and facing her terrifying Light-wielding forces head-on.

Bandai Namco released a new launch trailer for Elden Ring, which hits consoles and PC this Friday, and it promises a celebration of war for champions of the Lands Between. 
As you might expect with an Elden Ring trailer, or really any From Software game trailer, it’s not easy to parse together exactly what’s happening. A narrator talks about a celebration of war, possibly in a tournament-like setting, while another talks about heroes becoming forsaken and more. It’s a lot to wrap one’s head around but even if you aren’t determined to piece together the new lore presented in the trailer, there’s plenty to see.

There are some new looks at bosses and enemies as well as new settings and locales, too. We even get a look at a boss that looks very celestial and Bloodborne-like – could there be a Bloodborne connection in Elden Ring? Who knows? For now, only time will tell and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because Elden Ring hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Friday, on February 25. 
If you’re curious as to when exactly you can head into the Lands Between, check out the Elden Ring global launch times. Read Game Informer’s Elden Ring cover story after that for tons of details about what to expect and then check out this exclusive Elden Ring gameplay featuring Castle Mourne.

It’s time for the payoff. For years, Bungie has teased the potential of Destiny’s most devious villain. In recent months, that tease has escalated. The Hive queen named Savathûn has infiltrated all the major storylines, insinuating herself into the events shaping the story. Now, at long last, the Witch Queen’s trap is sprung, as she co-opts humanity’s most precious resource – the Light that gives power to its Guardians – and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her own. 
With The Witch Queen, Bungie is betting big on a narrative twist that’s been in the makin…]]></summary>

I would also like someone to explain the Pullcaster to me, because it's one thing in Horizon Forbidden West that, as far as I can tell, does not need to exist whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Elden Ring doesn't launch for another few days, the launch trailer launched today. Like many people, I'm trying to avoid the new grim adventure from the makers of Dark Souls as much as possible, because I want to go in innocent, wide-eyed, full of surprise, and wholly unwarned of the many deaths awaiting me. So I'll share the launch trailer with you but I won't watch it myself. Even the game's marketing team warn that it shows things we've not seen before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Souls begins by creating the universe. “In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog,” intones the opening cinematic. “A land of gray crags, archtrees and everlasting dragons.” Those two sentences do a lot of heavy lifting. “We needed to conjure an image of the world in its previous static state, where concepts that we take for granted - the finite nature of life and all conceptual contrasts - were nonexistent,” says Ryan Morris, lead translator at Frognation, the Tokyo and London-based consultancy that has handled the majority of From's Souls or Souls-type projects, from the original Demon's Souls to this year's Elden Ring. “I think of the singularity that existed before the Big Bang.”

Finally, I could live out my dream of sliding down tree branches like Disney's Tarzan, all while playing another gorgeous adventure from the makers of Old Man's Journey and Secrets Of Raetikon. Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw it was going to be part of this week's Steam Next Fest. The developers have said upfront that the game is only around an hour long, and with this week's demo stretching to a generous 20 minutes, part of me's now quite sad that I've already seen a third of it in action. 
The other part of me, however, is absolutely thrilled, and it's all down to my gibbon's sick, speed-boosting backflips.

While the console versions will have staggered launches around the world at midnight local time (mostly), on PC it's a simultaneous global launch. Depending on where you live, this could mean you get to start playing on PC hours before your consolable chums—or you could be waiting hours. Preloading is due to start tonight, too.

As with the previous entry, FAR: Changing Tides tasks you with scurrying around a hulking vessel to manage the various contraptions that keep it moving.

In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much to my great shame, I never got round to playing Deathloop at the end of last year. Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've said before that I reckon Rainbow Six Extraction is far more than a Rainbow Six Siege spin-off. That's thanks to its emphasis on teamwork and co-ordination. Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

Truth be told, we’ve had one for about a week (specifically our hardware editor James, the lucky duck), but as we approach its official launch date next Friday, we want to know if you have any burning questions we can help answer. James will be delivering his full review next week, putting the handheld through its paces from a performance standpoint, but if you'd like us to cover something specific about it, now's the time to tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dirigo Games impressed former RPS neck honcho Adam Smith with Depths Of Fear, and later added  two excellent games to to The Bundle. Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

These shows still might never get made, by anyone. But maybe it's enough of a step forwards for you to start daydreaming about what such shows could be?

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of former CD Projekt Red folks have formed a new studio, announcing plans to make their own "AAA" "story-driven" "dark fantasy RPG". The studio are named Rebel Wolves, and they're founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who was director of The Witcher 3 and secondary game director on Cyberpunk 2077. Their RPG is largely a mystery for now, though a wee bit of artwork suggests at least one vampire is involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out There has been described as everything from a "pacifistic take on FTL" to "Gravity without the chain of astonishing coincidences" in the halls of this parish. Having originally begun life on mobile devices back in 2013, this combat-free space exploration and resource management game arrived on PC two years later as part of a snazzed up Ω Edition, putting you in the shoes of a lone astronaut trying to survive on the fringes of deep space. It was also bloody difficult, with a punishing brutality lying beneath its serene and comforting surface - something that developer Mi-Clos Studio's founder and creative director Michaël Peiffert has been keen to address with its upcoming sequel, Out There: Oceans Of Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The huge new patch released for Cyberpunk 2077 yesterday is mostly a good'un, bringing the dystopian RPG closer to the game it should have been 14 months ago. But Update 1.5 might be bad news for players with older PCs. CD Projekt Red have officially ended support for Nvidia GeForce 700 series graphics cards, and announced plans to end Windows 7 support later this year. This isn't immediately bad, but the game could end up breaking on affected computers in the future.

It's not yet clear how many of the handheld PC's parts will be sold officially, though Valve had previously suggested they might include "thumbsticks, SSDs, and possibly more".

I had to buy new carpet recently, and Carpet Man told me that the only shade of carpet anyone wants nowadays is grey, resting one hand on his hip and the other on a pile of pile. He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.
Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A handful of popular Cities: Skylines mods have been banned from the Steam Workshop by developers Colossal Order. One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

This news came alongside tonight's 'Panel From Hell' livestream focused on Patch 7, where Larian revealed the Barbarian class and the Improvised Weapons system which lets you wield even enemies as weapons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

So as an alternative to spending £100-odd for all a game's DLC, Paradox have started dabbling in letting players pay monthly fees to play them. The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.
