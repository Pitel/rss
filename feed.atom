Often, the actual delivery portion of any given space game is optional. There’s usually piracy, combat, maybe mining. There are lots of ways to make a buck in the endless expanse of the universe. Star Trucker, on the other hand, is entirely about trucking through the stars. It’s more than just pressing the pedal down; but all its additional features are in service of your delivery.

        <updated>2024-09-09T19:57:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re planning on refining a melee build in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you may see that there are three defense types such as block, balance, and fencing. 


The former two are straightforward, so what is fencing? We’ll break this down below and compare it between the other two types.


What is fencing in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2?


Fencing is a defense type on melee weapons that is primarily focused on performing parries. This is one of the stronger options if you’re trying to maintain your health and armor upkeep. 


It requires better timing when you see a blue enemy circle indicating they’re about to attack. In other cases, you can still parry attacks that don’t appear with the indicator as long as it isn’t the lethal red one.


Fencing compared to block and balance


Fencing is a high-risk, high-reward playstyle compared to the other two defense types. Your timing has to be good. Otherwise, you’ll suffer a lot of damage and possibly go down, especially with higher difficulties.


With balance, you can play defensively or use parrying. This is if you want to still parry but also block if you get overrun or you’re still practicing on your timing.


Lastly, the block defense type lives up to its name. It focuses on blocking attacks and having massive damage reduction over performing reversals. If your timing is bad or you are going to rely on other players to take out big, this is going to be more up your alley.

Is fencing the best defense type?


Technically, this would be the best type, but it’s dependent on your skill. Performing a parry means that you’ll be performing finisher attacks more often on enemies. 


During these finisher animations on enemies, you’re completely invulnerable. So, performing these back-to-back will make you even more tanky and an excellent bait for other players to take out high-priority targets like Majoris and Extremis-level enemies.

This semi-auto rifle can be used at mid to long range and packs way more of a punch compared to its other bolt-style rifle counterparts. All you need is a few well-placed shots into your enemies and they should go down. It complements the playstyles of teammates who prefer playing close quarters.

JJK creator Gege Akutami first announced the manga's ending, marking its conclusion after a select few chapters. The saga's official page also confirmed a more precise date: Sept. 30, 2024. That means Chapter 271 will be the last of the series, tying into the Shinjuku Showdown arc.


You can look forward to the remaining chapters, which will debut every Sunday until the end of September. They can typically be read for free on Viz Media or Manga Plus, featuring other recent storylines.

As for what we can expect from Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending, it could go down in plenty of ways. I won't go into too much about what's been happening in the manga to avoid any spoilers, but I will say that it does correlate with the main objective of bringing the infamous Sukuna down. Whatever the case may be for the manga, the conclusion will undoubtedly explain what happens to the Jujutsu Sorcerers or even include one more battle just for kicks.


Fortunately, the JJK adventures have yet to conclude with the promise of new episodes. While not much is known about Season 3, we can remain hopeful for more details in the coming months. There's still a lot to dig into with the anime's current place in the timeline, which may cover the entirety of its following season. Given the success of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, there's a good chance we might see the show's ending as a film instead. We'll possibly get more information about this once the manga concludes.

How to Collect Souls for Fusion


Getting different souls is a bit of a vague process, so we'll give a quick breakdown of best practices. First and foremost, you'll want the Soul Eater Ring. The problem is that it's not available until the later half of the game. Worse still, it's prohibitively expensive at 300,000g. But once you acquire it, it doubles the rate at which enemies drop their souls when you defeat them.

For its part, McDonald's has made its own Twittter/X post with a "quest" to text a certain number. From the account's bio, it looks like there will be more quests to come. They've also changed their profile picture and banner to feature images from Mondstadt, which is a nice touch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus' next big RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio looks to be a visual treat from its imaginative fantasy locations to its illustrious menu UI. Hopefully, you meet the Metaphor: ReFantazio PC system requirements to make this game look glorious on your monitor or TV.


Metaphor: ReFantazio PC system requirements - minimum specs


To run Metaphor: Fantazio at 720p resolution with 30 frames per second (FPS), you'll need the following specs, according to the game's Steam listing:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 or AMD FX-6300


Memory: 6 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 4GB or AMD Radeon R7 360, 4GB or Intel Arc A310, 4GB


DirectX: Version 11


Storage: 93 GB available space



The game's developer Atlus and the publisher Sega also say that you require a CPU with AVX support. You can check if your Intel processor has this functionality by looking up the Instruction Set Extensions from the CPU Technologies tab in the Intel Processor Identification Utility app. Most modern computers should have AVX support.

Metaphor: ReFantazio is fairly beefy with 93GB of storage being taken. However, it's smaller than other RPGs like Starfield or Final Fantasy XVI.


Recommended specs for Metaphor: ReFantazio


If you want this gorgeous Atlus game to run with 1080p resolution at 60 FPS, you'll need the following:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i5-7600 or Ryzen 5 2600


Memory: 8 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, 4GB or AMD Radeon RX 480, 4GB or Intel Arc A380, 6GB


DirectX: Version 11


Storage: 93 GB available space



You'll want to at least match the recommended specs for this game because our preview said "It might be one of the most stylish games [..] in some time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As spotted by Nintendo Wire, Sanei has a new Super Mario Wonder plush, this one based on those incessant talking flowers. Wait, do those things have names? Apparently, they’re just “Talking Flower.”


The announcement came in the form of a single Tweet, so there aren’t too many details on it. I don’t know what you’d want to know. They talk. It would be weird if they didn’t. I also don’t know why you’d want it to. Some people played through Super Mario Wonder without muting those awful things. Normally, I’d assume that this is because they didn’t know they could be turned off, but some people supposedly like them. I have hated them since the first trailer.




Ugh, they sound worse in Japanese. “Ganbare!” it shrieks upon the first squeeze. “Kimi no bouken wo…” Why? What was the point of these things? They make me want to salt the earth. “Waaaaandaaaaaa!” it screams, as though it cries in anguish at the falling heavens in some dramatic movie.


The quality of the plush at least looks pretty good. I want to say that some of the stuffies from the Mario series I have around my apartment were made by Sanei. Just checked; they are. I have a 1-up mushroom that has lasted me since college, so that’s a good sign. It’s important to note that the Talking Mushroom also has a cavity in its face, which you could use to put your… popcorn in. I don’t know.


The Talking Mushroom is out in November in Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.
That Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.
Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.

Zelda Lore shared an excerpt of the book on Twitter (thanks to Gaming Reinvented for the tip) which covers the potential whereabouts of Kass in Tears of the Kingdom. The bird isn't present in Hyrule at all in the game, with no explanation at all given for his absence. He's not even mentioned. At least, until the Master Works book.

The world's greatest thief Carmen Sandiego is no stranger to video games, but amazingly, she's managed to avoid the Switch in her near-40-year career. That is, until next year when Carmen Sandiego will be coming to all consoles.
Revealed by IGN, Carmen Sandiego appears to be based on the 2019-2021 Netflix series, where the titular thief is no longer the one you're chasing — you're now rooting for her. Controlling Carmen Sandiego, you'll be attempting to defeat the Villains' International League of Evil (VILE), which she once belonged to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanna take you for a ride.
There was some deserved hype surrounding Capcom’s first Fighting Collection, preserving the best of Street Fighter and Darkstalkers, and including a delicious Red Earth bonus for good measure. The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.
Featuring seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.

Yooka-Replaylee was a bit of a welcome surprise when it was announced back in June. It looks utterly gorgeous and promises plenty of tweaks, changes, and accessibility features when it eventually launches. But one thing that many fans spotted was Laylee, Yooka's purple bat companion, and her new, incredibly fluffy design.
In a Q&A published on the Playtonic YouTube Channel, community manager Steve James sat down with members of the Yooka-Replaylee art team — Ed Bryan, Nikita De Ruysscher, and Steve Mayles — to talk about the game's brand new look. And one section focuses on the wisecracking bat.

In a recent interview on the Fragments of Silicon podcast, WayForward's James Montagana revealed how last year's collaboration came to be, stating that the team had been meeting with Nintendo at every E3 for seven or eight years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hack the planet, wizard fans. A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's-a not!
Researchers from tech company Virtuals Protocol have published a paper on a new text-to-video AI model, MarioVGG, which can simulate Super Mario Bros. footage via some basic text inputs (thanks, ArsTechnica).
The model was fed over 737,000 Mario Bros. frames, showing Nintendo's prized plumber in 32 different levels with varying degrees of success and failure (141 wins and 139 losses, according to Github). Based on these images, and how they are arranged, the AI model "learns" what commands such as "jump" and "run" correspond to on-screen and is then capable of simulating such commands in a video format, physics and all.

The leaves flake from the boughs like the dandruff of Pan, god of the wild - pandruff, perhaps? The waters of the rivers thicken, rejecting the fading sunlight, and the big coffee chains start doing monstrous things with hazelnut syrup. The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

This information comes from the new Zelda art book 'Master Works', with the game's producer Eiji Aonuma revealing there was a period during this lengthy sequel project when the name could have ended up being 'Tears of the Dragon'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for horror game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

Hironobu Sakaguchi needs no introduction. As the father of the Final Fantasy franchise, he's the mind behind one of the most successful and popular JRPG series of all time.

Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gearbox developers working on Risk Of Rain 2 have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

"It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black & White was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

It's out now and will no doubt please fans who've been waiting years for a sequel to the original Gimmick!, and possibly other platform enthusiasts who are after a decidedly different style of gap-hopper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major sports rightsholders and broadcasters in Canada have selected UK-based site-blocking veterans Friend MTS to carry out all pirate IPTV blocking under a Federal Court injunction obtained during the summer. The fact that NHL, NBA, and Premier League streams will be blocked by major Canadian ISPs was widely reported. Yet, with significantly less fanfare, it appears that the UFC and MLB have also entered the blocking arena.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in July, No Man's Sky reached version 5.0 with the Worlds update, which refreshed its planetary generation to introduce more variety alongside more detailed water, clouds, and weather. We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.

Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's Minecraft movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darkest Dungeon 2's Kingdoms mode - a free turn-based boardgame reimagining of the hellish roguelike roadtrip RPG - will release in three modules, Red Hook have announced. The first of this fearful trio, Hunger Of The Beast Clan, is down to launch in Q4 2024, which translates to sometime during the period 1st October to 31st December.
It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The complication: competing against other actual human beings isn't always pleasant or desirable, especially when hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

A shiny whippet to the first of you to correctly identify which of these are real, and which were invented for “roguelite word puzzle RPG” Sternly Worded Adventures. Actually, scratch that. I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the Steam demo. I think you should, if only because “I killed a slime by spelling out the word Toblerone” is easily in my top ten gaming moments of the year.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time.

At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.
Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

Ah, I've been waiting a while for this one. Catch a new trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything I know about the French Revolution has hitherto come from two literary works: Hilary Mantel's excellent doorstopper A Place Of Greater Safety, and Kate Beaton's webcomics. Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Age of Empires with dinosaurs" is, the developers of the Dinolords recently told me in a cramped Gamescom booth, a flattering description for their upcoming England vs. Vikingsaurus RTS. It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the ballroom scene from Disney's Beauty And The Beast, swap the wailing utensils for an army of chibi cats, endow Belle with low-key Doctor Manhattan-grade powers of matter transformation, and you're perhaps beginning to approximate the experience of Infinity Nikki - an open world dress-up adventure from Singapore-based Infold and former Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild developer Kentaro Tominaga.
Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months back, I enjoyed lurking a conversation on the RPS Discord about the proliferation of cyberpunk/steampunk/atompunk/what-have-you-punk variants and how most of them in fact lack the rebelliousness and counter-counter elements that punk actually entails. That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can guarantee you that a zombie survival game called God Save Birmingham wasn't on your "2024 Video Game Announcements" bingo card. It takes place in 14th century England, and tasks you with fending off the rampant zombie hordes of a populace who've succumbed to a mysterious case of reanimation. Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m still a little giddy over how much I enjoyed lucarne-lobbing puzzler Tactical Breach Wizards. So much so that I mentioned in my review how I’m well up for another run of its fifteen hour campaign. I’d already got a few missions into hard mode. There's no more starting mana points! It’s a real...pane.
Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?
