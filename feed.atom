Following successful funding on Kickstarter, the turn-based tactical strategy game Warside has finally locked in a release date. It will launch for Switch and multiple other platforms on 28th January 2025.
In case you missed our existing coverage of this one, as you can see, it's heavily inspired by a certain Nintendo series. The developer previously mentioned how it felt it could "evolve" the genre and was happy to cite not only Advance Wars but also series like Wargroove and Into The Breach as inspirations.

        <updated>2025-01-30T00:07:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks looking for another promising roguelite action game to sink some time into can now mark their calendars for this spring. Game Source Entertainment locked in an April 24 launch date for Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade, a stylish-looking actioner that's on the way to PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


Taiwanese indie developer 7Quark is behind the action-RPG, which unfurls its take on the story of the Nine-Tailed Fox in Edo era Japan. Also known as the "King of Demons," the beast's arrival upsets the previously-established peace between humans and demons. As one might expect, that serves as a nice excuse for some fast-paced hackin' and slashin'.


You can see some of that in action along with a look at the main characters in the new trailer:




The three main characters each have notable Japanese voice talent behind them. Yoko Hikasa (Minami in Dr. STONE) voices the Demon Blade-wielding immortal ninja known as Shigure. Ayana Taketatsu (Leafa in Sword Art Online) voices Oni Emissary Sara, and Rikiya Koyama (Taiga Saejima in Yakuza/Like a Dragon) voices demon samurai and master archer Taketora. 


Throughout the adventure, weapons can be upgraded, recipes can be discovered, and alliances can be forged with "kind-hearted demons." Uh huh, we've heard that one before. Nice try, demons. 


For those who want to check it out before it drops this April, a demo is currently available on Steam. It's billed as an "evolving demo," so more is on the way in the future. As of right now, Steam Next Fest is the next approaching milestone. Look for the first half of Chapter One, new seasonal scenery, new enemies, and a new boss stage to be added to the sampler platter soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is one of the most popular ways to play the famous card game, and Konami supports its digital simulator by giving it its own unique format. As opposed to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game or Official Card Game formats, which receive updates to their Forbidden & Limited Lists every few months, Master Duel sees updates to its list about once a month. These frequent lists are often used to micro-adjust the metagame and test to see what's actually working. The list that goes into effect on February 5th, 2025 follows that example, but with a few big changes.

BO6 'join failed because you are on a different version' error solutions


The BO6 'different version' error appears whenever you're trying to join a party. Standard fixes like restarting your game or installing a new patch don't seem to address it, but fortunately, players have discovered a few workarounds with these methods:



Join a 'Recent Players' lobby and connect with your friend from the other player's lobby

While the system was designed with two players in mind, the limitations of the hardware threw up a lot of obstacles, and there was never an elegant way around them. Elegance is overrated.


So, while multiplayer was better in arcades and would only start catching up in later generations, anyone who experienced the console in its prime probably has some great memories of sharing the unit with a chum. So, if you’re looking to recapture that feeling, or if you’re new to the console and want to explore it with a friend, then I’ve got some picks for you, in no particular order.

The spotlight here is on a new Arc keyword, Bolt Charge, that lets you repeatedly target foes with lightning strikes. Of course, that's not all from the finale Episode of The Final Shape, as new Aspects are also inbound to help shake up the gameplay sandbox.


While these tweaks and additions don't come with every Tuesday reset in Destiny 2, they often appear in significant updates. With three Episodes for The Final Shape, the structure allowed Bungie a well-defined period of four or so months before changing things up when a new Episode arrived.

With the truly shocking confirmation that, alongside the new console, Nintendo is busy assembling a follow-up entry to the best-selling game on Switch, it's got us thinking about what we really want from a new Mario Kart.
In all honesty, we've been thinking about this for years, arguably since before we knew that Mario Kart 8 would be getting a Deluxe reprieve and assumed the new hotness on Switch would be totally new. Don't get us wrong — Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an astonishing product, and we're huge fans of the enormous Booster Course Pass DLC, but we've been playing the same game in some form for over a decade now and we're jonesing for a fresh take.

"Look at my spaceship go," you say to yourself, "look how fast it crashes into that other, smaller ship." Building your own galactic snowpiercer from scratch in Space Engineers 2 will bring a smile to anyone who once revelled in clicking together Lego podracers and bashing them into one another on the living room carpet with a violence eight-year-olds should not yet have mental access to. That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

To watch all of Naruto: Shippuden, you’ll need over 200 hours spare (more than 8 days), and that’s one hell of a time sink and a rather daunting commitment. And that’s without adding in the time to watch the original series first, and then the huge number of Boruto episodes that come after.

The first prison escape board game that instantly comes to my mind is “Prison Break”, based on the hit TV show of the same name, which aired between 2006 and 2017. However, for some bizarre reason, the Prison Break board game was only ever released in French, and I’m hedging my bets that you’re looking for something more English to play. 


If that’s the case, here are 10 alternative board games that will have you fleeing captivity in one way or another.

What is Piranhado in Diablo 4?


As stated earlier, Piranhado is a new Witchcraft power that you can use in Season 7 of Diablo 4. It pairs with powers that cast both Hex and Auras, grouping enemies together and dealing damage over time.


The more you level it up, the longer duration it has and more damage it does. In short, it’s a CC ability that groups enemies together when meeting certain conditions.


Is Piranhado good?


Piranhado is one of the stronger Unique Witch Powers in Diablo 4 thanks to its ability to pull enemies in every 20 seconds if you pair the right normal Magic powers wi…]]></summary>

How to get Indira’s Memory in Diablo 4


To get Indira’s Memory in Diablo 4, you can either test your luck by playing the typical Nightmare Dungeons, Infernal Hordes, Undercity, and other modes, or you can target-farm it by defeating The Beast in the Ice.


You’ll also want to be playing on your Necromancer to ensure that this item will drop. While you can get other class items while playing different characters via the Undercity, it’s best to stick to that specific role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antistatic Studios has announced that a demo playtest of their four-player cooperative FPS, Phantom Line, is now available on PC via their Discord server. Alongside this is a new trailer to give you a peek at what you’re getting into.


It’s a bit hard to get a good read on what Phantom Line really is, so let’s start from the top. It’s a first-person shooter for 1-4 players, set in an open-world environment. You’re an operative for a megacorporation who has been dispatched into an Eastern European country following a nuclear war. Okay, sounds familiar.




However, there’s also something called the H.U.S.K. that allows you to transfer your consciousness between artificial bodies. The trailer doesn’t really capture that very well, but there’s a gif on the store page that shows it in action. Maybe.


Phantom Line promises an open world full of dynamic events. You and your friends get a derelict ship as a base of operations and can show off your loot. There’s also crafting, because an artificial army runs on its stomach, so you have to eat. The trailer shows a suspicious amount of bear violence, so you may be eating something pretty gamey.


To get in on the Phantom Line playtest, you’ll need to sign up for their discord at this link here. The full release date has yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting perks in Black Ops 6 Zombies is extremely important if you're looking to prepare for the latter rounds, and getting one for free can be immensely useful.


This method was originally discovered by @MargwaNetwork, who shared it on their X profile. The free perk can be obtained from the Ossuary Area in The Tomb, and it can be highly beneficial in the long run.


Let's take a look at how you can complete this Easter Egg in The Tomb.


How to complete the free perk Easter Egg in Black Ops 6 Zombies


Before we begin the process, you must have a player level of at least 6. You'll need the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod, and this item unlocks at level 6. If you're just a beginner, make sure to complete a couple of games quickly, and you should fit the requirements.


Once you load into the game and start a fresh round in The Tomb, try to find the Arsenal Machine. From here, you'll be able to purchase any mod you want, but make sure to get the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod. Next, keep clearing the zombies till you can reach the Ossuary region.


You'll come across six unlit lamps in the Ossuary region. They can be found on the sides of the three doorways, and they are shot at with the weapon that has the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod. Once you have shot and put all lamps on fire, you'll get a random perk for free.




The free perk will be completely random, so they might not be the best possible fit. However, it's always helpful to have any resource for free as you try to clear as many hordes of Zombies as possible.


If you're still learning the secrets of The Tomb, make sure to go through the main campaign Easter Egg guide, which will help you to get and upgrade the Ice Staff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

When No Man's Sky first launched back in 2016, we never would have thought that it'd be getting this level of support nine years on, but here we are. Hello Games has today announced the first update of 2025, 'Worlds Part II', and it looks like a big'un.
This one is a follow-up to last year's 'Worlds Part I' (who would have thought it?), once again focusing on adding an extra level of polish to the already extremely polished space adventure.

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 players might be busy with the Team of the Year promo as of writing, but the Future Stars promo is expected to be available soon in Ultimate Team.


If leaks are to be believed, Future Stars will be the next promo and the potential successor for the TOTY celebrations. Of course, Future Stars will be a returning campaign, as it was available in EA FC 24 as well. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about their plans, but certain cards have already been leaked.


All EA FC 25 Future Stars promo players (leaks)


It appears that EA Sports will be following last year's structure with the Future Stars promo. In simpler words, there will be special cards for both active footballers and former legends. The leaks, as of writing, might be limited, but some interesting names have already popped up.



Lamine Yamal


Xabi Alonso CDM 91


Lucas Beraldo


Johann Cruyff



Out of all the cards leaked so far, we have confirmation about Alonso's overall rating and potential. Details about the remaining leaks are unavailable at the time of writing. They will be updated once we have more information in the lead-up to the release.


EA FC 25 Future Stars promo release date


The TOTY cards are going to be available in packs till Friday, January 31. That's the same day the Future Stars promo is expected to go live in Ultimate Team. The new cards will be available in packs, and it's safe to expect some of the items to be made available via objectives and SBCs.


So far, we have no confirmation about whether Future Stars will be a one-week or two-week-long promo. It will also be interesting to find out if EA Sports will reintroduce the Academy Stars Evolution. Last year, we were able to upgrade six different items of our choice with massive upgrades. It will certainly be a cool addition for those who miss out on getting a TOTY item.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One that shouldn't be mist.
A few years ago, developers Adglobe and Live Wire (which, fun fact, also developed Harvestella) released a Metroidvania called Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights to high praise. Combining a heavy atmosphere with tough, Soulslike combat in a dark fantasy world, it stood out as a notably quality addition to a genre that feels like it gets at least one new entry every week. The sequel, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the mist, is a strong iteration on its predecessor's formula. It's everything a Metroidvania should be and, even if it’s not exactly revolutionary, it executes its vision well.
Ender Magnolia is set a number of years after Ender Lilies, placing you in the role of Lilac, a young girl who awakens from a long slumber in a strange and decaying world. What’s left of society is occupied by two different races: humans and the creepy machines called Homunculi. Some Homunculi could easily pass as human while others have much more monstrous or animalistic traits, and all are susceptible to corruption from a mysterious mist called fumes. Luckily, Lilac happens to be an Attuner—someone who can directly purify corrupted Homunculi—so you set out on a journey to uncover her lost memories and do what you can to set the world straight.

Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until now, we had the chance to play many RPG Roblox games inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen. However, not many of them have been successful, and for a good reason: most of them were unpolished or too rushed. Now, we have a game that might break that trend and prove to be one of the finest RPG experiences out there. So, get ready for the Jujutsu Odyssey release date with the info below.


When is The Jujutsu Odyssey Release Date?




Jujutsu Odyssey is set to release on all platforms on February 2nd at 5:30 PM CST. The developers had been relatively quiet for a long time before the official date was announced. However, they released several previews of in-game mechanics and a lot of #sneak-peeks on the official Jujutsu Odyssey Discord server. With that in mind, we believe the game can be full of content and a joy to play right from the start.


Jujutsu Odyssey Limitless Customization Trailer




Before the release, The owner of Jujutsu Odyssey, Artist 3.0, posted several previews on his official YouTube channel. We expect more previews in the following days. Still, as of writing this article, you can get a glimpse of some of the customization options and several special techniques available on release.


How to Get Early Access to the Jujutsu Odyssey?


At the moment, there hasn't been any news about early access in Jujutsu Odyssey. However, there is an ongoing invite event through which you can get permanent Tester access. Besides the access itself, the winners will also get $10,000 Robux and a Cursed Technique of their choice. The event is hosted in the #event-notice channel on the official Discord server, so make sure to check it out.


And with that, you should be ready for the upcoming release of Jujutsu Odyssey. If you want to read some more of our Roblox content, visit the Roblox section of Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a bit of musical fun involved with the new Black Ops 6 Zombies map, and you can play the song Dig by Matt Heafy at The Tomb.


To play this unique song, you'll need to find three headphones, which are located at three separate locations on the map. Once you find the third and final one, the song will start playing in the background. Let's take a look at how you can complete the Music easter egg in The Tomb.


All Black Ops 6 Music Easter Egg Headphone locations


Here are the locations of all three headphones, and it's recommended that you find them in the given order. That way, you'll save a lot of time and won't have to roam haphazardly across the map.


Headphone 1: Speed Cola Room

The first headphone is located near some skeletal remains in the Speed Cola room. In this room, you'll find the skeletal remains to your right, and the headphones will be playing music from them. You can also find a GobbleGum Machine at this location, and there are three new additions.


Headphone 2: Stamin Up Room


Image via Reddit/iconsumesnow


The second one is located in the Stamin Up room. Go inside the room and turn left, and you'll find the Stamin Up machine. You'll find a statue in this room with a ledge near it. The headphones can be found on this ledge.


Headphone 3: Portal

If you follow the main questline in The Tomb, it will take you to a glowing lotus. You'll have to interact with it to open the portal. Once you head inside the portal, you'll find a glowing plant, and the headphones will be located near it.


Once you have found the last piece, you'll hear something pretty cool playing in the background in The Tomb. If you're looking to solve more Easter Eggs in Black Ops 6 Zombies, make sure to check out this guide.

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD swung onto Switch earlier this month and it's a perfectly good time. Nothing we haven't seen before, but still a good bit of fun. That is unless you want to play some of the later stages in co-op, it seems, because fans have discovered an oversight that sucks all the fun out of platforming with your pals (thanks for the heads up, GamingReinvented).
As shared on YouTube by the wonderfully named DK fan channel, Kong Kompendium, Returns HD has a problem with its co-op combat: two players can't bounce off the same enemy. It might not sound that weird on paper (heck, Mario does it all the time), but such an ability becomes pretty crucial as you progress into the game's later stages — where bouncing on enemies is the only way to proceed — making a full co-op run on Switch far from ideal.

Thankfully, with a new report from Kotaku (thanks, Push Square) accompanying an intriguing tease from EA itself, it looks like The Sims and The Sims 2 will be re-released on PC very soon. The catch? Well, according to Kotaku's sources, it seems as though a console release is still "unclear" at the time of writing.

Playtonic Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming Yooka-Replaylee remaster, reintroducing Shovel Knight as an NPC with unique new challenges for our heroes.
The character, based on the acclaimed 2D platformer of the same name, will receive a similar new coat of paint for the updated game, and will also come with a new and improved quest line. Based on the trailer alone, it looks like this will entail climbing atop a tower before booting a bunch of Shovel Knight-themed gems (some of which – or perhaps all – turn into enemies).

One of the biggest surprises that came with Nintendo's announcement trailer for the Switch 2 was the confirmation that the company would be holding a number of global 'Nintendo Switch 2 Experience' hands-on events for members of the public following its April Direct presentation.
You were free to file your application of attendance so long as you had an active Nintendo account, but the catch was that your place would only be granted via a randomly selected draw. Yikes. So naturally, then, social media is alight at the moment with users either elated at their confirmed attendance or somewhat saddened by Nintendo's denial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a faaaaake?
The enormously popular Pokémon Trading Card Game continues to attract huge numbers of players willing to pay vast sums to catch 'em all, especially rare cards. However, some detective work by PkmnFlyingMaster on EliteForum (thanks, VGC) suggests that prototype cards from the mid-'90s which first went up for auction last year could be fakes.
First, a little background. Prior to the debut of the Pokémon Trading Card Game in Japan back in 1996, the makers printed up prototype cards during the game's development. The rarity of these pre-release 'playtest' cards makes them highly sought-after and a significant cache of them went up for sale in 2024 having been verified by card grading company CGC. CGC highlighted how they worked closely with Takumi Akabane, one of the original designers of the card game, to verify the cards' authenticity.

The Tales series is one of those JRPGs that sometimes flies under the radar. It doesn’t typically get the same hype as Final Fantasy or Persona, but Bandai Namco has been consistently putting out solid Tales games for 30 years. Tales of Graces f Remaster continues that tradition, bringing one of the best entries in this franchise to modern consoles.
As the name might imply, Tales of Graces f Remaster is a port of a port of a game that first appeared on the Wii in 2009. That version only got a release in Japan, so those of us in the West had to wait until the PS3 English-language release in 2012 (which added the 'f'). Now, more than a decade later, the remaster of that port is a game that, for good and ill, looks and feels like it is from generations ago.

Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reckon you're likely to be in one of two camps with precision platformer Bauhaus Bonk - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word "bopping" -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <updated>2025-01-23T14:00:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it's a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.

If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who've decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.
"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celeste and Towerfall creators Extremely OK Games have announced the cancellation of their pixelart exploration platformer Earthblade, in what studio director Maddy Thorson calls a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't get out. I'm trapped in a tractor full of beer and spare tires. I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

It's a rare sight to see an RTX 4090 gaming rig dip below the $3,000 mark, especially given the recent uptick in standalone GPU prices.

        <updated>2025-01-22T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.

From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered a number of seasoned BioWare developers across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

I wrote about it last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to shore up the Treehouse finances following several staff departures, I'm announcing a new line of official Maw spin-off products. Presenting: New Viscous n' Delicious Mawflakes! The ultimate cosmic breakfast cereal, available in all the colours of the rainbow plus 666 others that aren't fit for human eyes! Simply pour over molten ichor and leave to stand - you'll know they're ready to eat when you can no longer hear yourself weeping. "Ready to eat" is a phrase that cuts two ways, of course - and what better way to accompany being eaten by Mawflakes than by reading about this week's new PC games.

While I've still got a pavlovian response to anything that reminds me even a little of Capcom's sadly abandoned Dino Crisis series, the trailer below doesn't inspire all that much confidence this one will pick up the mantle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who ran an IPTV piracy operation from his home in Birmingham, UK, has been sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for fraud offenses. The case is a rare example of a seller sourcing their own content but may have been slightly overhyped. Following raids in 2021, "hundreds of thousands" were said to use the service, a figure quietly rounded down to just 2,000.

It's called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

On average, games protected by anti-tamper tech Denuvo enjoy 68 days crack-free before succumbing to piracy. Yet new research focused on MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) and video game preservation, reveals that a sample of 712 protected games, released as far back as 1979, took an average of 10.6 months each to crack. Total cracking time: 628 years.

Telefonica's cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn't expected at all.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many JRPG series, it feels as if the Tales Of series has made strides in popularity in recent years. Both 2016's Tales Of Berseria and 2021's Tales Of Arise had charming worlds and flashy combat, and the latter has found a home on our picks for the best of the genre.

Now the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blade Chimera is a cyberpunk metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind the really very good Touhou Luna Nights and Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Republican victory in the US 2024 elections, several US companies have experimented with "pivoting away" from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, a collection of employment practices aimed at challenging bias and prejudice in the workplace. Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on a journey. About an hour into Minishoot' Adventures, I was ready to call this straightforward mix of 2D shmup and 2D Zelda mediocre. My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.

Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the real best gaming handheld of 2025, the Steam Deck.
I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the Steam Deck OLED, that one’s better.

I don't know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.
