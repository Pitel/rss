The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hasn't even been available for a week yet and already players are crafting some absolutely mind-blowing creations with the new toolkit in the game.

Stranger of Paradise was a very different lens into the world of Final Fantasy than we're accustomed to. Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo partnered with Square Enix to reimagine the story of the first Final Fantasy, creating a lovably irreverent protagonist with Jack Garland in the process.
It was, by all accounts, a solid vision of an action-driven, alternative take on Final Fantasy's origins. The team continued to build on it over time, with more downloadable content and jobs, adding some classic pieces of Final Fantasy mythos in the process.
With the recent release of the Steam version, we got a chance to catch up with director Daisuke Inoue and ask some burning lingering questions about Stranger of Paradise, now a little over a year since its launch. We've previously tal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In California, Sizzle Season is more commonly known as "The State is on Fire" Season
I'm not sure what happened between me and Splatoon, but spare time to play the game seemed to evaporate for me once the series made the move to Nintendo Switch. I still adore everything about this series. I just have a tough time making space in my schedule for it. Hopefully, I can find a way to turn that around with the start of Sizzle Season. This morning, Nintendo dropped a fresh trailer for the game detailing everything players will experience in the new season, including a new gun modeled after the Super Scope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mLdx4sVKw
Something tells me that Super Scope will get a lot more play than the actual one. As you saw in the trailer, a fan-style paintbrush is also being added to Splatoon 3 with the Sizzle Season as well as the wonderfully named Barnacle & Dime stage, rendered as one incredibly opulent mall. Kudos to the translators who decided the best way to connect with the kids today is to name the stage after a line of stores that haven't been relevant for 30 years.
In addition to the new stage and weapons, the Sizzle Season will also introduce Jammin' Salmon Junction for Salmon Run, new clothes, new cards, and new challenges like Too Many Trizookas.
That sounds like a pretty solid season if you ask me. While I still need to play through the story of Splatoon 2, I should probably dedicate at least some of my time each week to the multiplayer of Splatoon 3. If only so I don't miss out on some sick-as-hell threads.
Sizzle Season starts in Splatoon 3 on June 1, 2023.

Blizzard is changing its plans for the long-awaited Overwatch 2 PvE mode. In a developer update today, the company confirms that it's scrapping its original plans for the mode, pivoting its PvE side into the seasonal content structure of the game.
Back in 2019, Blizzard Entertainment officially unveiled Overwatch 2, a follow-up to its 2016 hero shooter. Alongside updates to the PvP multiplayer side, there was a PvE mode shown off. Players would choose a hero, squad up, and tackle missions where they could level up talents and maintain some level of long-term progress.
This mode felt like a big reason for the "2" in Overwatch 2, but it eventually fell by the wayside. Overwatch 2 launched last year without its new PvE mode, and the q…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.
Season 5, which has the theme of "Mischief and Magic," is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.
Season 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.
Finally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.
Overwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.]]></summary>

Xbox appears to be sitting pretty in the UK, at least according to new data released by the chart-building analyst Gfk, which notes that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S platforms have now surpassed two million sales within Blighty's borders.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the two million milestone was achieved in 128 weeks from launch, which makes the Gen9 platform the eighth fastest-selling console in UK history. Surprisingly, (or perhaps not, depending on your perspective), Xbox hit this mark even faster than the Nintendo Switch, which took 140 weeks to shift two million units to British customers.
The cozy black box did not, however, beat the precedent set by Microsoft's own Xbox One, which sold the same amount of units in just 104 weeks. Of course, the Xbox One launch did not have to face the same obstacles presented to the Xbox Series X/S launch, including COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages. For the sake of interest, the console that reached two million UK sales in the quickest time is, of course, Nintendo Wii, which reached the target in a mere 57 weeks during 2006-2007.
The remainder of the Top Five is rounded out with PlayStation hardware.

They're also hugely expensive, normally costing close to $1000, but a deep discount on their Z690 model over at Newegg brings it to $400. That's still pricey, but a reasonable pickup given the feature list for anyone designing a top-end gaming rig around Intel's 12th-gen or 13th-gen Core processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror Almost Unreal (5)
Bloober Team has revealed the launch date for its long-in-development release, Layers of Fear — The highly technical psychological horror title will launch on PC and Gen9 platforms on June 15, with a time-limited demo available to play on PC from now until May 22.
Built in Unreal 5 for MAXIMUM TERROR, Layers of Fear is a remade compendium of both Layers of Fear (2016) and Layers of Fear 2 (2019), along with all previously released DLC and a brand new concluding chapter, titled The Writer. Developer Anshar Studios is hoping that the incredible technical acumen of Unreal 5 will allow for a truly immersive and unsettling experience, as players pick their way through a shifting environment — trapped, lost, and attacked by no less than the twisted mind of the self.
"We are thrilled to announce the release date for Layers of Fear and to bring this definitive horror experience to players," writes Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno. "With the power of Unreal Engine 5, we’ve been able to create a game that visually surpasses our previous works, delivering an unforgettable journey into the minds of tormented artists. We are excited for both new and returning players to jump in."

Bloober Team also released the PC requirements, which you can check out above.
The demo will give fans an opportunity to check that their rig is up to handling the high visual standards of this new edition, which utilizes 4K resolution, HDR, and Ray-Tracing, while also enhancing its lighting, reflection, and particle techniques with some of the most modern graphics tools available. Dedicated Layers of Fear fans will be able to enjoy new mechanics and twists on the original gameplay, while newcomers can experience the entire story of both titles and their DLC expansions seamlessly branched together.
It's too scary for me, is what I'm basically saying.
Layers of Fear launches June 15 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Despite having been counting down the days until The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's release over the past four years or more, nothing could have prepared me for the game's opening. Confident, eerie, cinematic. It does everything that a Zelda opening should do, but in a way that no other game in the series has. Sure, there may be a certain amount of recency bias at play here, but this might just be the series' — if not Nintendo's — best opener of all time and I can't stop thinking about it.

It was back in 2021 that we first heard about developer Nihon Falcom's plans to bring 2012's Japan-only action RPG The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails to Switch, and we have today found out that the game will be officially heading our way on 19th September.
There is a fresh story trailer for the game (found above) which itself is a spin-off from Falcom's 'Trials' series. That's right, alongside the localisation of Trails to Azure back in March and the planned release of Trails into Reverie in July, this game will be the third in the series that we get in the course of this year — pretty good going if you ask us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's 'delayed' to you and I
Skybound Games and developer Mega Cat Studios has announced that the colorful pro-wrestling RPG WrestleQuest will no longer meet its May release window and will now step into the ring sometime this summer.
In a shoot-worked promo posted to Twitter, Mega Cat Studios spoke of its excitement with the title so far, but notes that a recently secured "partnership" has forced the studio to push back the title's launch. This seems to suggest that the delay is a positive one, and will allow the studio to implement whatever benefits the new partnership has allowed for. Mega Cat notes that it expects to announce a new release before May is done and dusted.
https://twitter.com/megacatstudios/status/1658095888227770370?s=20
"While we are disappointed that we couldn’t share the entirety of WrestleQuest with you sooner like we hoped," concludes the studio, "we firmly believe this is the right choice with respect to our players and the sweat, sweat, and more sweat we have poured into building the best game we have ever made. We can’t wait to get your hands on it!"
WrestleQuest, as we have previously reported, combines the wild spectacle of golden age wrestling with the stat-based strategy of turn-based RPGs. Players will guide custom superstars through the territory system of the 1980s, aided or hindered by a roster of over 30 real-world wrestlers including “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant. Jeff Jarrett is also in the mix, because he can't stay out of fucking anything.
WrestleQuest is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been meaning to write about Veiled Experts for over a month now, since playing it religiously during the Final Beta Test. I've been putting it off mostly because I've been busy, but also because I'm trying to find a way of saying "actually it's really good" without people laughing and throwing garbage at me. It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said "third person Counter-Strike", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: "sounds awful".
Thank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.

Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.
Developed by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.

If you're a fan of the utterly fantastic Robert Eggers movie The Lighthouse, then this upcoming first-person horror might well be up your street.
No One Lives Under the Lighthouse is a slow-burn horror in which you take on the role of a lighthouse keeper, tasked with keeping the lights on every night. Hallucinations might cause your sanity to slip as you explore the creepy PS1-inspired environments.

The game previously changed its name earlier in the year, dropping the pluralisation of Layers Of Fears. Presumably, it'll still explore more than one fear, though. You can see for yourself as the game released a new demo today, available on Steam until May 22nd.

On any given month when there's a massive first-party value offer for a service like Xbox Game Pass, you can bet on the rest of the month quaking in fear of the might of the publisher that holds all the power. But in the case of Redfall (particularly when it comes to public perception), this might have been a not-great month to flex.
The offerings for May 2023 (so far) are fairly slim, outside of the fantastic Chicory: A Colorful Tale, which won our overall Game of the Year award in 2021. Maybe Massive Chalice is worth a punt since you're not spending any extra money on it? Or maybe you're deathly curious about how FIFA is coming along this decade. There's a fair bit of hype regarding Cassette Beasts, which came out in April and has had a great reception so far.
Either way, this is what you're getting this month beyond Redfall. Peaks and valleys, folks!

Heading to Xbox Game Pass the week of May 15:
FIFA 23, May 16 (Console and PC)
Eastern Exorcist, May 18 (Console and PC)
Ghostlore, May 18 (Console)
Heading to Xbox Game Pass the week of May 122:
Planet of Lana, May 23 (Console and PC)
Cassette Beasts, May 25 (Console)
Massive Chalice, May 25 (Cloud and Console)
Railway Empire 2, May 25 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Heading to Xbox Game Pass the week of May 29:
Chicory: A Colorful Tale, May 30 (Console and PC)

It's no secret that Tales of Symphonia Remastered launched in a, shall we say, less-than-favourable state. With the release retaining many of the annoyances from the original GameCube title (along with adding a few new ones to boot), it sadly wound up being a rather forgettable experience.
Thankfully, Bandai Namco is back with another update, introducing a number of much-needed fixes that should make for a more enjoyable experience for players.

Music is a definitely big part of these games, but Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical has set itself on a different kind of musical path, in that it’s actually a musical. I'm talking like a full-on ballad-belter, curtain-caller, exit-stage-left-er musical. And get this: it’s also a modern retelling of the mythos behind the Greek Gods. It feels like my inner theatre kid has chugged ten Red Bulls and is waiting for her cue to burst out.

This new venture, at the very least, has something of a physical form.
The Assassin's Creed Smart Collectibles line consists of images of characters from the long-running stealth series, replicated as "Digital Souls". The variance in these images will be implemented via the costumes and equipment each Soul will be wearing and carrying.

Nintendo has really gone all out with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. With the new Ultrahand and Fuse mechanics, the world is your oyster. Anything you can possibly think of, you can probably either build with Ultrahand or stick together with Fuse; the possibilities are seemingly limitless.
Indeed, one player has discovered a rather novel way to travel the land of Hyrule, and it's not even remotely difficult to achieve, either. As you'll no doubt already know from Breath of the Wild, you can use your shield as a kind of makeshift snowboard, allowing you to surf down slopes with ease.

Annapurna's sci-fi kitty adventure Stray is seemingly headed to the Xbox platform, at least according to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), which has uploaded a listing for a new port the award-winning dystopian tale, currently available on PlayStation and PC platforms.
First spotted by Twitter user MACOS380, (and reported thereafter by VGC), the ESRB rating all but confirms that the interesting and unique release will be headed to Xbox One and Xbox Series X at some point in the near future, bringing the futuristic feline's adventures to a wider audience. Annapurna Interactive is yet to announce an Xbox port of Stray, but the revelation of the rating may mean that one is imminent.
https://twitter.com/MACOS380/status/1658387346520145924?s=20
Released in the summer of 2022, Stray, sees the player guide an inquisitive kitty through a miserable walled city, devastated by an A.I. run amok and abandoned by all human citizens. Utilizing deft movement, adaptation, and ingenuity, the moggy embarks upon a quest to reach the surface of the city, aided by a robot drone, B-12, and threatened by the city's security droids and a mysterious, sentient bacteria known as "Zurk". Stray was praised on release for its world-building, animation, and uniqueness, as well as its ability to tell a deep and complex tale through minimal dialogue.
Stray is available right meow on PlayStation and PC platforms.
An Xbox version of Stray has been rated by the ESRB [VGC]

Yes, the single white handle is a slightly rogue design choice, but it's difficult to argue with just how sweet that gold detailing looks.
Getting one of these bad boys has quickly become a pretty big deal, but there have been reports from some customers that the much sought-after controller is experiencing drift right out of the box.

"Ever since launch, we have been on a journey to excite and delight our players, however, while we have an amazing and very engaged community, we haven’t been able to reach the critical mass needed to sustain development. This has led us to the decision to stop further development of Bloodhunt."

Roughly summarized, here are the conclusions the European Commission came to as a result of their investigations:

One fair criticism we can throw at Metal Gear Solid 3 is that most of its bosses went from being characters to just obstacles, but one thing we just can't say is that those obstacles weren't fun to destroy.
MGS3 features some of the most inventive and fun boss battles in the history of gaming, and it's high time that we pay our respects to these deadly and dramatic foes.

At the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What colors are the other fingers?
Kohachi Studio has given us a teaser look at Black Finger Jet, a new run-and-gun title from former prominent Nazca developers. Nazca is the original developer behind Metal Slug, and a number of the attached names were directly involved in the development of some of the early titles in that series.
No real gameplay is shown in the trailer, as the game looks to be very early in development. There’s a page for it live on Steam, but even there, it just shows concept art and says that the game is still subject to change. However, both the teaser and the store page seem to heavily imply that Black Finger Jet will be lifting heavily from the team’s work on the Metal Slug series. It will include 8-directional aiming, and the eponymous Jet vehicle transforms into various configurations.
https://youtu.be/ZIEwNh5ZLI4
Among the staff, Akio is covering art, and Meeher is the producer. Sound design is once again in the hands of Hiya! This probably all sounds unhinged, but all of those pseudonyms helped make the original Metal Slug run the games they are. Hopefully, they can pull of similar magic with Black Finger Jet.
Hea-vy Machine Gun
If you’re unfamiliar with Metal Slug, I pity you. Starting in 1996 on the Neo Geo MVS arcade, they set the highwater mark for both pixel art and run-and-gun shooters. Nazca (and the staff listed above) worked on Metal Slug 1-3, before SNK went bust and development moved to another team. That team made a valiant effort to continue the series for three more titles, and they didn’t do a bad job. However, for my money, Metal Slug 1 and X are where it’s at. Others hold Metal Slug 3 in the highest regard. However you shake them; they are legendary.
Black Finger Jet is currently only announced for PC. There is no given release window, but since it seems like they’re still recruiting staff, we might be waiting a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor developers Respawn Entertainment have been busy on patch duty, pumping out a series of updates aimed at addressing the torrid state of its PC performance at launch. The newest, last week’s Patch 4, sounded particularly enthusiastic about tackling Jedi: Survivor’s technical troubles, so now would be a fine time to check in on the progress of this fixing-upping campaign.


A few droid decapitatin’ benchmark runs later, I can say that Patch 4 (and its predecessors) have made meaningful improvements to ray tracing performance, and that there's a lot less stuttering than there was at launch - even if this hasn’t been smoothed out entirely. General performance, however, remains deeply underwhelming, with powerful GPUs still unable to achieve a bulletproof 60fps even at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's another delay but at least it's short
The upcoming horror game Amnesia The Bunker has bee delayed once again. In a social media video Friday, the game's creative lead Fredrik Olsson confirmed that the title will now release on June 6. It's just two weeks, but this comes only days before its initial release time on May 16. Olsson explained the reason why there's an Amnesia The Bunker delay.
Rare crashes plague Amnesia The Bunker
As Amnesia The Bunker has been going through the certification process, Olsson claimed on Twitter that they've found "multiple, rare crashes that are very difficult to identify, reproduce, and thereby also fix." Olsson notes that they could've had the team work during weekends to make the release date, but he said that is not something they choose to do at the studio.
"Everything's coming together so nicely," Olsson said to fans. "We have the gameplay, the art, the animations, the atmosphere, the narrative, everything is coming together, and we are really ready to ship this out to the world."
https://youtu.be/jvUV3Hh6b0g
Amnesia The Bunker's original release window was March 2023. The first delay pushed it to May 16, but with this announcement, the horror title will now creep into fans' homes on June 6. When it does arrive, players will be taken through a haunted bunker from World War 1. You're playing as a soldier that's been cut off from his battalion and has to face this creepy environment alone.
Olsson also confirmed that an Amnesia The Bunker demo will be released on Steam. No official demo release date is out, but the creative lead did say to keep an eye out for the timing.
Hopefully, this Amnesia The Bunker delay will be the last as it approaches its release on June 6. It will be released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. This may give you enough time to finish the Resident Evil 4 remake (or replay it on another difficulty).

We have known for a good while now that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild (heck, we all called it 'Breath of the Wild 2' for long enough) and this means that there are, of course, a boatload of references to the former games. One that we have caught today, however, is a little more heartwarming than most (thanks, VG247).
Let's clear this up first: we are going to be mentioning certain Tears of the Kingdom plot points here as well as the events of the Champions' Ballad DLC for BOTW. That means that we are adventuring into spoiler territory with this one, so if you are keen to avoid details for either of the above, then do not read past the following picture of Daruk.

The European Commission have today approved the $70 billion acquisition, saying that Microsoft’s commitments “represent a significant improvement for cloud gaming.” That’s a markedly different tone to the UK’s conclusion last month, as the British regulator blocked the acquisition over concerns about the cloud market’s future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.
Patricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.
Patricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.
If you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.
Those numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.
In the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.
Running out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.
Once Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can "make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule."
Ranked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.
Ranked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and "other factors" Epic has yet to specify.
Will you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Universal has announced that its billion-dollar blockbuster The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be officially available for purchase in the U.S. via the company's streaming service, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, from tomorrow, May 16. It will retail for $29.99, or rentals are also available.
That's a lot of Golden Coins.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which premiered in theaters on April 5 of this year, has been a staggering success — already surpassing a $1 billion box office to become the most successful cinematic release of the year so far, beating out offerings from the Marvel and DC Cinematic Universes. The Super Mario Bros. Movie joins a very small circle of films to have broken the billion-dollar barrier since the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to be the highest-grossing film of 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-uw1ZmIi7o
Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the Illumination-produced movie sees the iconic Nintendo mascot and his friends face off against the nefarious Bowser and his army of familiar ne'er-do-wells. While critics have been fairly divisive of the film, clearly audiences were ready to just return to theaters amidst a wave of color, noise, and silliness. The success of the film is expected to lead to further collaborations between Nintendo and Illumination in the future, with either studio tentatively suggesting that they have been both impressed and inspired by the film's incredible release.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is still in theaters worldwide, and can be rented or purchased in the U.S. via the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment service tomorrow, May 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. 
Mouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.
The game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. 


Mouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1962 - 2023
This morning has shone a sad light on the news that voice actor Brendan O'Brien passed away earlier this year at the age of 60 — The American performer had starred in several films, TV shows, and video games, but will be best known to video game fans as the original voice of PlayStation platforming hero, Crash Bandicoot.
O'Brien's passing happened back on March 23, but this evaded public notice until this past weekend, when game developer Tony Grayson reported the news on Twitter. A eulogy was also added to the Legacy website last week, which speaks of O'Brien's adoption of acting at a very early age, as well as his musical expertise, and his love of nature and exploration, shared with his wife, Ingrid.
In the video game sphere, O'Brien performed the array of wild and madcap sounds that Crash makes as he barrels his way through the Wumpa Islands, offering the zany hero personality through chaotic screams and yells, as well as the memetic "Whoa" that is still intrinsically linked with the series and its characters to this day. O'Brien would voice Crash and other characters, including Tiny Tiger, Dr. N. Gin, and Dr. Nitrus Brio in earlier Crash titles including Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, CTR: Crash Team Racing, and Crash Bash.
A fascinating element of O'Brien's legacy lies in the fact that, while he never really delivered any actual dialogue as Crash Bandicoot, he infused the personality and character that would lead to the platform hero becoming a huge success, during an era when many such characters would be left by the wayside. And while O'Brien would eventually leave the character in his past, he helped the franchise — one that shape the formative years of so many players — find the heart and success that endures today.
We at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.

You know, the sort of games where you're let loose on some open turf, perhaps with an objective, perhaps not, but always with an eye to see what's over yonder. There are some exceptions to the rule, but we reckon they're justified because some worlds are too special to discount. So, join us as we've put together our list of the 10 best open world games to play in 2023.

If you haven't been playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom over the weekend, then a brief look at any social media service this morning should catch you up. We've seen weird and wonderful builds, interesting solutions and some really, really creative art. So wonderful has this art been, in fact, that we felt it was only right to share some of it with you lovely lot, bringing us neatly onto this stunning hand-drawn journal by artist and game developer @stepickford.
Formally of Rare and Software Creations, Pickford worked on several titles for the NES and SNES such as Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II and Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball. The dev has since proven his artists' touch in different ways — you might remember Pickford's Elden Ring journal from last year, recording his game playthrough with wonderful inky sketches to mark his progress. Now, he is doing the same for Tears of the Kingdom, and after a weekend of playing, we can see how the project is going so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only that pesky Wii Fit board lies in its path
Last week, Nintendo finally launched its long-awaited Switch sequel The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — And while Nintendo typically tends to keep its cards close to its chest regarding game sales, the numbers crunchers operating the UK Charts have already released some impressive stats.
As curated by Gfk, (and reported by GamesIndustry.biz), Tears of the Kingdom saw the second biggest Nintendo launch ever in the UK — that's including all week one sales figures for all Wii, Game Boy, and SNES releases. Regarding revenue, the sky-high sequel is beaten out only by the 2007 exerciser Wii Fit, due to the expanded price of the Wii Fit Board peripheral. In terms of units sold, Tears of the Kingdom sits in fourth place after Wii Fit, and the combined sales taken from sibling Pokemon titles, such as Pokemon Sun & Moon or Pokemon Sword & Shield.

Essentially, when viewed from a non-peripheral, non-double-pack standpoint, Tears of the Kingdom essentially had the biggest UK launch in Nintendo history — And that's just referencing physical sales in one territory. When you factor in the success that was no doubt seen across th weekend in Japan and North America, then Tears of the Kingdom looks set to be an absolute all-timer for Nintendo, definitely resting in the premier league of the company's sales charts.
This is emphasized by industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who suggests that Nintendo's latest could find itself lingering in the sales charts "for years", much like its Switch sibling Mario Kart 8.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.

Bandai Namco has unveiled the next veteran warrior returning for the studio's upcoming fighter Tekken 8 — And returning to The King of Iron Fist Tournament is the hard-kickin', hard-riding taekwondo expert Hwoarang!
Hailing from South Korea and making his debut in 1997's Tekken 3, Hwoarang was initially established as a major player, set to be the Ken to Jin Kazama's Ryu and the successor of the aging Baek Doo San. Hwoarang, though disciplined in his martial arts studies, is generally depicted as a smart-mouthed, bad-boy biker, though he has shown loyalty, courage, and dedication to both his craft and to his friends and peers.

The game is a prehistoric take on Stardew Valley’s crop-growing, dungeon-exploring, people-romancing formula. Its PAX East demo caught our eye earlier this year, and the full release late last month charmed many fans on Steam for the short time it was available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wile E. Coyote heads to Hyrule
We're now three days into The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which has certainly seen a lot of players dive into the latest Hyrule adventure. A big part of this new entry is construction: being able to build and break things in equal measure thanks to the Ultrahand power.
Unsurprisingly, everyone has built some weird, weird stuff with it. Cars and planes seem almost banal compared to what I've seen. Take, for example, Giant With a Rocket Appendage. You can guess which appendage has the flames.
https://twitter.com/ZAKUYA_BOTW/status/1657265674400706560
The experiments are not limited to Link alone, either. The new backpack-addled Koroks have become crash test dummies for the courageous hero's harebrained inventions.
https://twitter.com/sarahpodz/status/1657107025791156225
Even in shrines, I find myself not settling for functional, but aiming for the absurd. There's a slapstick comedy vibe to all the physics-driven possibilities in this space, and it's supremely enjoyable to smash these systems up against each other.
As Tears of the Kingdom goes on, and I continue to unlock more and more Zonai tools, the possibilities feel endless. At first, a simple car was a surprise. But after building flame-spewing trucks and laser-blasting roombas, it feels like there's a world of design and invention waiting out there in Hyrule.
So, to the Destructoid community, I ask: what's the weirdest thing you've made so far? Share your inventions, successful or not, in the comments below and help spur on the general imagination. I'm hoping to find some sparks of inspiration for my next Korok delivery system.

For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible.

My favorite moment in the Zelda franchise, without question, is when Link picks up Marin like an item in Link’s Awakening. No matter how many times I see it, the “do-do-do-doooooo” and flavor text describing Marin always gets a laugh out of me.
It’s the type of meta-joke that I could see a cheeky indie developer making in 2010. Except this is an official Nintendo Zelda game from 1993. Honestly, this may be the first joke I ever laughed at in a video game. Like everything in Link’s Awakening, this moment is whimsical, silly, yet strangely poignant. It’s scenes like these that make Link’s Awakening my favorite Zelda game ever made.
Yet what if I told you that this scene was more than a good laugh? That its meaning extends far beyond the bounds of Link’s Awakening a…]]></summary>

It's not often that we get an insight into a sequel's storyline before it releases. Thankfully, we have the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 prequel comic written by Christos Gage with art by Ig Guara.

As the prophecy has foretold, evil will rise, time and time again, and a hero will show up to make it stop. Their job would be a lot easier if there wasn’t also a third person in the prophecy who, time and time again, makes everything worse.
Princess Zelda is one of the most vexing supporting characters in video game history. Being type-cast is bad enough, but when the narrative actually does have her in a more prominent role, it's almost always her duty to screw up and make the problem bigger. She's there simply to give Link more problems to solve. The Legend of Zelda may have her name in the title, but the series would be a lot better off completely rethinking the character or simply dropping her completely.

Up to 40% of a game's total sales occur in the first month, according to the SSRN Electronic Journal. Consequently, the best strategy for studios is to ensure their titles launch with a bang. Some strategic marketing is necessary to achieve this. Piling up good reviews from critics and gamers is also vital, meaning it's essential for games to launch in a polished state.
Over the years, a few titles have missed the mark terribly, resulting in catastrophic launches. The following list contains some of the worst offenders in gaming history.

Something a bit special from the retro funsters of Hamster this week, as Banpresto's coin-op adaptation of the much-loved manga/anime series Mazinger Z has joined the Arcade Archives, and is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the Japanese arcade market in 1994, the vertically scrolling shmup is an adaptation of Go Nagai's iconic mecha franchise, which spawned numerous manga, anime, and theatrical films. Players choose from one of three vessels — Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, or Grendizer — before embarking on a mission to defeat the endless forces of The Mechanical Beasts, Mycenae Forces, and The Vegan Empire, which have combined their powers in a joint plan to conquer the world. What follows is eight stages of frenetic arcade action, as the Mazinger forces battle the three factions and the mastermind, Dr. Hell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ1EgpzTEjU&ab_channel=HAMSTERCorporation
While the arrival of Mazinger Z is very much a welcome one, it comes at something of a price, quite literally. In order to secure the license to release Mazinger Z, Hamster was pressed to roll out extra Yen to the license holders. The publisher is looking to pass this cost on to the player, as Mazinger Z will retail for twice the price of all Arcade Archives entries. This is the first time that Hamster has had to pay the additional licensing fee, which suggests that any future re-releases based on popular and lucrative brands might also see a lift in their retail costs.
It's rough, especially given that many Arcade Archives releases are already a little princely for their longevity, but for Mazinger fans, the extra buckeroos will probably be seen as a bill worth footing.
Mazinger Z is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch priced at around $15.

While performance is good, at up to 550MB/s for reads and a little less for writes, the real benefit here is having up to 8TB of silent, reliable and low latency storage. 
You can currently pick up this RPS-recommended gaming SSD in its ultimate 8TB form for less than £415 from two places in the UK: Tech Next Day, where you can use code TND-10 to get it for £414, and Amazon, where you can get the drive for £412. I've included both options in case you have a preference, and in the event the drive goes out of stock at this reduced price by the time you come to click the links below!

Today, the RX 6950 XT has dropped below the £600 mark for the first time we're aware of, with a chunky triple-fan ASRock model costing just £598 at Overclockers in the UK. That's significantly cheaper than the £999 that these cards originally debuted at, bringing it into contention with newer-gen cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo has released a new Amiibo to commemorate the game. The figure, seen above looks great. You can really imagine Link reaching into a grocery store freezer to grab his favorite obscure ice cream flavor hidden behind all the unsold cartons of strawberry. But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?
Sometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears. I think the flames licking Link's dead body would look great in translucent red plastic.
I would love an Amiibo of this moment where another…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mech Punk is taking the piss, and I like it. Deliberately opaque games are one thing. Artsy games making a point (that seldom grab me, I shouldn't admit) are another. But Mech Punk is something else altogether, and an incredibly rare game that actually earns the "punk" in its title.
Does that mean it's good? Well, umm. Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to "Alan Smithee". I don’t think they’re disowning it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. 
But speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games "weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in," he says.

But while we may never get to play a mainline Zelda game on PC, there's no denying it's inspired countless other developers to have a stab at it themselves, hence why we've put together this list of the best PC games like Zelda you can play right now. Whether you're looking to scratch that Tears Of The Kingdom itch or get stuck into something more retro-facing like A Link To The Past, we've got you covered. These are the best Zelda-likes on PC we'd recommend playing today.

This Mini ITX case is one of the most popular options, thanks to its excellent value, thoughtful design and easy build process - and I can say that with some authority, having bought two myself.

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.
It's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after. You'll definitely see that in the results below, as I had to scan some Amiibo figures several times b…]]></summary>

But why spend money on a new game when you have perfectly good versions of the same experience broken up across multiple completely different games right now? That’s right, you can enjoy all of Tears of the Kingdom’s signature mechanics – Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall – without dropping $70 bucks (or its future sale price of $68.75). All you have to do is dig up a few games, kick your imagination into overdrive, and ignore everyone talking about how great Zelda is to enjoy an approximation of the Link’s latest adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tribeca Film Festival has announced its official selection of video games nominated for the Tribeca Games Award. 
This is only the third year that games have been recognized at the annual film festival. The event highlights upcoming titles, which have generally been smaller budget/indie works, that have “potential for excellence in art and storytelling through design, artistic mastery, and highly immersive worlds.” The previous Tribeca Games Award winners are Norco in 2021 and Thirsty Suitors in 2022. 
Here is the 2023 selection, which will be spotlighted with new trailers and developer interviews on the big night:
Chants of Sennaar
Despelote
The Expanse: A Telltale Series
Goodbye Volcano High
A Highland Song
Nightscape
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical
Additionally, the festival will screen a new documentary called Hideo Kojima - Connecting Worlds. The film delves into the mind and creative process of the man behind Metal Gear and Death Stranding and features appearances from Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus, Grimes, Chvrches, and others. 
The Tribeca Film Festival runs from June 7-18, but the Games showcase airs on June 9. The Tribeca Game Awards is just one of the many video game showcases airing in June, and you can keep up with all of them by visiting our handy event schedule.]]></summary>

It's why I love the model of Imperialism, where everywhere is one turn, no shuffling away. It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics. But after finally making time for it, I've realised that most of them, even some of the "logi" focused players, don't know what that actually means.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is battling impossible expectations. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild represented a radical and successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda – a series considered by many to be the apex of game design. Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.
To give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect. The resulting game lacks the admittedly difficult-to-recreate, undeniable impact and newness …]]></summary>

Developer Netherrealm have been dropping small teasers that potentially point toward a series reboot, or a timeline cleanse, or a return to the series' past. Hey, the next instalment might not even be named MK12. Watch last night’s very brief teaser below:

I’ve had a blast beating up supernatural weirdos with a group of misfit college teens. Together with its soundtrack of absolute bangers that combines dramatic church choir chorus with pulsing synth wave beats (please put the OST on Spotify, Ysbryd), and a slick art style that makes me dribble like a brain-hungry zombie every time I see it, I’m thinking that Demonschool might very well be on its way to being be one of my favourite games of 2023 when it releases sometime this year. What can I say? I love punching freaky demons in the face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

The story follows Mimi, a young woman who returns to her departed grandmother’s countryside cottage in the real-life French region of Dordogne to uncover family secrets. Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion.

The patch goes live today and introduces different improvements depending on the platform. Requiem on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S gets a performance mode that lets players run the game at 60 FPS in exchange for a lower resolution. 
Meanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.
We enjoyed A Plague Tale: Requiem, with editor Wesley LeBlanc scoring the game an 8 out of 10 in his review, which you can read here. Will you be trying out these new graphics options? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

Details are scarce, but the pair are working on a brand new action-adventure IP codenamed Project Bloom. We’ve been teased with a single piece of concept art that shows off a brooding character dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, contemplating something in a very dreamy forest.

The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games. 
Are you excited for Silksong? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and developer Guerrilla have revealed that the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32 million units sold. 
The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next." 
For more about the series, read Game Informer's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West reviews. Then read what we thought of Horizon Call of the Mountain and the recent Burning Shores expansion.

One Redditor has thankfully recreated a functional version of the translator and this clip shows the delightfully faithful tool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.
Just like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, "hella broken," and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>

Redfall is my biggest disappointment of 2023. As a massive fan of developer Arkane Studios’ previous work, from Dishonored through Deathloop, my expectations were high for the company’s new release. However, this vampire-hunting first-person shooter is messy, plagued with technical flaws and head-scratching design decisions counterintuitive to the game itself. The result is an often-bland experience, made frustrating by occasional glimpses of potential, and it’s sucked the life out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. 


What I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, fans will finally get their first look at Payday 3's gamplay, according to a new teaser trailer.
This teaser is the latest following a similarly brief trailer released in January. Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.


Payday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.

Darkest Dungeon II is cruel. A simple miscalculation or bad luck can ruin your two-to-three-hour expedition before the chapter’s final boss. There are no checkpoints; if your party dies, it’s time to start fresh from the very beginning. Only some unlocked upgrades stay with you. When you have to make tough choices all the time while keeping in mind various systems, this can (and will) be frustrating and nerve-racking. At the same time, Darkest Dungeon II is the most cathartic and rewarding experience since the original in 2016.
Much like its predecessor, you create a party of four distinct heroe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month Rachel made us aware of a life sim called Grave Seasons, a kind of mash up of perennial favourite Stardew Valley and, er, the half-season serial killer arc of a police procedural TV show. Naturally this turned my head, like Tarantino walking past a ladies shoe store, and I emailed the developers Perfect Garbage to find out a bit more. They describe the game as "fun, campy and spooky" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed. Appropriate for a game where, every time you start a new run, one of the townsfolk starts killing everyone else.

When motivation is directly linked to restrictions perceived as unnecessary or unfair, that can lead to moral justification. That's understandable in some cases, but when a company like Nintendo counters by targeting a tool like Lockpick, that's not surprising; it's inevitable.

Previously it's only been available as a download from its own website, but now Wizards say it'll come to Steam on May 23rd.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last week and a bit, we've been steadily releasing a bunch of stories from our big, hour-long chat with XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon that took place at this year's GDC. It was a wide-ranging interview, looking at what Solomon plans to do next now that he's left Firaxis, and how he feels about his 20+ year career there. You can read the condensed version of that interview here, but as a treat for RPS supporters, I thought you might like to read our chat in full. There's still a lot I couldn't quite squeeze into separate news stories here, and I think (and hope) you'll find it interesting to read as a whole. So here it is. All 8760-odd words of it. Enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aeons ago, I wrote about the Leftfield collection that was supposed to happen at Rezzed 2020. Ploughing through several emotions without comment, in amongst the games that we never got to see as a result of Things Happening was an earlier version of Lunark, a clearly Flashback-influenced action puzzle platformer.
I've kind of worried about it ever since, so I was glad to see it released recently, and gladder still that it's a lot of fun.

It's an interesting idea and quite a silly game, with a daft tone and some cheery ultraviolence.

Shortly before release, Valve bestowed it with Verified status for the Steam Deck, a coveted green tick that represents more or less complete compatibility and suitability for the portable PC. 
I wouldn’t normally curl an eyebrow at this sort of thing – having more great Steam Deck games is good for PC gaming – but given how all-over-the-shop Redfall’s performance is on desktop PCs, could it really settle in on the less powerful Deck? A few ambulatory vamp slaying jaunts later, I can conclude that it... maaaaaybe can. Sort of.

Flashes of Arkane's brilliance make an appearance, but they are a rare find amidst a bland, incoherent world that clearly points to deeper issues in a game that's been drained of its magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.

“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take one look at Luna Abyss and you'll probably go, 'Wait a minute, this looks like first-person Returnal!' And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. 
There's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.

Not only have we got upcoming games Life By You and Paralives offering more customisation options, more features, and more polish than The Sims, but now there's Tiny Life as well, a new entrant that asks the question: what if The Sims was simply smaller? Tiny Life has just released into early access, and it’s aiming to scratch that Sim-itch in a leaner, pixelated package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is not a good game. I don’t think you need me to pour salt on that wound if you’ve spent significant time with it. But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>

On May 23, players can embark on an adventure as Lana, joined by her cat-like companion, Mui, to rescue her sister. The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below. 


Planet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay. The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you're looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn't say exactly when. 


In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Marvel's Spider-Man and then read our thoughts on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

That's because on Free Comic Book day, which is this Saturday on May 6, PlayStation will release a prequel comic book for Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Midnight Suns hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2, 2022, with plans for the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions to launch at a later date. Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game's fourth and final DLC – Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero – releases. 
As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn't provide anything more than, "Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel's Midnight Suns is no longer planned." This follows news from earlier this year that the game's director (and the director of Firaxis' modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. 
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game's Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it's begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. 
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that "Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. 
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first sneak peek at the upcoming Gran Turismo movie back in January, and now the film's first full-length trailer provides a better look at PlayStation's latest cinematic adaptation. 
Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough's ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. 















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director’s chair. 
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.]]></summary>

Street Fighter 6 may feature thrilling 1v1 fights, but one of its most exciting features is its World Tour mode. This single-player sandbox story mode is a dramatic shift in what the series has offered, and players recently got to sample a small slice in a recent demo. On a trip to Capcom’s U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, I ventured beyond the demo for a more comprehensive look at what World Tour has to offer.  
World Tour gives players robust tools to craft a custom fighter, then take them to the streets of Metro City and other locations on a journey to create the u…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-01T23:28:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.
Writing this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. 
As a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. 
On a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. 
However, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.

We’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn’t running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. 
The PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering" in the patch notes. 
That doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:
Multiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.
Fixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.
Performance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Fixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis
Fixed various rendering issues.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.
Fixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.
Fixed various collision issues.
Fixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.
Fixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.
Fixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.
Fixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. 
Hopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Super Mario Bros. Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. 
The film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion.
