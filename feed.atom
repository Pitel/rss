Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!


Pokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.


I na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak "snadno" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.


A nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

The highlight of this update is certainly the introduction of the Santa boss, who serves a real challenge for all. But the Winter Event also brings a host of time-limited rewards that you can grind for, and some of them are incredibly unique.


Let's take a look at how you can properly grind the Winter Event and unlock all the available rewards in Jujustu Infinite.


How to unlock Winter Event items in Jujutsu Infinite


To unlock the exclusive items, you'll need Candy Canes. This is an event-exclusive currency, and you can get it by defeating Santa. Of course, it won't be easy to obtain, as the Santa boss is a stern challenge. You'll also have to make sure that…]]></summary>

It’s used in a lot of crafting recipes, and a lot of quests, so you should try to avoid being caught with less than a dragon’s hoard of the material. 


Iron Ingots aren’t a base level material, so you’ll need to gather what you need and then craft them. This does mean you’re likely to spend quite a lot of time mining in various locations, but it can be made easier by dragging along a villager who you’ve given the Mining role to. If they’re a high level, you’ll be able to get a double of the last item to drop from each mining node, making things go much quicker.

After an evening of really expensive content in the form of the Jairzinho Thunderstruck SBC, EA Sports has released a far more affordable option. Once you complete the challenge, you get to pick between two different versions of Bailly. 


Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and which version you should pick.


EA FC 25 Eric Bailly NumeroFUT SBC tasks


The Eric Bailly NumeroFUT SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Eric Bailly NumeroFUT SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest NumeroFUT SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - LaLiga



Any 10 84-rated items


Remiro 84



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Carvajal 86


Ruben Dias 88


Gavi 83


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Nkunku 84



Unlike the John Stones NumeroFUT SBC, there's clearly one version you can go for. The card with Intercept+ is significantly better. The card also offers Defender++, which is the current in-game meta. The card also offers Jockey, Bruiser, Aerial, and Block but lacks Anticipate. However, you can't expect much for fodder worth 60,000 coins. 


The 85 Pace, 89 Defending, and 84 Physicality are all decent stats, and he can be a great addition to consider for beginners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's very self-apparent that nostalgia, specifically, is a crucial aspect of modern gaming. Emulation's been important since forever now, certainly, but it's particularly relevant nowadays, and more powerful than ever before. Games such as Sierra Entertainment's output are, however, often overlooked in this respect. They certainly shouldn't be, though.


Sierra Entertainment's classic adventure games generally released on MS-DOS, Macintosh, and early iterations of Windows proper, and they were all the rage at the time. Though point 'n' click games have mostly gone the way of the dodo in this day and age, even more so than real-time strategy titles have, they used to be the de facto genre for computer gaming.

How to obtain the Rod of the Exalted One in Fisch


The Rod of the Exalted One, or the Exalted Rod in short, can be obtained by collecting 7 different Enchant Relics. Once you obtain these relics, you'll have to place them at the hidden altar located in Mushgrove Swamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The curtains have closed on another Awesome Games Done Quick marathon, which delivered an incredible week of speedrunning for a good cause. The final numbers have the fine folks at GDQ racing their way to $2,556,305 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.


Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 streamed around the clock from January 5 to 12, wrapping up with a four-player Super Metroid Map Randomizer Race. The live event was held in Pittsburgh, PA, at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown Hotel. There were a ton of impressive speed runs before that, of course, and you owe it to yourself to check some of them out. Some particularly musical highlights include a Crazy Taxi speedrun with an accompanying live concert, Elden Ring with a saxophone, and a New Super Mario Bros. Wii run that had speedrunner Wes beating the game while playing piano. 




This matches the total for Summer Games Done Quick 2024, which streamed back in July and raised the same amount for Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières. This brings the total raised across all Games Done Quick streaming events to over $54 million since 2010. 


If you're already feeling a little empty after suddenly not having a full week of speedruns to look forward to, GDQ has been working hard to get everything on YouTube shortly after streaming live. Hey, why not watch Dr. Doot's aforementioned Elden Ring saxophone run while you're here! 




Or, if you have almost seven hours to spare, you can catch Woadyb's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth run. 


Beyond that, GDQ will be back to highlight Black speedrunning talent with Back to Black 2025, which supports Race Forward during its February 6-9 stream. Frost Fatales 2025 follows March 9-16, and from there, it's not too long until SGDQ 2025 from July 6-12 in Minneapolis, MN.

The year is 2025 and Lord of the Rings feels very much like it's "a thing" again. We're not sure that it ever really went away, to be honest, but we've got The Rings of Power on TV (and it's actually rather good now), the War of the Rohirrim hit cinemas, a 'Hunt for Gollum' movie is planned, and, perhaps most importantly for us, more Middle Earth games are on the horizon.
Gollum launched on multiple consoles in 2023 — though the Switch version is still in limbo (something we're sure you were all devastated about) after Daedalic shut down its internal development team. But Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game — surely a shoo-in for 2025's Clunkiest Title Award — is right around the corner, bringing a slice of Hobbit life to Switch in March. And, with Embracer Group now legally behind the IP's wheel, we'd be surprised if things are stopping there.

But planning to catch this creature and actually managing to land it will be two different things. Based on player accounts on the official Discord server, the Eternal Frostwhale is extremely elusive and rarely spawns at any given location. You'll also require great in-game equipment to land it as well, making it nearly impossible for beginners.


Let's take a look at how you can reel in this behemoth and add it to your existing Bestiary collection.

Before Nintendo's subscription service took off, fans were able to individually buy and download the company's retro titles and play them whenever they wanted thanks to the Virtual Console service.
Although this was eventually replaced with Switch Online's tier-based retro library, Nintendo apparently had plans to carry over the existing Virtual Console service and add online functionality. This information comes from "a new leak of iQue emails not too long ago" according to Yakumono's Blog, run by dataminer (and Nintendo Life user) LuigiBlood.

It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals is rapidly becoming one of the most popular multiplayer video games running right now, and it's just reached a massive milestone on Steam. For a few hours, Marvel Rivals was the most-played game on Steam, outperforming some top-tier competitors and proving its staying power within the multiplayer scene.


Marvel Rivals' Season 1 launch turned it into the most-played game on Steam

When Marvel Rivals launched in December last year, it instantly became one of the most popular games on Steam. The game amassed over 2,000,000 players on Steam within hours of its release, shattering expectations. However, some people remained unconvinced the game's time in the spotlight would last long. Some onlookers, including former Blizzard head Mike Ybarra, downplayed the game's success, predicting its post-launch hype would fizzle out fast. 


Luckily for fans, Marvel Rivals' harshest critics got a huge reality check when Season 1 dropped on January 10, 2025. According to SteamDB, Marvel Rivals racked up 644,269 concurrent players in the hours after Season 1 went live, breaking its previous all-time peak player count and sending it flying to the top of Steam's most-played game chart.


While Marvel Rivals would lose its spot at the top of the pyramid within a few hours, it's impossible to deny how impressive that accomplishment is. In the short time it was the most-played game on Steam, Marvel Rivals outperformed some stiff competition. This included Path of Exile 2, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2, all of which have become mainstays on Steam's most-played lists.


With Season 1 in full swing, the odds of Marvel Rivals' player count getting swelled by word-of-mouth are pretty high. If that happens, the little hero shooter that could might end up topping Steam's most-played list soon.

If you’ve binged all six episodes and are itching for more tales from the American Frontier, there are a lot of options available to you, including TV and movies alike. However, perhaps the best way to lose yourself in tales from the Midwest is through books, and there are a lot of tales to choose from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent critical and commercial success of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has cemented this collection of live action films based on Sega's iconic mascot as one of the best video game adaptations (and best movie trilogies) in the industry. As a result of their huge cultural impact, fans all around the world have fallen in love with its colorful cast of characters.


Whether they're humans portrayed by famous actors or anthropomorphic animals voiced by talented voice actors; whether they are new incarnations of iconic figures from the original video games or they were specifically created for the movies, the characters in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trilogy are as likable as they're well-written. The only question is: Who are the absolute best ones in the series? (so far...)

It’s one of his favorite games, and it was something cute to stuff into his stocking, but it got me feeling nostalgic about my own experience with Tamagotchis. 


Like an idiot, I voiced this nostalgic longing and my fiancé, being as wonderful as he is, immediately ordered me a new one and I actually, for a brief time, felt excited at the prospect of raising this pixel pet. Then it arrived, I named it "Pixy" as it started beeping, and it only managed to reach the ripe old age of two before it inexplicably died after being fed nothing but cake because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.

Worryingly, this prediction has come true in the form of the PlayerScope plugin. 


FFXIV is strictly against any use of plugins or mods. Anyone caught using any type of game-changing software is permanently banned, which should be enough to put anybody off. However, this hasn’t stopped people from creating or using mods, and the latest doing the rounds is particularly troublesome, and it seems to have been enabled by changes made by Square Enix themselves and were warned of at the time.

A lot has changed in video gaming since Switch launched in 2017. Beyond all Nintendo's handheld hybrid switching, we now live in a world where a Nintendo game on mobile is a fairly normal occurrence and both Microsoft and Sony publish games on Nintendo's console. Crazy.
As we await official word on the next generation of Nintendo hardware, it's got us thinking back on the current cycle and the games that defined the era for Switch owners.

MMOs are still dominating the gaming space, and they’re an incredible way to meet friends, have fun, and work towards goals without too much pressure. 


There are a lot of MMOs out there, and it can be hard to decipher which ones are still worth playing. New titles are released all the time, and they either quickly build up a solid player base or they fade into obscurity with a few cult followers. Of course, MMOs, by definition, are “massively multiplayer”, so player numbers definitely count when it comes to deciding what to play. 


Here are 10 MMOs that are worth playing in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Golden Tides (Tides of Gold) update has introduced a few limited species you can find in Fisch, and doing so will be necessary if you want to 100% your Bestiary.


The latest update has introduced some exciting content for the fans to grind over the weekend, which includes the Dr. Glimmerfin quest, which will get you an exclusive boat and a new rod. But that's not all, as you can add five new species to your collection.


All Fisch Golden Tide Bestiary species


Let's first take a look at the five new species that are part of Bestiary.


Species
Type
Preferred Bait




Tidal Pike
Limited
Night Shrimp


Confetti Shark
Limited
Deep Coral


Eternal Frostwhale
Limited
Shark Head


Hourglass Bass 
Limited
Aurora Bait


Countdown Perch
Limited
Weird Algae






You can catch all five species any time of the day, which makes it relatively easy as far as the day/night cycle is concerned. But they will only spawn in the Golden Tide Pool and won't be available anywhere else.


Golden Tide Pool location in Fisch


Unfortunately, the Golden Tide Pool doesn't have a fixed location and spawns randomly. However, you can watch out for a few clues to find it after the pool spawns on your server. First, there will be a server-wide notification, which will state that the Golden Tide Pool has started.


While the exact location won't be announced, you can find it by tracking a bright orange marker. Just travel to the marker, and you'll be able to catch all five limited species.


If you haven't figured out by their limited nature already, these species won't be spawning indefinitely. They are likely going to be available until January 18th, when the next update is expected to drop. Make sure to complete the Mr. Glimmerfin quest as well if you're looking for a new ride and rod in Fisch.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028.

Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

Rightsholders and authorities hope that the criminal prosecution of the 41-year-old (re)seller, who served a few hundred customers, will send a deterrent message. However, the big fish in this hugely profitable industry remain unscathed.

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it's from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital "C", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. "Bioshock Infinite in space", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient "Chinese-style" RPG The Bustling World. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they're unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m actually quite happy with how many of my voted games made it into this year’s Advent Calendar, not least because it proves I am acutely in-touch, and definitely didn’t dedicate at least fifty percent of my 2024 playing time to a late-onset Elden Ring obsession. Point being, I can present to you my almost-made-it picks without malice nor bitterness, unlike my loser colleagues who didn’t get as many in the main list. Nyeh nyeh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don't need to shoot, but it's sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip. As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

I lit my cyber-cigarette and put my feet on my desk, I don't know why, I thought it would make me look nonchalant to this strange woman. She wasn't impressed. "Detective," she said, glaring at me with eyes like gorgeous tennis balls, "I want to open today's advent calendar door." I was confused. "Whaddya wanna do that for, missy?" She sat back, relaxed, and pulled a gun from her purse. "I need to stuff a body into it."

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a "fireball of occult potentiality," dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly "embryo universe." The embryo expands "lightly as a thought," with spectral continents "sleeting" through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of "shining threads that followed every movement."

This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.

The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was "hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal." I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.
