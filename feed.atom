        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released an update of the Sand Land story trailer that focuses mostly on the English voice cast.


I’ve kept one eye on Sand Land, but not because it’s based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama. It’s mostly because the desert environment and assortment of vehicles remind me of my beloved Metal Max. The latest trailer shows off a bit more of the vehicles, with their combat being shown off in particular. I mean, we've seen this trailer before and even heard previews, but I just like tank combat.




As for the voices, they sure are speaking English. I kind of hate voiceovers in trailers because when they’re devoid of most of their context, it just feels off. Bandai Namco provided a list of who’s playing what role, and I had to look all of them up. Risa Mei is doing Beelzebub, John Lipow is on Rao (the ranger-looking guy), Owen Thomas is Thief, and Keith Silverstein is Lucifer. It’s an experienced cast, but no massive celebrities from other media, which is honestly preferable.


Sand Land is set in an expansive wasteland that has overtaken the planet in the wake of war and environmental disasters. Beelzebub joins a crew that seeks to find a source of water in the sun-blasted environment. It’s based on a 2000 serial comic from Weekly Shōnen Jump by Akira Toriyama. I’m just here for the tanks and vehicular exploration.


The release date for Sand Land release date is still to be announced, but it’s set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.

Time to get busy, then. The cows need to be milked, the eggs need to be gathered from the chicken coop, the seeds need to be sowed and watered. 


You might find an hour to do a bit scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don't forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it's crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 Community Director Adam Fletcher revealed on Twitter today that the ARPG will be Steam Deck Verified when it launches on Steam. Diablo 4 will be heading to Steam with the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. The second season releases on October 17 on all platforms, and will be the first time D4 is playable on Steam. The Store Page for the game on Steam has already been updated to indicate its verification.




This is honestly a pretty big move. The other Blizzard game that recently came to Steam, Overwatch 2, is Playable on Steam Deck but not Verified. One of the many issues players have with OW2 on Steam is its poor performance on Steam Deck.


The decision to make Diablo 4 Steam Deck Verified is a good one because the gameplay fits pretty naturally on a handheld device like the Steam Deck. The verification indicates that Valve has tested D4 on the device and can verify that it is fully functional and works great with the built-in controls and display.


A note on the verification page points out that the singleplayer gameplay will still require an active internet connection.


Diablo 4 comes to Steam and Steam Deck on October 17 with the launch of Season 2.

The game, based on the Spy x Family anime, is in the works for Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC, and it's essentially a minigame collection starring Anya. Yes, the littlest faux family member is adorable enough to deserve her own game. Their adopted, prescient dog, Bond, would do well as a playable hero, too. 


As a whole, though, Operation Memories looks like an appetizer of empty calories before a more substantial main course.


What we've seen so far isn't exactly bad, per se, but I'm anxious for the main course. A new trailer features spirited narration from the anime's cast as "Agent Anya-kun" gets to work. The telepathic tot exercises and cooks with Yor, feeds Uncle Yuri, takes test…]]></summary>

What has me most interested in this one, however, is how it manages to capture the essence of a slightly offbeat home port of an arcade brawler.


A demo made its way online as part of Steam Next Fest, giving us a chance to check out a few hard-hitting areas. It's easy to see what Maiden Cops is going for from the first frame. You can choose from one of three Maiden Cops: Priscilla Salamander, Nina Usagi, and Meiga Holstaur. …]]></summary>

Well, the day has come, so what's the mind behind games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and more to do next? Why, start a YouTube channel, of course! Kamiya went live with the appropriately named Hideki Kamiya Channel, and the first video is up in both Japanese and English. 


The outspoken, block-happy creator didn't waste any time getting to the question on everyone's minds. The inaugural video addresses why he quit PlatinumGames and what his plans are next. In fact, the first thing we see is Kamiya walking out with a box full of items from a freshly-cleared desk. "Oh well, I'm done (with Platinum)," he says. "I left. I'm over it. I'm so over it."

Specifically, I was thinking about Ken Silverman’s legendary Build Engine, a cluster of technical trickery that stands as, perhaps, the best 2.5D raycasting engine ever designed.


So, I was excited when Ion Fury popped up, doing just that. Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison was created as a stand-in for Duke Nukem, so it seems appropriate that Shelly (I’m not sure Bombshell is a nickname that will stick) would eventually make it to the engine that made him famous. Unfortunately, I couldn’t really get into it.


Then I tried again later and still couldn’t get into it.


Then I tried another time, and it still wasn’t clicking.

If you're not an indie fan, and you prefer your games to have high production value, you may be tempted to avoid the event altogether. However, you're highly advised to at least give Europa a shot, because it is one of the gems of Steam Next Fest that is quickly gaining attention online. 


The demo throws you onto Europa, which is one of Jupiter's moons. The landscape has been turned into a paradise teeming with alien plants and animals. It's a game that relies on minimalism when it comes to gameplay and storytelling. This will, naturally, turn some players off. However, if you have the patience for it, you may find the experience irresistibly alluring.

        <updated>2023-10-12T15:09:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage is now the biggest new-gen launch for Ubisoft, according to the official Assassin's Creed X account on Wednesday. The French publisher shared its Assassin's Creed Mirage sales news, noting figures include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Ubisoft also provided some fun stats about our playtime.




Initial Assassin's Creed Mirage sales numbers seem impressive


"We are proud to [..] share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X-S)," said Ubisoft in a social media post thanking its audience. "A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


Ubisoft did not give specific numbers as to how Assassin's Creed Mirage has sold. However, we now know it has initially sold better in its first week than the likes of Watch Dogs: Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Immortals: Fenyx Rising.

Some of the stats celebrated the occasion are kind of fun, too. So far, players have spent 479 collective years parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad. Assassins also took 60 million Leaps of Faith. Then there's the most important, we've pet 1.2 million street cats.


Assassin's Creed Mirage is a stroll away from the massive open-world formula of recent titles like Valhalla and Odyssey. It's in a smaller space in Baghdad with a focus on the core stealth gameplay. Perhaps this approach appeals to lapsed fans of the series. It is also at a cheaper price point of $49.99.


"For the most part, Mirage achieves its goal of returning to its assassin ways," says our review. "But in some ways, it also shows me why Ubisoft made the decision to take the franchise in a new direction in the first place."

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, we told you that British developer Team17 may experience job losses following the CEO leaving the company. Sadly, it looks as though this may be the case after all, with the studio possibly losing a third of its staff.


That's according to a recent report from Eurogamer, which says that cuts to Team17 could see 91 positions being affected. Initially, it was thought that the QA department would be the main focus of the layoffs. However, it appears as though redundancies may be felt in the IT, HR, marketing, customer service, and usability departments.

Developers are said to have contacted Eurogamer with concerns that upcoming games published by Team17 may be in jeopardy. At the time of writing, the studio has not issued an official statement, nor publically given a reason behind the restructure.


A bad time to be part of a development team


This seems to be just one more example of a wider issue in the current gaming industry. Publishers and studios have been restructuring departments and teams, which has unfortunately led to staff members being let go.


Recently, it was reported that Naughty Dog had also been hit with layoffs, as had The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us studio Telltale Games. Epic Games has also cut 16% of its workforce recently, impacting around 830 employees in total.


It's not just game developers, either. Streaming service Twitch has also been experiencing layoffs, making it feel like anyone who works in gaming in any capacity isn't safe.


Hopefully, Team17 will issue a statement about the reported layoffs, but right now feels like a shaky time to be involved in the video game industry.

This tasty jam of an indie horror title has a lot of potential, appealing to those who like a bit of Japanese folklore to spread on their gaming toast like some sort of macabre marmalade (that is definitely not a thing).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[D3Publisher has announced that Earth Defense Force 6 is finally getting localized sometime in Spring 2024. It’s coming to PS5 and PC.


Released in Japan in mid-2022, a lot of fans have been wondering if D3 had any intention on bringing it to the West. The series has had some popularity over here since the surprising success of 2006’s Earth Defense Force 2017.

Earth Defense Force 6 is a direct sequel to 2017’s Earth Defense Force 5. 90% of the world’s population was wiped out in the previous invasion, and while the survivors are trying to pick up the pieces, the remaining invaders on the planet are making it difficult. As a result, rather than clean urban areas, you’ll be defending the ruins of civilization from giant bugs and such. Beyond that, it kind of looks like more of the same. You have the four classes – Ranger, Air Raider, Wing Diver, and Fencer – and you’re basically just tasked with killing a lot of kaiju.


My most memorable experience with the series was plucking it from a bargain bin in the early days of the Xbox 360 and playing through it with a close friend. It was jank bordering on kusoge. There was one amazing plasma weapon we got, and whenever I’d fire it, the resulting bright bloom would somehow cross over the split-screen barrier and temporarily blind my co-op partner. It was amazing. I’ve kept up with the series since then, but it really hasn’t changed all that much over the years. And that’s mostly okay. It can be hard to stay invested in more of the same, but the formula endures the test of time.


Earth Defense Force 6 will be coming West sometime in Spring 2024. It’s set to release on PS5 and PC.

From the metropolitan streets of New Atlantis to seeing planets from low orbit, Bethesda has given us an attractive-looking game. But it could always stand to look a little better.


A recent upload to Nexus Mods (as spotted by DSO Gaming) gives us a Starfield HD texture overhaul from user luxor8071. Upping the visuals to 2K or even 8K resolution, this mod replaces plenty of the vanilla textures with higher definition ones.

Currently, the pack gives a spit shine to places like Akila City, New Atlantis, the Milky Way, and some general assets and materials, such as concrete, glass, wood, and water. It's also an ongoing project, with more textures being added in the future.


You cannot stop the modders


Nobody was surprised to see mods for Starfield come out the woodwork. Even before the game released fully, the community was tinkering with Bethesda's new IP. It is the way of life, especially when it comes to PC gaming.


As for Starfield itself, things are going pretty well for not-Skyrim-but-also-not-Elder-Scrolls-6-either. Bethesda released a couple of small patches recently to keep things ticking over, with some larger updates coming soon.


Everyone's going to be wondering where Todd Howard and his team go from here. Obviously, there's the aforementioned TES6, plus Fallout 5. Sadly, these hotly anticipated follow-ups are still years away. For now, we're getting as much as we can out of Starfield. If nothing else, we can at least make it look a bit prettier.

It came out with a huge bang, then fizzled so hard that Sega got out of the console game completely. Given that I still play my Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD, and Dreamcast in my spare time, it's like it never died: but it did! That's why it's so amazing to me that the Sonic franchise has not only endured but is constantly debuting on a system run by its former competitor, Nintendo. All that to say: Sonic Superstars is the main eShop game coming out this week, and will be out on October 17.

Psyonix also explains that item lending was not a supported action, with all trades considered final.

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Princess Peach: Showtime! is slated to hit shelves on March 22, 2024, and as the release date crawls nearer, we're seeing increased marketing for the game. Twitter user @Nintendeal noted that Nintendo has surreptitiously swapped out the box art. This change can be seen on the eStore. 




The new art is almost entirely the same, save for a few extremely minor changes. Most notably, Princess Peach has been slightly edited to have more of a determined face, making her look like she's ready for battle. 


Kung-fu Peach in the background has also been given a fiercer face. Princess Peach isn't the first Nintendo character to get this treatment, as Reddit user /u/Stilgrave has noticed that Kirby gets an angrier face in his Western releases. 


Online, reception to the change has been mixed. Some people like the old face, describing it as friendlier. Others have taken a liking to the redesign which shows that Princess Peach isn't anyone to mess with. 


As trailers reveal, the game will have the princess putting on different outfits that grant her unique abilities. She'll be joined by Stella, who also looks prepared for battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13's 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

Having founded it in 2006 in Osaka, Japan, later working on games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101, he left his reason for leaving up in the air. He simply said, "This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs" and that he feels "this outcome is for the best." Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called "Hideki Kamiya Channel" – and in his first video, he reveals he's not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle.

As spotted by No Context Super Mario on Twitter, it seems the princess has gotten a minor makeover to make her look less surprised and a little more...hmm, we're not sure exactly what that look is. See what you think:

Great games are great no matter how much time has passed, and that remains true of Company of Heroes. The RTS classic that robbed us of our evenings and weekends back in 2006 has returned to the Nintendo Switch in the form of the Company of Heroes Collection and despite an updated control scheme for the console, after a few hours, it became like slipping on a comfortable, familiar pair of boots.
Right from the beginning, we were reminded that this isn’t Call of Duty or another series that glorifies or sanitises warfare. The first mission of the core game drops players directly into the Normandy Beach invasion and treats us to a cutscene where entire platoons of soldiers are mowed down by German machine-gun fire. It is brutal and depressing, as depictions of war should be, and does a good job of setting up the difficult, tactical gameplay that you'll be dropped into.

Back in the day, before Nintendo Direct became a thing, Nintendo was often known for its memorable appearances at events such as Space World and E3.
Some are well known for their meme potential ("My body is ready!") while others are famous for their sheer lunacy (hello Wii Music), but there are some that have become lost to the relentless passage of time that we believe shouldn't be forgotten. One such event is was E3 2000, during which Nintendo had promoted The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the N64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you "There are no wrong choices, only your choices" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about "tracing different pathways" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Hollywood still grapples with strikes and other issues, Disney CEO Bob Iger is pressed on a different matter: gaming. According to Bloomberg, advisers at the company want to expand its video game outreach by transforming Disney from distributing game license to a gaming giant. However, Iger is reportedly not too keen on the idea.


Bloomberg's report outlines the struggles facing Disney and its CEO in detail. Options like gambling, through ESPN and sports betting, have been something that Iger reportedly pushed back on but has now relented on. For gaming, while Disney has licensed their properties to studios, it sounds like Iger's deputies want Disney more involved in the process. One potential option raised by the report is an acquisition, suggesting Electronic Arts as a suitable pick-up.


EA, one of gaming's biggest publishers, seems like an ideal candidate to buy. Over the years, the company has created hugely successful franchises like Titanfall, Mass Effect, and Battlefield. Money-wise, the gaming giant is responsible for the EA Sports catalog of games, which rake in millions a year and lines up with its ESPN interests. EA also has a history with Disney, as they licensed Star Wars for their Battlefront and Jedi series of games. 


Curiously, it sounds like Bob Iger isn't interested in the idea right now. While no reason is given, it's likely that it's not a direction he wants to take Disney. These all are rumors, so, much like the story of Disney's Kingdom Hearts, don't take it too seriously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, you're not reading that wrong. Former late-night host and Cinderella star James Corden reportedly hosted a town hall meeting for Activision. The company, run by Bobby Kotick, is making headlines as Microsoft may close its $68.7 billion purchase of them on Friday. 


According to sources speaking to Windows Central, an internal meeting between Kotick and employees recently occurred. James Corden, the 'mastermind' behind Carpool Karaoke, emceed the conference, much like Jamie Kennedy did at E3 2009: unnecessarily. Kotick, who has been CEO of Activision since 1991, responded to a bevy of questions.




He talks about the potential for AI and VR, as well as Elon Musk's Neuralink. Weirdly, he also mentions that, with Microsoft's advanced technology, a potential Guitar Hero revival was teased. A repeated phrase that popped up a lot during the meeting was "magic", as Kotick believes Microsoft will keep it alive, just as Activision has for more than 40 years.


It seems like the company, likely to soon become part of Microsoft, wants to deliver fresh content to consumers. Having already absorbed studios Blizzard and King, Activision can finally work on creating a bigger legacy. However, it seems they want to experiment with new technologies more than to build upon what they have. Microsoft had said they wanted to compete with Apple and Google in mobile gaming, which led to them purchasing Activision. While some may dislike the company, Call of Duty, Candy Crush Saga, and World of Warcraft continue to make millions of dollars every year. Where the future might go is unclear. But please don't let James Corden be in Call of Duty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

Now, they're finding themselves backed into a corner with their 2023 BlizzCon bundles. What's the issue? Well, the value prospect, for one, coupled with the poor current state of several of their games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen is about to enter a whole new domain: video games. As revealed in today's trailer, Byking and Bandai Namco's Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash launches on February 2, 2024.




What does the Jujutsu Kaisen game cover?


In the game, players make their own 2v2 teams with more than 15 characters from the manga/show to choose from. As each character has their own set of abilities and attacks, combining them with others can lead to unique power dynamics


Narrative-wise, Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash adapts the events of season one of the anime, as well as Jujutsu Kaisen 0. In the story mode, you'll face familiar villains like Sukuna and Jogo and learn about the hidden world of sorcerers. With co-op and competition modes, you'll be able to team up with fellow sorcerers online and face others worldwide in casual or ranked battles. Players will also get to customize their face cards and fighters via costumes. New outfits and cards can be unlocked through gameplay and future DLC.


Screenshot via PlayStation YouTube


Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash will be available in three editions: standard, digital deluxe, and digital ultimate. While the standard only includes the base game, the digital deluxe has the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death DLC and a minigame based on Jujusta 2024 Baseball. Furthermore, the digital ultimate edition comes with all that plus a digital artbook and soundtrack. Additionally, it comes with a costume pack adapting outfits from the "Lost in Paradise" end theme from season one. If you preorder the game, you'll receive the First-Year Jujutsu High DLC costume pack.


Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash expands onto current-gen consoles on February 2, 2024. Pre-orders for Xbox, PC, and PlayStation consoles are available now, with Nintendo Switch's to be available at a later date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm into how weird Super Mario Wonder is. Look, all the obvious jokes about shrooms have already been made, but this game looks strange on the whole. That's a great thing, as 2D Mario has been formulaic throughout its history, so we could use a change-up. I'm just glad we're presumably done with the "New" series: I mean, it's not new anymore! 


All that to say, I just really wanted to share this strange promotional tweet of Bowser being really into an elephant Peach (which is also on YouTube as a short).




Peach speaks (kinda)


In the short 30-second promotional video, Bowser tries to impress Princess Peach with a bouquette of flowers (as he does), and an Elephant Fruit sidles up to the duo and turns Peach into an elephant. After his initial shock, Bowser immediately proposes (we assume) to Peach again. Classic Bowser, completely undeterred by pretty much anything in his life. I can't wait to see him again in Super Mario RPG: he's been missed.


Interestingly enough, this is also a brief look at the voice of Peach, amid a major casting change for Mario. Just give us the full voice credits already, Nintendo! I want to see who has been replaced.


Super Mario Bros. Wonder is out on Switch on October 20, and I can't wait to see what it can do. I have a feeling that what Nintendo has shown off so far is just scratching the surface, which would be the shot in the arm the 2D series needs right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is going to launch a Kyoto storefront (at Kyoto Takashimaya SC) to expand its current lineup in Tokyo and Osaka on October 17 of this year, and they're in the "full hype mode" stage of marketing at the moment. This round comes in the form of photos from the publisher's official Nintendo Tokyo Twitter account, and the store really sells itself at this point.




In addition to Mario-laden structures like a giant pipe (complete with Mario's head coming out of it) and a classic "Mario stage" motif, there are decals for Zelda, Animal Crossing, Pikmin (which I almost missed!), and Splatoon adorning the windows. While three of the four photos showcase the impressive and thematic outside of the store, one of them gives us a look at the merch that will presumably be on sale


At a glance, we spot:



Giant pipe statues


Plush mushrooms and Mario characters/enemies


T-shirts


Bags



Nintendo also gave us an official blog post, with a preview of more merch.


It's not going to be an all-comers situation though, at least at first. Nintendo notes that "A total of 2,000 people will be invited to the pre-opening by lottery," where you can score visits on October 13 and 14. If you're local or plan on visiting Kyoto on those dates, you can apply for the lottery here.


Good luck! I'll likely be there once the crowds die down the next time I visit Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PS Plus Premium members are getting a neat extra perk for their subscription. Sony announced on PlayStation Blog that cloud streaming is coming for select PS5 titles later this month.  


These titles range from ones available on the PlayStation Plus catalog to digital purchases already in users' libraries and Game Trials. Supported titles range from the Resident Evil 4 remake to free-to-play games like Genshin Impact. In-game purchases are also available for streaming, which Sony compares to purchases from downloaded games.


Some PS5 cloud streaming features include playing at up to 4K with HDR and access to the console's audio capabilities. Video capture is also available for up to 3 minutes along with screenshots.


PS5 cloud streaming will launch worldwide in phases based on the region. Japan will receive the feature first on October 17 before reaching Europe on October 23. North America has the latest launch on October 30. The feature will only be available on PS5 consoles at launch.


Cloud streaming their games is a neat perk to the service for anyone with PS Plus Premium and is low on storage. Even with the PS5 Slim's 1TB of storage, many modern games are exorbitantly big, so being able to stream them could potentially mitigate storage issues at least a bit.


Whether PS5 cloud streaming adds substantial value to PS Plus Premium is up to the individual player. Game Trials potentially benefit from this since they are more or less extended demos, meaning far less time investment. Even so, PS cloud streaming can be spotty even with great internet. 


Hopefully, any benefits from streaming PS5 titles will outweigh the cons that come with it. Its use will vary with each subscriber's internet speed, but ideally, it helps avoid lengthy download times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2006, the iconic Super Mario series celebrated 10 years since its triumphant leap to 3D with Super Mario 64. That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics. While many celebrated the continued success of this 3D evolution for on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced what games are being added to their various PlayStation Plus tiers this month, and buried with the rest of their Classics Catalog additions is I.Q. Final. It will be arriving on October 17.


I.Q. Final is the sequel to 1997’s I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, which you may remember from PS1 demo discs. It’s a fantastic little game that presents a great challenge, terrific music, and a tremendous blow to your self-esteem. It has you dropping bomb tiles to try and clear a path through a rolling stack of blocks. Don’t blow up the forbidden tiles, though. Each one you accidentally destroy drops a row from the platform you’re standing on, which dwindles throughout, drastically cutting down the time you have to surgically clear a path through the blocks.


The 1998 sequel was never released in North America. It was released in Japan as Kurushi Final: Mental Blocks and Europe as I.Q. Final. Even with its various PlayStation Network releases, it never made it over here. The sequel comes with four modes: 100 Attack, Survival, Create, and Final. 100 Attack has you take on individual puzzles, Survival is an endless mode, and Final is the classic design.


I recently discovered the greatness of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube. After I completed it, I then immediately researched where I could go next, only to find none of the sequels came to North America. This includes 2000’s I.Q. Remix+ and 2006’s I.Q. Mania. So, finally getting I.Q. Final is an absolute treat.


Unless they leave it in PALs 50hz format. And unless they make it only available to Premium subscribers. I have to admit, Sony has a great vector on hurting my feelings.


I.Q. Final joins the PlayStation Classics Catalog on October 17.

Those skins are part of a new wave of cosmetics incoming for the game’s Season 7: Rise of Darkness, but they’re not part of the standard premium battle pass. Instead, they’ll cost you another $40 - as much as the whole of Overwatch 1 did when it was first released. As you can imagine, people aren’t too chuffed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hold onto your subscriptions because Sony has revealed the games coming to PlayStation Plus on October 17. This set involves a bunch of horror games, just in time for Hallowe’en. It's definitely not a bad mix, but the Classic Catalog line-up is anemic, as usual. On the other hand, I'm surprised by one particular game's inclusion.

Here are the titles joining Extra and Premium:



Alien: Isolation


Gotham Knights


House of Ashes


Outlast 2


Disco Elysium: The Final Cut


Dead Island: Definitive Edition


Elite Dangerous


Far: Changing Tides


Gungrave G.O.R.E.


Eldest Souls


Roki



Meanwhile, the Classic Catalog additions are as follows:



Tekken 6 (PS3)


Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny (PSP)


Ape Escape Academy (PSP)


I.Q. Final (PS1)



This certainly is a decent bunch of additions, but with the recent PlayStation Plus price hike, there’s no way I’ll be touching the Extra and Premium tiers. Even the Classic Catalog additions are better than the usual fare, with I.Q. Final being an especially interesting addition. I can only hope that the PS1 and PSP titles are available piecemeal, which is never guaranteed with Sony.


As for new games, Alien: Isolation is one of my favorite horror games. Elite Dangerous is a rather robust space exploration game from a legendary series. Disco Elysium is one I haven’t gotten around to because I’m afraid it might be too depressing for my mindset. Meanwhile, I really don’t like Dead Island. Something for everyone.


These titles will be arriving for the various PlayStation Plus tier subscribers on October 17.

This guide was originally published back in February 2022 with the title 'All Six American Football Games On Switch (Yes, You Read That Right)'. However, in the time since, several more gridiron games have appeared on the system — there's now a total of 11 by our count — so we've rejigged and updated things a little bit to make this a comprehensive list of every American Football game on Switch. Let us know below if we missed any and we'll be sure to update. Enjoy!

As we write this it's nearly time for the SUPER BOWL, which we understand has to be shouted with great enthusiasm. As a bit of history, here in NL Towers during Thanksgiving we had a bright idea - "Let's do a best NFL-style list for Switch, like the proper football / soccer one we did in the Summer!"

With the formal weekly story updates culminating in a finale for Week 7, all that remains, barring any substantial deviations from the norm, are a few audio logs, lore entries, and a final activity in the Imbaru Engine. But instead of a satisfying conclusion to the suspense that had been building even before the Season of the Witch began, players got a confusing mess of a cutscene that prompted more questions than it provided answers. Perhaps worst of all, critical narrative-moving events occur directly after the depicted scene, partially nullifying the finale's cinematic. However, that vital information lives only in lore pages that most players will never see.

According to the Expansion Pass for Dead Island 2, Haus is the first of two planned story expansions. In Haus, players will explore new locations and discover new weapons and skill cards while having a front-row seat to the slow decay of a cryptic group of survivors.

A Deadly Trip to Malibu


The expansion will bring players to a surreal psycho-horror dreamscape in Malibu as they investigate a mysterious cult. The storyline-focused expansion revolves around a billionaire cult that has left behind humanity's moral restraints. The stylish Malibu villa will serve as both a sanctuary and a machine as players explore the deranged labyrinth.


From a gameplay perspective, Haus will introduce several new weapons. The new K-ROSSBOW, Hog Roaster, and Dead Islands weapons were mentioned in the release. There are also eight new skill cards that players can acquire to expand their arsenal.


Dead Island 2's Haus expansion releases on November 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you've finished screaming, let me re-emphasise that this story is one of those "according to report" stories. It comes from unnamed sources at Activision-Blizzard, describing a recent all-hands meeting during which CEO Bobby Kotick laid out his vision for the company and gaming at large following Activison's acquisition by Microsoft, which is tipped to finally conclude this week. Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim. It sounds like a David Lynch fever dream.

Because, for lower-end and mid-range builds especially, do you truly need any other CPU cooler? The Hyper 212 Evo V2 near-perfectly  balances simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability; it’s like the PC component equivalent of Charles Eames’ museum-beloved leg splint, only less stackable. More to the point, it’s down to £33 in the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale, equalling its lowest price of 2023 thus far.

        <updated>2023-10-11T15:42:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is almost upon us. After 13 years, fans will soon experience the sequel to the cult horror Xbox 360 hit. If you're excited about the game, would you be interested in a free copy? Let me rephrase: would you be interested in a free copy if you're already purchasing a new graphics card?


That's what Nvidia is currently offering, at least. If you're in the market for some current-gen graphical firepower, and you want some survival horror goodness to go with it, you can get Alan Wake 2 free with purchases of select GPUs.




According to the Nvidia website, you'll be eligible if you buy an RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080, and 4090 (if you feel like splashing out). It's not just PCs, either. A laptop powered by the mobile versions of the 4070, 4080, and 4090 graphics chips also qualify.


T's and C's apply


Nvidia is offering this bundle until November 13, so you have a couple of weeks after the game comes out to take advantage of it. Of course, not everyone can afford brand-new hardware right now, but if you are looking to upgrade, this might be an enticing offer. Do check the site for full terms and conditions, though.


Alan Wake 2 is also one of the few games that features version 3.5 of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech. As such, it kind of makes sense that Team Green would want to partner with developer Remedy Entertainment.


As for the game itself, we're fast approaching spooky season, so horror is going to be everywhere by the time Halloween rolls around. Fans of the original are no doubt looking forward to the much-anticipated sequel. Hell, even I'm keen to check it out, and I wasn't a huge fan of Alan Wake to begin with.

Its annual Mob Vote also means players can decide which creature gets added next. However, some want to see this get tossed into lava.


A recent petition is asking the developer to "stop the Mob Vote," scrapping this voting system entirely. At the time of writing, 354,836 people have signed, with 500,000 being the eventual goal. 




Mob voting for 2023 is said to begin October 13. It offers a chance for fans to have some say in what mob gets implemented into Minecraft's world. Last year, it was the turn of the Sniffer. This year, people are being asked to choose between the penguin, the crab, or the armadillo.

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the "father of wargaming", in the mid-1800s. 


"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies," says Menard. "And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the Lobotomy.
Bringing cult classics to a more modern, updated platform can be a risky proposition. What, if anything, do you change, and what do you keep the same? When the game you happen to be porting originated on the DS, a certain degree of change is inevitable given the shift from a two-screen to a single-screen format, so naturally, a careful balance has to be struck in order to rope in new players while keeping original fans happy. With Dementium: The Ward, developer Atooi has opted for the safest route possible, porting its 2015 3DS remaster of the 2007 original over to the Switch with as few unnecessary changes as possible. While this makes for an authentic recreation that helps preserve the game in light of the 3DS eShop closure, it also highlights some of its unfortunate drawbacks.
Taking place within a creepy medical ward, your protagonist awakens with no memory, and it’s up to you to escape from the complex alive, fighting off gruesome enemies and solving puzzles along the way. It’s your typical survival horror but with first-person mechanics; in a way, it feels like a precursor to what Resident Evil would eventually morph into with its seventh mainline entry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. With reports indicating that the deal is set to close tomorrow, on October 13, the saga is almost over. Ahead of that deal's finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we've learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is just around the corner, launching on the Switch on October 20th, 2023. As such, Nintendo is ramping up its marketing campaign with adverts left, right, and centre, making sure that everybody and their Nan are aware of the upcoming title.
The latest ad is a rather amusing video showcasing Peach and her persistent stalker, Bowser, who forgoes the usual kidnapping plot in favour of a simple flower. However, a piece of Elephant Fruit tumbles by and is quickly absorbed by Peach, transforming her into Elephant Peach.

We're less than a week away from Sonic's return to the second dimension (well, not really, but it's a side-on platformer in the classic mould, okay?) in Sonic Superstars. After spending some hands-on time with it back at Summer Game Fest, this throwback to the classic 2D games was showing a lot of promise, so we're eager to see if the wait has been worth it.
As is customary, Japanese gaming publication Famitsu has its review out several days before other outlets around the globe, and it seems like a positive outcome for Sonic fans, as highlighted by Ryokuta2089. (Thanks, Gematsu.)

The trigger is this year's Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

With the news that the Wii U and 3DS online services will be shut down in 'early April' 2024, fans are undoubtedly dismayed at the idea of no longer being able to play certain games online.
One such title is the original Super Mario Maker, which launched on the Wii U back in 2015 before a 3DS version followed in 2016. The key thing with this one is that the vast selection of community-built levels will be unplayable once the online servers shut down (presumably, the original creators will still be able to play their own levels).

Today though, this monitor crashes into new relevance as it's been discounted to just $200 at LG's US store, an incredible price that makes it almost an impulse buy pickup for anyone that wants to try out the majesty of an ultrawide monitor.

        <updated>2023-10-10T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: 
An update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6
October 9, 2023
As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

        <updated>2023-10-10T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company's games won't hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won't be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.
October 9, 2023
Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer's Diablo IV review. For more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, check out Game Informer's preview here and then read up on the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from last week's Call of Duty Next livestream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a "mixed reality" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims.

You can find all of the highlights in our Prime Big Deal Days graphics card deals guide, but I wanted to draw special attention to a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti listings; the most attainable members of the infamously pricey RTX 40 series, now even lighter on the old wallet.

Since player progress gained unofficially upsets Cognosphere's business model, a crackdown isn't unexpected. The fact that the developer could be identified over five allegedly infringing screenshots comes as much more of a surprise.

When pirated downloads peak or slow down, movie theater visits show a similar trend. While this may sound counterintuitive, the finding is actually quite obvious. Correlation is not causation and pirates are people too.

Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game "built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance."
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do love a game that tells you upfront what it's about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, "underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a "rat god".

Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to "overstaffing". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," reads an official FAQ from the group. "This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis."

With Assassin's Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin's Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.

Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HyperX's Cloud Orbit S is a fascinating wireless gaming headset with planar magnetic drivers. Despite the name, this headset is produced by audio experts Audeze and the Cloud Orbit S is 99% the same as the Audeze Mobius, just with a slightly different colour scheme, simpler microphone and without Bluetooth support. That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. 
The Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it's available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings.

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for "Axis Football 2022" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.
Axis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.
The result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4060 Ti has emerged as something of a sweet spot in Nvidia's current-gen graphics card lineup, being more affordable than the RTX 4070 and above while providing better performance per pound than the 4060 below it - despite some reservations over its 8GB VRAM capacity and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance uplift compared to the RTX 3060 Ti. However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. 
The RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.

A shooter set in their gunmetal grey sci-fi universe, Vanguard puts you into the shoes of mercenaries, dropping onto planets to retrieve equipment from wrecked ships, battling it out with AI-controlled pirates and other squads of human players. It’s Escape from Tarkov by way of the galaxy of New Eden.


If you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they've only gotten one out the door before.

Then again, few VR games have found a formula that is as dependable and repeatable as Schell Games' collection of spy capers. Much in the same way that the James Bond series has a set structure and tropes, only I Expect You To Die's blueprint involves pastiche and puzzles rather than cars, gadgets, and variously objectified women.

So the news that CD Projekt Red have partnered with a production company to create a live action adaptation project set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077? I'm onboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-registrations have gone live for Konami's Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive drama for mobiles - I know, shush, I'm sure it'll come to PCs eventually - which follows a cast of characters around the world who are being tormented by monsters from the eponymous Town of Woe.
My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield's launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG's next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you're in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns to one of our recent previous messes to discuss Payday 3. More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077's recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?
We've also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin's Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, "the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years." That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very much like an assassin sliding a poison needle into your wrist while shaking your hand, Ubisoft have added Denuvo's anti-piracy/anti-cheating DRM software to Assassin's Creed: Mirage in the game's day-one update, aka patch 1.0.2. We've known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what's baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin's Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

Adventure Mode, in case you've been living under a rock (which I guess you probably have, if you've been playing Dwarf Fortress), is the open world roguelike RPG element of the game, which lets you roam the enormous realm you've generated and even tour/loot/disturb the unquiet spirits of your own, abandoned fortress. Alas, there's no word on a release date for the Steam edition's Adventure Mode beyond "not this year".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Mirage during a special celebratory event for the franchise's 15th anniversary. After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…]]></summary>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion's Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…]]></summary>

They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can?

We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 
"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many are the horror games that haunt the dark, but it takes a real gift for creepy-crawlies to pull off a horror game that's set in the light. I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I've got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

        <updated>2023-10-04T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is "driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters'," a press release reads. "Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources." 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves," the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. 
For more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.
https://t.co/nOyzBImHCE
October 4, 2023
"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software," Nintendo's announcement reads. "This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution."
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if "an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that "for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop." 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. 
For more, read Game Informer's farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop.

For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio.

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

When I played Super Mario Bros. Wonder in August, I came away extremely impressed by the creativity at play with the series' return to the 2D side of the coin. I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

In the 11 years since the last 2D game launched, we've received multiple re-releases, two Super Mario Maker titles, two mainline 3D titles, and even a mobile auto-runner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, developer Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Games revealed that it was bringing its Batman: Arkham trilogy to the Switch this fall. This collection does not include Batman: Arkham Origins (a great game), which was developed by Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal. The Batman: Arkham Trilogy, as the Switch collection is called, was due out this month on October 13 but has now been delayed to December. 
More specifically, Batman: Arkham Trilogy hits Swtich on December 1. As for why, the team says more time is needed on its development. 
"More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch," Rocksteady's statement on Twitter reads. "We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
