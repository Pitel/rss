        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gore-trait Of Ruin.
The genre blend of Metroidvania and Soulslike is a tried and true combination. And it makes sense; two styles of game with a deep focus on exploration and strict difficulty were bound to cross paths. Games like Salt and Sanctuary, Blasphemous, and — of course — Hollow Knight have successfully taken what makes the genres and mashed them into a mini-genre of their own (although some would argue that Dark Souls itself is essentially a Metroidvania already). Debuting developers Mantra and Sinergia Games have thrown their own hat into the ring in the form of Elderand, which further shows why this mix works, even if this particular concoction could do with being more potent.
You take on the role of a nameless hunter who has washed up in a mysterious land with his crew dead and no bearings to work from. This place is filled with a litany of monsters and threats, and throughout your journey, you unravel a tense plot involving a cult, a serpent society, and a village under threat. While the story is a lot easier to follow than its FromSoftware inspirations, Elderand also tells a lot of its story through the use of item descriptions, letters found across the world, and environmental storytelling. Truth be told, the story didn’t do much for us, with a lot of it being omnipresent text flaring onto the screen. However, the worldbuilding impressed us, each of the game's areas feels cohesive, and you can really see the effects of events prior to the game beginning.

This strictly non-canonical dating simulator is completely safe for work, unlike many fan creations in the Overwatch universe, and allows the player to interact with either Genji or Mei on romantic occasions set in various recognizable Overwatch map locations.
As a reward for completing the game, exclusive titles and in-game cosmetics will be granted depending on which options you choose. Up for grabs are the Hanzo Cupid's Kiss highlight introduction and cute titles which will automatically be applied to players' accounts.

There are a lot of reasons I play video games. Sometimes it's to escape. Other times, I just want to feel challenged, to feel like I accomplished something for the day. Then there are the games I play out of habit having been introduced to the franchise in my youth. But mostly, I play games to stave off boredom. Because when I'm bored, I eat, and I don't want to boredom eat anymore. So I keep my hands busy with a controller, and my eyes distracted with the colorful images of whatever game I have loaded up on my console. Years ago, I would turn to games like The Sims to keep myself preoccupied, but over the last decade or so, I've found myself turning to a completely different genre of game to beat back the boredom: first-person dungeon crawlers.

Artificial Disasters has announced that their “reversed city-builder” Flooded will be washing out to sea on March 15, 2023.
You might be wondering what a “reversed city-builder” means. For me, personally, it brought back memories of calling every single disaster down on my SimCity 2000 creations. However, Artificial Disasters is using the descriptor as a way of explaining the slowly disappearing terrain in Flooded. Don’t get too comfortable with your initial landmass because, over time, it will be washed away. The goal is to place your buildings carefully to escape the approaching waves.
[embed]https://youtu.be/qCA1hjRS9bU[/embed]
Tied into this are some RTS and rogue-lite elements. There are campaign, quickplay, and endless modes to tackle. The campaign is story-driven, having you build arks to travel the expanding oceans to figure out what is causing them to rise. You’ll have to defend yourself from other survivors out to plunder your settlements because even when faced with the end, humans will always be eager to destroy lives.
City-builders is one of my favorite relaxation genres. However, Flooded looks like it’s aiming to add an element of stress with its constantly ticking countdown. Still, I always enjoy a bit of progress to give a nice framework to the constant people-pleasing. If I have one hang-up, it’s that I’m not crazy about the art style. However, Artificial Disasters is a solo developer effort, and it can be difficult for one person to cover every aspect of design. It’s definitely not a deal-breaker for me..
Flooded hits PC on March 15, 2023. If you’d like to see if it’s your speed, a demo is available via Steam and GOG.

Tomorrow will see Epic Games Store offer up yet another free game for its army of users, with any and all EGS customers able to pick up Daedalic Entertainment's quirky strategy sim Warpips for the very agreeable price of Absolutely Nothing. Huh, say it again.
https://youtu.be/hQRwUsxi2Pg
Developed by indie outfit Skirmish Mode Games and originally launched in spring 2022, Warpips is a fast-paced, tug-of-war strategy title, which offers players quick-to-learn, hard-to-master battles that choose to focus on the larger scale of chaos, rather than the time-consuming minutiae of most strategy sims. Warpips tasks players with building up a small army of infantry and vehicles, before diving into bombastic, fast-paced warfare, with a heavy emphasis on damage and destruction.
Sam Fisher need not apply.
Warpips will be available to download, free of charge, from Epic Games Store from February 16-23. Until the end of today, users still have the opportunity to bag themselves current freebie Recipe for Disaster.

The time has come for the peasants to revolt, as Ikki Unite has hit PC.
The original Ikki launched in arcades in 1985 and was quickly followed by a Nintendo Famicom version. The Famicom version is famous for being one of the first games to have had the title of “kusoge” (literal translation: crap game) bestowed upon it. The creation of the kusoge nomenclature has sometimes been attributed to Jun Miura writing about this game, but the origins are a little murky.
It seems like a strange game to return to, but in Japan, kusoge is more celebrated as a shared suffering experience. Ikki’s Famicom iteration actually sold quite well, which only solidified it in the minds of young games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, that includes Game Boy Color.
Well, it happened — Game Boy games are finally on the Nintendo Switch Online service. This is another one of those rumours that we've been hearing about for a good while now, and in february 2023, Nintendo just snapped its fingers and popped seven rather lovely classics onto NSO just like that.
Originally, the lovely people here at NL Towers got together in September 2021 to come up with some dream titles that we'd like to see on Game Boy NSO. Dream was the key, and we got a bit creative with some of our choices, and only one of them ended up being right — Link's Awakening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s probably not a huge surprise to say that Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment’s visually intriguing mystery set in 16th century Bavaria, required a lot of historical research during development. What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

The title is Ubisoft's latest effort to score a piece of the lucrative free-to-play pie, following on from unsuccessful ventures such as Roller Champions, Elite Squad, Hyper Scape, and canned endeavors Ghost Recon Frontline and Project Q.

Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you're making a very specific request. But it's one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it's bloody difficult.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring has spranged
Nintendo of Europe has announced via Twitter that the first wave of the previously announced Splatoon 3 DLC will arrive on February 28, 2023. Previously, Nintendo stated that this wave would arrive in Spring, and unless you listen to ground-dwelling marmots, that isn’t until late March.
The first of Splatoon 3’s paid DLC will be coming in two waves. As far as I can tell, this first wave contains the Inkopolis Plaza first seen in the original Splatoon. You’ll be able to see what’s happened in the past 7 or 8 Springs, catch up with the shopkeepers, and even see the Squid Sisters perform when Splatfest rolls around.

That’s cool. That’s weird. I’ve never really thought of a lobby as paid DLC material, but maybe this is just the appetizer. There’s a second wave that will be coming along eventually, and that includes a story campaign that involves Inkopolis Square, the Splatoon 2 hub. I’m going to assume that’s where the meat of this DLC is really going to be, but Nintendo hasn’t done a super-great job of communicating that. Hopefully, we’ll finally get the ability to play as Salmonids.
Splatoon 3 is available right now on Switch. The first wave of DLC hits February 28, 2023, with the second wave coming before the end of the year.

But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

[Update: The PowerWash Simulator Special Midgar Pack will launch on all platforms March 2, free to all players.]
In a very fun, and very surprising piece of news, goofy window-washer PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab has revealed that it is collaborating with Square Enix on a special Final Fantasy VII DLC expansion, which will see our crew of dirt-blasters head out to the city Midgar for some deep-cleaning action.
The new "Midgar Special Pack" DLC will give PowerWash Simulator players the opportunity to clean up some familiar locales and enemies located around the miserable, smog-covered 'berg, giving the iconic Final Fantasy VII cityscape a sparkly sheen not seen since before the arrival of capitalist scumbags Shinra. Tifa's bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud's motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona' and the devastating "Guard Scorpion" robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.
https://twitter.com/sqex_ee/status/1620252315969265665?s=20&t=0shT7d5tDKcJW45Xt5YSZg
Unfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated "Final Fantasy VII Day". We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available. In the meantime, you can still go and spruce up Croft Manor for yer gurl Lara.
PowerWash Simulator is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dwarven Vow #108: Let sleeping dogs lie.
Though it’s never quite had the popularity of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest franchises, the Tales series has set a good reputation as the ‘other’ classic JRPG series that’s consistently maintained a decent quality for quite some time now. Back in 2004, Namco (no Bandai yet) was only on the fifth iteration of the Tales series, which made the bold transition to full 3D with the release of Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube. Sporting an attractive cel-shaded visual style and packing enough content to last for hundreds of hours, there was a lot to love about this release back when the pickings were much slimmer for great RPGs on Nintendo consoles. Now, Tales of Symphonia Remastered--which is based on the 2013 PS3 rerelease, which in turn uses the PS2 Japan-exclusive version as a base--has brought the classic experience to modern hardware and while it still remains a charming adventure, it’s definitely showing its age.
The story is set in the land of Sylvarant, which is experiencing a bit of an ecological crisis. A critical shortage of mana caused by the lingering effects of a war from thousands of years back means that the world is itself dying, and time is running out fast for the inhabitants. The only hope is for the Regeneration to take place, in which a person dubbed “The Chosen” opens various seals across the land to awaken the goddess and return life to all things. You take the role of Lloyd, good friend of the current Chosen, Colette. Lloyd is the headstrong son of a dwarven smith, and after he inadvertently causes a terrible tragedy in his village, Lloyd sets out with his best friend Genis to accompany and protect their friend Colette on her journey to fulfill her Chosen duties and save the world from destruction.

Capcom has released a new trailer for the incoming PSVR2 edition of its blockbuster horror title Resident Evil Village. In addition, the publisher announced that a free demo will be made available alongside the hardware's launch, which will take place on February 22.
The VR adaptation of Resident Evil Village will see players going face to face with the horrors of The House Beneviento like never before. Fully immersive 3D technology is expected to bolster the forests, huts, castles, and corridors for maximum player impact, allowing hapless users to come face-to-face with a gallery of infamous and terrifying villains, including Heisenberg, Lady Dimitrescu, and, yes, that baby. No Thank You. Not unless it's the puppet versions... I'd hang out with them all day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCxmbavVqys&t=8s&ab_channel=ResidentEvil
The PlayStation VR 2 technology launches worldwide on February 22, and is hoping to set a new market standard for immersive, responsive, virtual reality hardware. While the technology is unquestionably impressive, the PSVR2 unit's exceptionally high price, ($550 USD), will most certainly make it something of a niche purchase within an already niche community. Still, how much do you want to pay for a date with Lady D? Can you put a price on what would surely be the best, and last, night of your life?
Resident Evil Village VR Mode will officially release later in 2023, available as a free download for all Resident Evil Village players.

Metroid's protagonist, Samus Aran, has a rather unique privilege in the world of Nintendo. Unlike characters like Mario, Link, and Kirby, all of whom retain the same general look across their respective franchises (okay, Link is a little more varied than the other two, but still), Samus' basic design can be altered quite drastically from game to game.
Granted, the character needs to remain relatively recognisable for fans, so you can't go nuts with this kind of thing, but when you examine Samus's overall suit design in each of the mainline Metroid games, it's surprisingly different in a lot of ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loathe as I am to become one of those "want to feel old?" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the "A New Era" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

Known for designing many of the series' iconic characters, all of the logos, and even providing illustrations after he stepped down from the role after Final Fantasy VI, Amano's work is beloved around the world. And StudioMDHR have collaborated with the artist, who has designed the jacket for the The Delicious Last Course's soundtrack jacket. The developer shared the work on Twitter, and to say it looks amazing is an understatement.

Back in 1999 Nintendo revealed a Super Smash Bros. marketing campaign which makes those "everyone is here" Ultimate trailers pale in comparison. The company hosted an event called Super Smash Bros. Slamfest '99 and it saw the likes Pikachu, Donkey Kong, Mario and Yoshi take to the ring in a wrestling match in front of a live audience.
The event took place in Las Vegas on 24th April 1999, where the crowd could watch their childhood video game idols beat each other up before their very eyes. Basically, the event sounds insane, and until today we had seen very little of it thanks to the woes of film photography and 1990s streaming practices.

Nintendo has announced that Wave 1 of Splatoon 3's Expansion Pass will launch on 28th February. This follows last week's details during the Nintendo Direct.

Somebody deserves a whole stack of lollipops — PlatinumGames has proudly announced that its dazzling hack 'n' slash sequel Bayonetta 3 has smashed past one million global sales. The long-long-long awaited sequel first launched on Nintendo Switch back in October 2022.
The sales milestone was modestly announced on the official PlatinumGames Twitter account, and sees the popular series' second sequel become the fastest-selling title of the Bayonetta series. The adventure sees the sultry Umbra Witch take on the powerful "Homunculi" arsenal in an effort to prevent the very tearing of space and time itself. Over the course of the story, Bayonetta is aided by friends from alternate universes, as well as a young witch-in-training known as Viola.

After what seemed like an endless wait for release, Bayonetta 3 finally launched to a mixed, but mostly positive reception from critics and fans. While most everybody was pleased with the iconic and chaotic combat, as well as its seamless integration into the mise-en-scene, many fans were left a little disappointed by the story and the overall character arc for their favorite naughty spellcaster.
The next title in the series will be spin-off release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon. This cutesy-looking title will see the young girl who would eventually become Bayonetta embark upon one of her very first adventures, exploring the Avalon forest alongside her first demon companion, Cheshire. Bayonetta Origins will launch on Nintendo Switch on March 17.
Bayonetta 3 is available right now, exclusively on Nintendo Switch.

I know what you're thinking, the difference between a remaster and a remake is clear. A game like Wind Waker HD is a remaster and Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake. Wind Waker retained the same skeleton as the original but overhauled the graphics. Essentially being 90% the same game. Whereas Resident Evil 2 was a full reimagining of the original game.

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

While rumors that had been swirling for years pointed to the likelihood of a port of 2009’s Metroid Prime Trilogy, Nintendo surprised us by dropping Metroid Prime Remastered instead. This is entirely unlike Nintendo for a few reasons. Mostly, it’s because Metroid Prime Remastered isn’t just a port. They actually went to the effort of gussying up to the nines. Weirder yet, they aren’t charging some sort of premium for it or even full price. Sometimes they pretend that Metroid doesn’t even exist. Is this a mistake?
In any case, I love Metroid Prime. The GameCube had a lot of momentum coming out of the gate, giving fans a lot to draw their focus away from what was happening on other platforms. Metroid Prime dropped in North America, exactly one year after the continent got the cons…]]></summary>

Global baseball aficionados can finally experience the excitement of Konami's cutesy release WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros, which is now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. This release — announced during last week's Nintendo Direct presentation — marks the official debut of the long-running franchise on the international stage for the first time since its 1994 inception.
eBaseball: Power Pros, officially recognized by The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WSBC) is a scaled-down version of the classic sport, featuring simple-to-learn controls, adorable chibi characters, and a huge roster of 300 characters. Form your team, take to the diamond, and become the most famous baseball team on the planet.

Alternately, multiplayer support allows for up to four players to team up for online and offline action, battering up for some friendly competition, or entering online tournaments via the new Championship Mode. Wade through the statistics of the title's mammoth roster to ensure that you synergize the best pitchers, catchers, batters, and backstops in the business. For such a tiny title, WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros looks to have a pretty big personality.
Best of all, it will cost interested parties very little to get in on the action. WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros is currently available from PSN and the Nintendo eShop for a single dollar (though some global markets will have to abide by their territory's "minimum pricing" laws). So it won't break the bank to get you and your pals out and into the dugout. Swing, batter, batter, batter, batter...

Zelink might be one of the biggest ships out there, and it's hardly controversial to want Zelda and Link, the two owners of the Triforce that aren't evil, to end up together. They're entwined in destiny, fated to keep meeting, and falling into the princess/hero dichotomy that keeps them separate once more. And yet, they've never really had a romantic relationship. It's wild!
We're big Zelink shippers here at NL, of course, so we've created the ultimate list of the best Zelda/Link relationships as represented in the Legend of Zelda games. We've skipped a few of the games — notably spin-offs like Hyrule Warriors and Four Swords — but all the mainline games are here.

I haven’t done much diving into deck-builders, which seems to be riding the trend wave in the indie market. I’m honestly not sure why, since every time I’ve interacted with one, I’ve enjoyed it. Take, for example, Mahokenshi.
I tried the demo of Mahokenshi a long while back and came away impressed, yet somehow the final release still snuck up on me. Its mix of board-game style, turn-based, card-centric gameplay felt rather powerful in my first experience, so I was excited to see how the whole package turned out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White plains.
The notion of two disparate species of animals coming together to help one another is not particularly new in the world of storytelling. The trope goes all the way back to the likes of Peter Rabbit, in which our intrepid titular hero enlists the assistance of Squirrel Nutkin to help fend off the dastardly fox, Mr. Tod. It’s a concept that just works and is immediately endearing to both children and adults; so it’s no wonder, then, that Blanc resonated with so many upon its initial reveal. But does the actual gameplay hold up? Mostly, but with some important caveats.
Blanc stars two playable characters — a wolf cub and a fawn — both of whom have been inadvertently cut off from their respective families during a sudden snowstorm. As the two try to get their bearings, they run into each other over two sides of a frozen river, and ultimately decide to help each other return to their parents and siblings. Considering there’s absolutely no dialogue in Blanc, developer Casus Ludi has done a remarkable job in communicating exactly what’s going on with the two main characters in question, despite the admittedly simplistic plot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.

Mick Gordon, the composer for Mundfish’s upcoming FPS, Atomic Heart, has announced that he will be donating the fees her received for scoring the game to the Austrailian Red Cross' Ukraine Crisis Appeal for use in their humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.
[embed]https://twitter.com/Mick_Gordon/status/1625495826247319556?s=20[/embed]
The announcement is significant as it comes following the concern that developer Mundfish is allegedly supported by investors with hands in Russia’s war in Ukraine; or that funds from Atomic Heart’s sales may directly help the Russian government. While Mundfish is based in Cyprus, there have been allegations that it's mainly headquartered in Moscow.
Moreover, the studio allegedly has investors that have relations with Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. While nothing has been directly proven, a lot of allegations have been brought up, and Mundfish hasn’t exactly stepped in to set the record straight itself, stating that it simply does “not comment on politics.”
While Mick Gordon has not specifically commented on these accusations, this move is at least one that may help offset some of the concerns. However, it’s not the same as if Mundfish itself donated proceeds to aid Ukraine. I would encourage you to do your own research into Mundfish’s connection with the war in Ukraine, reach your own conclusions, and decide for yourself if purchasing Atomic Heart is reasonably moral for you.
Mick Gordon has scored titles such as Wolfenstein: The New Order, Killer Instinct, and Doom Eternal. Atomic Heart is available February 21 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.

Xbox has confirmed that the launch of its hugely successful Xbox Game Pass subscription service has had a notable negative impact on the long-term sales prospects of many of the titles added to its rotating catalog of games.
The admission comes as part of a report by The UK Competition and Markets Authority, (as seen by GamesIndustry.biz) which was commissioned as part of Microsoft's proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard. According to the report, many titles that were made temporarily available in the Game Pass service then saw a decline in physical/digital sales for the 12-month period following their removal from the service.
The average percentage by which sales have declined was redacted from the record.

The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo's in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is a man? A miserable pile of smooches!
It might be Valentine’s Day, but we’re going to have to wait a bit longer for that love blood to hit the water. The Deep End Games and 2124 Publishing has announced that Romancelvania, their unholy cross-breed of Metroidvania and dating sim, will be hitting the bedsheets March 7, 2023.
Romancelvania introduces us to a Dracula whose confidence is still laid up after a savage beating at the hands of the Van Helsing clan. Their lover left them, their minions don’t respect them, and evil just doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. Death gets fed up with this pity party and sets Dracula up with their own dating show. It’s time to choose from 12 “lucky” singles and help the dark lord (or lady) get their mojo back. Peer pressure is the proven way to turn a spark into a flame.
[embed]https://youtu.be/-iJkv94HlBA[/embed]
Gameplay is a clever combination of gated exploration and choice-driven dialogue. You’re given the option to choose a body type, and the dating options cover whatever it is you’re into, whether you’re more a Medusa or werewolf kind of person. The whole affair is fully voiced, which is an appreciated bit of extra effort.
It feels like simultaneously forever and not that long ago that I played the demo and came away impressed but skeptical. The whole concept seems like it will be extremely difficult to get right, given the amount of player agency available and the two disparate genres that are trying to be married. However, nothing about the demo implied that The Deep End Games is in over the depth, so provided the rest of the game matches the bar set by the earlier peek we got, then we’re in for a real treat.
Romancelvania is out on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 7.

Are you still recovering from Metroid Prime Remastered's surprise announcement and release? Well, how about some more detailed analysis on Retro Studios and Iron Galaxy's stellar rerelease from the team over at Digital Foundry?
Comparing the new Switch release to both the GameCube and Wii titles, Digital Foundry has given the game a pretty glowing overview, while also pointing out a few minor quibbles. And we really do mean minor. The game runs at a consistent 60fps according to Digital Foundry's tests in both handheld and docked, no matter how chaotic the screen gets, while resolution is at 900p on the big screen and 600p on a Switch screen. But it looks stunning on an OLED, all thanks to the game's improved lighting.

This week sees the launch of Electronic Arts period-piece adventure Wild Hearts, the mythical action-RPG set within the age of feudal Japan — Developer Omega Force, of Dynasty Warriors fame, has released a new trailer introducing players to the village and people of Minato, located deep within the beautiful overworld known as Azuma.
Wild Hearts will present players will a fresh take on the... well... the Monster Hunting genre that has proven especially popular in recent years. The player will take up the mantle of a custom hunter, and team with the people of Minato on a quest to track and defeat a menagerie of behemoth beasts known as "The Kemono" — utilizing each creature's soulful "Celestial Thread" in order to renovate and rebuild the province of Azuma before it is lost completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grFGQ2oWUQ&t
As you can see from the trailer above, Wild Hearts will boast some amazing and awe-inspiring creature designs, while offering up a selection of varied weaponry, gear, and elemental skills in order to aid our hunters in their battles with these incredible land gods. From the village of Minato, the player will enlist the help of various arts, from alchemists to healers, blacksmiths to guides, in order to best prepare for the long and hazardous journeys that lie ahead.
Hone finely crafted skills of the "Karakuri" in order to build a variety of environmental traps and defenses, and experiment with a wide arsenal of weapons in order to best equip you and your party for the hunt. And looking at some of the monsters on display in this preview, you're probably going to need all of the help you can get. I mean, I'd come with you, but I've got a bit of a bad back. There in spirit, though.
Wild Hearts launches February 17 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Be sure to check out our own Chris Carter's initial thoughts in his Review-in-Progress.

It's one of those classic, age-old moments where you're suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that's still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda's oeuvre in all the right ways.

That's the offer of Dire Decks, a cute little arcade shmup which you can play for free right now in your browser on Itch.io. As you face down endless enemies, you draw and play cards representing individual attacks and power-ups, drafting new and more powerful cards as you level up. I dig it! In another time, this might have been a wee hit Flash game on Newgrounds.

The sequence comes around an hour into the story and lasts approximately 95 seconds. Lieutenant Hannah Stone, freshly showered from another terrible, violent day on the job, walks into the cafeteria of her headquarters for dinner. At the counter, she is handed fish soup, Bratwurst curry with potatoes, a blackcurrant jelly, and a steaming cup of coffee. Well earned.
Taking a seat at an empty table, Hannah stares at the bowl. Atop her soup is a severed fish head. It stares at her. Hannah looks it in the eye, which peers back into her soul. Hollow. Unblinking. Accusing. Hannah discards the soup to one side, where even a hungry cat decides not to partake in the free meal. Picking up her fork, Hannah stabs it into the bratwurst, or at least attempts to, as the cutle…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, "It's a no from me".

As Illumination continues to ramp up the marketing campaign for its upcoming release The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the studio has released a series of character posters spotlighting the Mushroom Kingdom and the heroes and villains that reside within.
The posters are strikingly attractive, packed out with color and dynamism, and see protagonists such as Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Peach headed out to battle with the likes of Donkey Kong, Shy Guy, Magikoopa, and, of course, Big Bad Bowser himself. Each poster spotlights a particular character and world — from Rainbow Road, to Donkey Kong Island, to Bowser's Castle — with each image hoping to get fans' hype engines suitably in gear for the movie's spring release.
https://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1624136305297981440?s=20&t=U6IBLXcUhvcEqQ_ibx5mlw
I think my favorite is Peach ridin' the Rainbow Road, I love the bright colours and the wild perspective. The drama of the Bowser's Army image is also top-tier. The poster which sees Peach, Toad, and Mario all sat admiring the Mushroom Kingdom is quite lovely. A text-free version of that would look great on the wall of any video game fan.
Take a look at the posters in the tweets below and see which is your pick of the bunch.
Mario
Luigi
Peach
Toad
Bowser
Donkey Kong
Group Shot
Mushroom Kingdom
Bowser's Army
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), Seth Rogan (Donkey Kong), and Charlie Day (Luigi). It is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7.
Oh, and be sure to check out the easter-egg-filled Super Bowl ad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

I swear, if it weren't for the smattering of autumnal trees in the tutorial level, its grassy plains, tall mountains and bright blue river would have been a dead ringer for Okami's Kamiki Village.

On February 12, 2023, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn posted a cryptic tweet featuring nothing but a plain wall with a sticky note attached to it. Seemingly uneventful, right? Well, not exactly. That sticky note promised a "State of the Game" post on Bungie's website for the following day consisting of no less than 5,300 words, covering Destiny 2 Lightfall and the year ahead.
For those new to these articles, every now and then the Destiny developer team will share a blog on the state of the game, the future as they see it, and changes coming to future expansions. Generally speaking, these blog posts come about once every year or two, have plenty of detail, the contents are rarely if ever leaked, and it usually spells exciting new directions for the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please insert credits
Metroid Prime Remastered shadow-dropped as part of last week's Nintendo Direct. And while players have been enjoying the refreshed version of Samus' adventure, some developers are calling out issues with credits for the work on both Metroid Prime Remastered and its origins.
Former Prime developer Zoid Kirsch shared this screenshot of the credits over the weekend, which uses a blanket phrase to credit the teams that worked on both Metroid Prime and its Wii version.
"While many studios did amazing work on the remaster, I'm letdown Metroid Prime's Remaster does not include the full original game credits," said Kirsch. "I worked with so many amazing people on the game and everyone's name should be included in the remaster, not just a single card like this."
You can see the credits for yourself in uploaded game completion VODs like this one. Though it attributes Retro staff, as well as Airship Images Limited, Gamesim, Iron Galaxy Studios, and others who worked on the project, it does close with one solitary block for the original GameCube game and the Wii version.
Former developer Jack Mathews called it a travesty, not just for his own work on the original that could have been replaced, but for others' that may have stuck through to the final remaster.
The credits issue in games
Games have, historically, had issues with crediting the work developers have done on them. Reports at sites like Kotaku have highlighted how credit for contributions have been used as both rewards and punitive measures.
Metroid as a series even encountered this with Dread, as several developers claimed they weren't credits for their work on the project. Other developers have also seen accusations of withholding credits.

Destiny 2: Lightfall is set to release on February 28, 2023, and Guardians globally are preparing their characters for the penultimate DLC in the Destiny Light and Dark saga from Bungie. There are multiple ways to do this, and over the years many have discovered the optimal way to ensure they head into Lightfall with the best jump-start possible.

I first heard of Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken on Game Centre CX where it was introduced as “kyuukyoku no kusoge” or “ultimate crappy game.” The host, Shinya Arino, tackled it as part of a segment that ran throughout 9 of the 10 episodes of season 3 (2005). The concept of the segment is that he’d try to tackle the game, and every time he’d get stuck or confused, he’d call a viewer to get hints on what to do.
He was eventually able to complete the game, but Super Monkey Daibouken is so incomprehensible that, in one of the episodes, he made absolutely no progress, and none of the viewers could help him.
I decided that I’d try that out for myself. Obviously, no one views me (that I know of), so my goal was to complete the game using the same viewer hints that Arino…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a lot of Double Fine's games, but none as much as I like the documentary which charted the development of Broken Age. I can't get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.

It was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I've had a great time watching the first three so far.

Instead, two PrimeStreams-related lawsuits worth tens of millions in damages were quietly settled this week, despite what appeared to be a mountain of evidence. So what went wrong?

It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the 'correct' solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

Speaking pedantically, this isn't "as simple as it gets", but you'll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I've played enough to realise I'm partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Division 2 has enjoyed a long life since its 2019 release, but it seems like the looter shooter has finally tripped. Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt.

      <p>WWE 2K23 arrives on March 17, and 2K Games spent the last couple of weeks rolling out roster reveals to build hype. If you haven’t been keeping up with the parade of new and returning faces competing in the squared circle this year, 2K has now finished up the reveals by posting the complete roster at launch. While post-launch DLC will add more faces throughout the year, here's the full list of the superstars available in the game on day one, with characters available in launch-day DLC packs noted as such.   </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I imagine Industries Of Titan started out as an ambitious concept. A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it's incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

It's meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Katharine and I were lamenting earlier today that Square Enix seem inconsistent when it comes to releasing demos of their games on Steam. Forspoken's demo only came to PC months after its console release, and Harvestella's demo remains exclusive to Switch. Likewise, the Octopath Traveler 2 demo which was released on console yesterday was nowhere to be found on PC.

Uh, until today. It's out on Steam now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Razer's Nari Essential headset is a nice wireless option, with oversized and super-comfy ear cushions, a THX spatial audio certification and a relatively sturdy design. It retailed at $100, half the price of the ultra-premium Nari Ultimate, but today it's significantly cheaper at Best Buy. You'll pay just $35 for it now, a $65 discount and a great deal for an older but still great-sound wireless headset.

Six months of patches and performance improvements later, and these GPUs look even better - especially as neither AMD or Nvidia has launched mainstream desktop graphics cards from their most recent generation. 
 Today, the cheaper of the two cards, the Arc A750, is available for £250 plus shipping at Overclockers UK, a steep £80 reduction from their £330 launch price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot (most) of the magic games we're highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It's nice that witches have changed in our minds to "unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]", when they used to be "unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil".
There's still room for witches with some threat to 'em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. "In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits," solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. "During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one's home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been busy here at RPS picking out our favourite demos in this spring’s Steam Next Fest. Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.
I thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it's actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain's Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.

That was a mistake, since their newest story-focused adventure Harmony: The Fall Of Reverie looks amazing. Best of all, it’s coming to PC and consoles this June.

"Unlaunching" this GPU, rebranding it, and releasing it for £100 / $100 less may have bruised egos at Nvidia, but at least it’s left us with an intriguing silicone prospect. Finally, there’s a high-end, DLSS 3-capable, Ada Lovelace architecture-based graphics card that doesn’t cost four figures.

      <p>Professor Layton is making a comeback in a new adventure for Switch. Called Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, the next chapter in his saga will arrive at a yet-to-be-specified date.</p>

<p>A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don't know what mystery he'll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it's nice to see the good gentleman back.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Nintendo announced a new Samba de Amigo game today&nbsp;during its most recent Direct live stream.&nbsp;Samba de Amigo: Party Central will be released this summer.</p>

<p>Party Central will feature 40 songs "from across the world’s most popular music genres." Players use the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con controllers in rhythm with the beat. The game will also have local and online competitive multiplayer and party modes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

      <p>During today's Nintendo Direct presentation, we saw plenty of new footage of one of the most anticipated games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While you can read all about that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/new-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-trailer-shows-vehicles-homing">right here</a>, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017's Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector's Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.</p>

<p>Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon got its first gameplay showcase after its reveal at the Game Awards last December. This storybook-themed adventures stars a young Bayonetta on a quest to free her imprisoned mother.</p>

<p>Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is&nbsp;still a witch-in-training so she won't be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she'll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're going to immediately jump past this paragraph&nbsp;to the trailer below, so&nbsp;here are&nbsp;the quick bits you need to know: there's rail&nbsp;grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the trailer:</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave&nbsp;4, which is targeting a release later this spring.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave&nbsp;4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>After months of rumors, Nintendo announced that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are coming to the Switch online libraries. Best of all, both handheld offerings are available today.</p>

<p>These classic titles now support both local and online play (with friends only). Game Boy games will be available on the standard Nintendo Switch Online subscription tier. The library will grow over time, but today players can check out the following:</p>

      <p>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/22/advance-wars-12-re-boot-camp-delayed-to-2022" target="_blank">pushed</a> to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn't happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay "in light of recent world events," perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games&nbsp;Advance Wars&nbsp;and&nbsp;Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It's being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.</p>]]></summary>

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-messenger/a-tale-of-two-games" target="_blank">The Messenger</a> is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Sea of Stars&nbsp;features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Check out the new trailer below.</p>

      <p>The long-rumored Metroid Prime Switch remaster is finally real – and it will be available digitally today. It will be available physically on February 22.</p>

<p>The trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.</p>

<p>The trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.</p>

      <p>2011's Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective rises from the dead and will possess the Switch, along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, this summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news comes by way of today's Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It's up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Nintendo leveraged today’s Nintendo Direct as a chance to provide a new glimpse at Pikmin 4. Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.</p>

<p>Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.</p>

      <p>Nintendo announced today plans for a paid expansion pass for Splatoon 3. The first of two planned waves will be available spring of this year. It will allow players to hang out in Inkopolis from the original Splatoon game, and even meet and interact with characters from the original game, like the Squid Sisters, who will perform during Splat Fests.</p>

<p>No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.</p>

      <p>"Honestly speaking, I didn't want to do it."</p>

<p>Those were the words of Capcom's Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the…]]></summary>

It's a chill, citybuilding puzzle game from the devs behind the altogether more violent Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and it's all about building tiny little villages on top of rocky outcrops. Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.

      <p>Ever since the first bundle&nbsp;arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.</p>

<p>Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don't know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles&nbsp;in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.</p>

<p>On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.</p>

<p>The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It's a fantastic little game, and I'm only sorry we didn't cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends is going to look a little different in a week's time. Respawn have broken the mould a little bit with Apex Legends Revelry and the game's four year anniversary - instead of adding a new Legend as usual, they've spent their time elsewhere to bring a host of Legend meta and weapon meta changes, alongside the new Team Deathmatch game mode and improving player onboarding that we reported on earlier in the week.
Apex Legends Season 16 is going to break a surprising number of targeted adjustments to various different guns, Legends, and abilities. And all that on top of the entirely revamped Legend class system, which gives every Legend a brand new perk (or in some cases two!) to play with. Read on for a full list of all the major changes that are coming to Legends and weapons with Apex Legends Revelry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Steam Next Fest, I gave pixel-art, sidescrolling fantasy RPG Greedventory a go. It takes your mouse and turns it into a sword, or a shield, or an arm that's capable of swatting away an explosive potion. It may be like something you, dear reader, have played in the past, but me? Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that's a lie. If anything, it's the first fantasy RPG that's made use of my latent - and highly dubious - CS:GO skills and brought to mind a rhythm game called Osu! I am very impressed indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have released their provisional findings on Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, laying out their concerns with the $69 billion deal. The CMA say the buyout “could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers.” Since these concerns are provisional, both parties will have a chance to respond before the CMA makes its final decision on April 26th. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.

It’s a 19th-century witch sim being made by Emberstorm Entertainment, where you play as a traveling witch whose chosen mode of transportation is the legendary chicken-legged Baba Yaga house, which is the coolest thing ever.

Details on Reka are still super light, and the Steam page mentions a release year of 2024, but I’ve been following Emberstorm’s Twitter intently, looking at all the cool gifs for Reka and the house looks incredible! For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.

      <p>To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between tax returns, terrible weather, and rank Tory corruption, 2023's opening act has put me in a right foul mood. So foul, in fact, that I could quite happily kill something (in a game). I want to hack something to death, with sharp implements in some sort of virtual environment. Oh, what's this hiding down the back of the sofa? Why, it's Blade And Sorcery, a VR game about hacking people to death in a virtual environment. How fortunate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know, I always figured I’d be great at making potions. As a kid, I was obsessed with pulling things out of cupboards and combining them into a bowl. Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. 


As I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I finished the free Tomb Raider DLC for PowerWash Simulator, in which you pressure-blast scum off Lara Croft's ancestral home. It's a great DLC, not just because it has loads of nods to the older Tomb Raider games, but also because if you're just in it for the powerwashing, you've got some lovely levels to clean, with nooks and crannies and satisfying walls to scour. My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.

      <p>Hogwarts Legacy is prepping for release on February 10, but the provided review code allowed for a review embargo that was lifted earlier today. After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.</p>

<p>In that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story …]]></summary>

      <p>After spending a couple of years coming together in early access, Darkest Dungeon II is ready to go 1.0 this May. Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by&nbsp;downloading a free demo today.</p>

<p>Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen&nbsp;heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.</p>

<p>Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two&nbsp;full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2023-02-03</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

      <p>The remake of Resident Evil 4 is <em>Game Informer</em>’s cover story for February, and as part of our ongoing features, we’re sharing extended footage of the game’s fifth chapter, set right after Leon meets Ashley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I, Marcus Stewart, and video editor Alex Van Aken played this chapter at Capcom’s headquarters for our cover story. You'll get a great look at the section we played as well as our commentary for added context. The footage includes extended looks at the church and cemetery sequences, a demonstration of&nbsp;combat and exploration, capping off with a larger slice of the chaotic cabin battle with Luis Serra.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Since the remake of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ResidentEvil4" target="_blank">Resident Evil 4 graces <em>Game Informer</em>’s cover</a> this month, we thought it’d be fitting to revisit the game that kicked off Capcom’s remake craze: Resident Evil 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019&nbsp;to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.</p>
