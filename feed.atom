        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Life is Strange series is hailed for its impressive storytelling, iconic characters, and emotional impact. From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline. 


Not counting Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which is due to come out later this year, the Life is Strange series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the Life is Strange games in chronological order.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

Now that The Dark Ages has been announced, id Software's iconic series is once again in the public eye.


Although, it never really stopped being part of the wider gaming conversation. As a series, Doom has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it's stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.

Clive’s journey to liberate the oppressed magic-weiding Bearers of Valisthea and cleanse the world of the spreading Blight won me over with its earnest and lovable characters, flashy and frenetic fights, serene and grandiose soundscapes, and the titanic, cinematic boss battles that are simply unforgettable.


But for all of its many achievements, Final Fantasy XVI felt a bit simple and underdeveloped at times. A number of design choices seem derived from the developer’s previous experience with Final Fantasy XIV, while other elements fail to meet the same complexity and variety as its MMO counterpart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil developer Capcom recently announced that it will bring the seventh entry in its iconic series, Resident Evil Biohazard, to all Apple devices with an M1 chip or better. For Mac laptops, that means any Mac Book Air or Mac Book Pro from late 2020 onwards will be able to run the game.


However, this isn’t the first time Capcom has released a Mac and iOS port for the Resident Evil series. The current Mac Resident Evil games are essentially a dedicated showcase of just how powerful the M-series chips and integrated graphics cards can be, especially on devices such as the Mac Book Air, which don’t have a fan. 


Resident Evil Games for Mac Available Now


Mac and iPhone users can currently purchase both Resident Evil Village and the Resident Evil 4 remake via their device’s App Store. Resident Evil Village on Mac in particular is a spectacle to behold; I can personally vouch for its impressive performance on the M1 Mac Book Air. While there have been a few audio glitches here and there, the port is exceptionally well optimized.

The Resident Evil 4 remake on M1 devices also has generally positive reviews on the Mac App Store, though users should note that you’ll need approximately 125 GB of free space on your drive to install the game, which is nearly double the listed size requirement in the store. 


Upcoming Resident Evil Games for Mac


The Resident Evil Biohazard Mac and iOS port is currently slated for July 2nd, 2024. However, Capcom has also announced on its Apple games page that it will be bringing the Resident Evil 2 remake to all M-series Apple devices as well. We don’t have a release date for this one yet, but if the previous Mac Resident Evil ports are anything to go by, it’s sure to be an exceptional experience.

Through fan art that usually shows memes or epic landscapes, players are instead highlighting those they fight for in the Helldivers universe. 


Usually, Major Orders are little more than flavor text that justifies playing more Helldivers 2. Yes, they add to the story, but the gameplay is what we're all here for, and if we can make it into just one more mission by shouting, "Won't someone please think of the children?!" then we're absolutely going to do it. Right now, though, Helldivers 2 players are experiencing a more somber mood, sharing artwork that commemorates the children and civilians they save on a daily basis, not just in the recent Major Order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve become very accustomed to seeing new Paldeck videos released by Palworld every weekend, but the one released on June 15 is slightly different. Rather than showcasing a Pal we’ve come to know, they showed off a Pal that we’ve yet to meet — Chillet Ignis. 




Chillet has become a huge fan favorite among players. The original Ice type Pal is a fluffy looking Dragon capable of inflicting huge damage, all while looking cute, and the Ignis variant is no different. 


Chillet Ignis looks like someone took the original Chillet and turned up the color temperature, which is apt, because as a Fire type this Pal is likely to bring the heat. Apparently, Chillet Ignis is capable of spinning so fast it will emit sparks, so it might be best to give this one a wide berth until it warms up to you. Pun intended. 


The Alpha Chillet Ignis shown in the Paldeck video is a level 52, which is an exciting reminder that more levels are coming when the Sakurajima update arrives on June 27. This is excellent news to anyone like myself, who has taken a break through a lack of levels to climb or new content to experience. 


We’re usually given two Paldeck videos each weekend, so the next should release tomorrow. The sneak peak at the end of the Chillet Ignis video shows another much loved Pal, despite the fact that it’s not even in the game yet — Croajiro, the small frog armed with a stick.

From plushes to figurines, clothing and even terrifying nightmare fuel, if you look hard enough you’ll be able to find everything Palworld related, but none of it is official merch. 


Posting on Twitter this morning, Pocketpair has assured that there is indeed some official merchandise on the way, if fans can wait a just little longer to get their hands on it. 




Accompanying this plea was a purposefully faded image of a Cattiva plush, giving fans something to get excited about. However, the comments were mostly focused on fans asking for their favorite Pal in plush form - although a staggering lack of those are after a Depresso plush, I must say.

Anthology for the Killer is a compilation of nine previously available, completely absurd, short-form horror titles that have decided, as many of us have, that reality really sucks.

As part of Shovel Knight's 10th anniversary celebrations, Yacht Club Games will be going back to where it started, with the original game Shovel of Hope - only this time it's getting the 'DX' treatment! You might remember a few titles of yesteryear getting the same treatment after their initial run and now we've got Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX.
This is a new "enhanced edition" of Shovel Knight's adventure that started it all. Apart from Steam, no other platforms have been confirmed (but a Nintendo release seems highly likely given the series' history) and we don't have a release date just yet, but we do know that it's "coming soon", so hopefully there's not long to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 24, 2024, the controversial third season of Fortnite Chapter 5 launched, thrusting players into a frenzied and chaotic map. A portion of it has been overtaken by a desolate post-apocalyptic wasteland occupied by sparse thrown-together structures. Players don't want to be caught traversing it on foot, either, seeing as massive weapon-equipped vehicles of all varieties roam the landscape. It's all very much Mad Max-inspired, and yet, there's no Mad Max tie-in to be seen.


The very same day Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 kicked off, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga released in theaters. After ages of development, the story of Mad Max: Fury Road's favorite Imperator Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) was told on the big screen. Thus, it seemed like an opportune time to add some Mad Max franchise skins to …]]></summary>

You also get to meet some interesting characters, and there are titles up for grabs as well. 


Before you can even begin to think about undertaking Custom Deliveries, you’ll need to unlock Collectables and the Scrip Exchange. This starts at level fifty with Inscrutable Tastes, and additional ongoing quests become available as you level up. These further quests unlock more inventory and higher-level collectible appraisers in different expansion locations. 


Here’s the list of quests and which level you need to be to unlock them, as well as what they unlock:

Fortunately, a growing number of fantasy books written specifically for younger readers are helping to bridge that gap.


Young adult fantasy books existed before I was even a glimmer in my parent's eyes, but they started to gain popularity around the time I started seriously getting into reading. Nowadays, YA fantasy isn't a niche; it's one of the most popular subgenres of literary fantasy, so I'm here to tell you about the top 15 best books for YA fantasy enthusiasts.

Originally published in 2008, Dixit is a perennial favorite as a gentle board game with beautiful art and appealing aesthetics that manages to remain fun and relevant without ever becoming too complicated for new players. Players take turns choosing a card from their hand of fanciful picture cards, describe it with a word or very short phrase, and then every other player also chooses a card from their hand that they feel matches that phrase. The chosen cards are shuffled together and players have to decide which they think was the original card. It sounds easy, but the tric…]]></summary>

I won’t go too deep into the details, as there is a lot of lore surrounding every single member of the Convocation. Consider this a TLDR to bring you up to speed with who we’ve met, who we haven’t and who we may meet in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fashionably late.
Yes, yes - we know Nintendo Switch is old now. There comes a time in each console's life when the games start to dry up and we look to the future — and the Switch is very much in the autumn of its years. Back in May, two months into its eighth year, Nintendo said a new hardware announcement is coming at some point before April next year, and with that acknowledgement comes a sense that the really good stuff will be saved to launch the next console with a bang.
However, looking back at past Nintendo systems, it doesn't necessarily mean Switch will be running on fumes for the rest of the year. You would have been forgiven for thinking Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the Switch's last hurrah, and then Super Mario Bros. Wonder turned up. You may have thought the release of Switch in 2017 meant that the might 3DS' days of quality exclusive software were numbered, but as we'll highlight below, that wasn't the case. In fact, Nintendo has good form when it comes to putting out brilliant games at the very end of a console's lifecycle and having sold over 140 million Switches, there's a high chance that there's still gold in them first-party hills, as well as all the third-party stuff we already know about.

Originating in the Greyhawk setting, Vecna has proven to be such a popular villain that his influence has extended to the Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft and even other media like Stranger Things. For DnD's 50th anniversary, it seems only fitting that this world-spanning campaign book, Vecna: Eve of Ruin, puts the Arch-Lich front and centre.


Eve of Ruin is a campaign that takes characters from levels 10 to 20 where the majority of published campaigns focus on lower-level characters. While starting at 10 might be less accessible, it does give Dungeon Masters a great opportunity to work with some of the higher-level monsters. For playe…]]></summary>

That didn’t worry me as I headed off into the depths of space – I was borrowing my brother’s copy of the game, anyway. I figured I’d fly for a few hours until, like apparently everyone else had, I got bored and then returned the game.

Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have used the format of the Soulslike and thrown in Metroidvania-styled exploration, while also doubling down on a parry mechanic despite being released before Sekiro. 


Still, despite the popularity of Soulslikes, it has not felt like enough games have taken inspiration from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Many fans of From Software's games, as well as those who simply appreciate a well-made video game with fleshed-out combat mechanics, tend to refer to it as a masterpiece.

The statue arrives less than a week ahead of the game's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which promises to add a colossal new area and twist on its gameplay mechanics.

Warning, spoilers for Doctor Who Season 14, Episode 7, The Legend of Ruby Sunday, follow.


I have to admit, The Legend of Ruby Sunday could well be the best episode of the season so far, but that’s not saying much considering we’ve had two ‘Doctor-lite’ episodes and a string of stand-alone stories. However, as opposed to previous episodes, this one feels quintessentially Whovian in the best way, so let’s get into the bones of what happened. 


Thankfully, the episode does indeed put Susan Twist’s character in a much bigger spotlight…]]></summary>

To help you answer that, as well as find a new title to fall in love with, here are the 10 best sports manga of all time, ranked. 


10. Blue Lock

Demographic: Shonen


Status: Ongoing


Is it officially available in English? Yes



Blue Lock's over-the-top narrative style and novel approach to the competitive mindset within football (or soccer, if you prefer) earned it a spot on our list. The latter makes the manga feel way more like a battle shonen. But don't get me wr…]]></summary>

Viewers were immediately introduced to the name of the fifth set of the TCG: Shimmering Skies. Since a VOD of the stream wasn’t saved, we’ll provide a thorough recap of everything revealed for the new Shimmering Skies set.


For those unfamiliar with Lorecast, Ravensburger held their inaugural Lorecast back in March to reveal Ursula’s Return. The stream treats viewers to a well-crafted cinematic that introduces the theme, and notable characters of the upcoming set, and then showcases many exciting card and product reveals.

Then came the deconstruction phase and building your own unique creations. Now, you're an adult with adult money, and Lego is preying on your nostalgia and fandoms to generate revenue. 


The following are 10 of the best Lego sets for adults. This list, understandably, is subjective. I've based it on kits my wife and I have assembled. So, while the Lego Millennium Falcon and Eiffel Tower are out there, I can't attest to their quality as I've not had the pleasure of building them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 7 of My Hero Academia is already in full swing, and it's doing a good job portraying the series' final saga. It not only gives the spotlight to the main cast but also to the side characters. It highlights the importance of teamwork, especially the vital roles that the supporting characters play


As a matter of fact, Neito Monoma absolutely dominated the entirety of episode 6. He played the vital role of copying Kurogiri's Quirk to bring the heroes together, a la Doctor Strange, and then used the very same Quirk to separate the League's main members. After that, he copied Eraser Head's Erasure Quirk to debuff Shigaraki, giving those facing the villain a fighting chance. So, how exactly does this Copy Quirk of his work?


As its name suggests, Monoma's Copy Quirk lets him duplicate another character's Quirk and use them as he sees fit. The only prerequisite is for Monoma to come into physical contact with his target. He can hold up to four Quirks, though each Quirk can only be used for ten minutes maximum. When the timer runs out, Monoma must touch the original user for another round of use. This is the reason why Aizawa remained in contact with Monoma as the latter constantly kept Erasure activated.


Similar to the other Quirks in My Hero Academia, the Copy Quirk is not all-powerful. Monoma can only use one Copied Quirk at a time. He also cannot copy Quirks that require stored resources like Fat Gum's Fat Absorption or Eri's Rewind. Furthermore, his Quirk is limited by his body. If his body cannot sustain the copied Quirk's drawbacks, then he can sustain damage or even perish from its usage.

The Switch has an extensive library of games covering all sorts of franchises and while it's got plenty of Final Fantasy titles nowadays, one game still missing in this particular series is Square Enix's massive (and highly successful) multiplayer role-playing game Final Fantasy XIV Online. So will we ever see it on a Nintendo system?
Game director and producer Naoki Yoshida (also known as Yoshi-P) was recently asked by Easy Allies about the possibility of a Nintendo release and mentioned how he wants to see the game available on as many devices as possible in the long run. This apparently includes Nintendo's hardware, and at the rate it's going, the new target could potentially be the Switch's "successor".

It's not just another sequel or spin-off, either - it's a "new mainline" game described as the next big "bold new adventure".
The team behind Shovel Knight says it's "committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics". What's even more exciting about this is it will apparently launch Shovel Knight into an "entirely new dimension of gaming"...could we finally see a 3D release or maybe some other generational leap?

With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Our Adventurer Guild is cheerfully simple in appearance, and its turn-based fights and griddy missions establish its parts at once as familiar, potentially even by-the-numbers. But those parts are arranged into an original and deceptively detailed mercenary management game that got harder to put down the longer I played.

In amongst the press releases, indie nuggets, and the occasional pitch for sponsored AI content (no, never), something truly exquisite occasionally peeks through the chest lid. This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct," the Dual Rulers announcement reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi "Suda51" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has "auto rock on," an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

Japanese developer M2, known for its work on Castlevania Advance Collection, Legend of Mana, and the superb Dodonpachi DaiOuJou Blissful Death Re:Incarnation, has stated that it wants to bring more of its games to the Nintendo Switch.
Speaking to Touch Arcade, M2's CEO and founder Naoki Horii confirmed that the studio is "always looking for that opportunity" to release more games on the Switch. He also later clarified, however, that "there are so many things I want to do compared to what I can actually do", which likely means that Switch owners may have to make do without a few titles, despite M2's best efforts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's on like (101 stages of) Donkey Kong.
14th June 2024 marks the 30th anniversary of Donkey Kong for the Game Boy's Japanese release. It's one of the finest games on the system and a hybrid arcade port/spin-off that ushered in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series which recently came to Switch.
In honour of the occasion, we thought we'd highlight this 2020 video examining the game made by erstwhile NL YouTube chap and all-'round good bloke Jon Cartwright. Here's hoping Nintendo adds this to the Switch Online GB lineup soon. Enjoy!

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet on the upcoming launch of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition. However, the discovery of the game's trophies via Exophase (thanks, VGC) may indicate that its release is just around the corner.
It would make sense too, right? With Nintendo confirming a Direct showcase to be aired at some point this month, Beyond Good & Evil feels like the perfect game to crop up during the presentation. Ubisoft also confirmed that it would be released in 'early 2024', but since we're arguably well beyond that point now, we feel it could drop on the Switch eShop at any point.

The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

Monster Hunter Stories soars onto the Nintendo Switch this week, so if you missed it during the 3DS' prime, now is your chance to give it a go.
Here on Nintendo Life, we said the game remained a charming and enjoyable experience (even if there was some surprising performance hiccups) and gave it 7 out of 10 stars:

We first heard Lollipop Chainsaw would be getting a remake back in 2022, and now the first official trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP has dropped, confirming it will arrive for Switch and multiple other platforms on 25th September 2024.
This updated version of the Grasshopper Manufacture title, by developer Dragami Games, is described as the "definitive version" of the game, leaving the story "unchanged" and instead focusing on quality-of-life improvements and additional gameplay content. The scene is set in the first trailer, which features the "legendary zombie hunter" Juliet.

One game we've now been waiting an entire generation for is Metroid Prime 4. Nintendo originally confirmed the game was coming in 2017 when E3 was still up and running, and this week technically marks the seventh anniversary of this announcement.
Since then, it's also been five years since Metroid Prime 4 was rebooted (in case you were wondering), with Retro Studios taking over the project under the watchful eye of producer Kensuke Tanabe.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…]]></summary>

When I first played Astro's Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game's short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

When playing as Axel, the in-game collectable bananas will also change to coins to better reflect the Crazy Taxi branding.

Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure really sets itself apart from other puzzle games. We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.
It’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.

Growing up, I didn't spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/13/playstation-rolling-out-update-to-allow-players-to-join-discord-chat-directly-from"/>
        <updated>2024-06-13T12:47:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the U.S. government, subscription IPTV services Jetflicks and iStreamitAll were once two of the largest piracy platforms in the country. Several defendants are now on trial in Las Vegas in a case that generated 19TB of data and 175,000 pages of print discovery, and has taken five years to prepare.

Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole.

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.” 
That sentiment was shared by Graham Parkes, who wrote Before Your Eyes and now serves as creative director and writer at Nice Dream. He a…]]></summary>

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer"/>
        <updated>2024-06-12T12:26:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 (the new one, not the bizarrely titled 25th-anniversary entry of the same name from 2013) has found its cover athlete. Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.
The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon." 
Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 here. For the first time in years, Madden won't be EA's only licensed football sim this year, as EA Sports College Football makes its comeback on July 19. You can watch the first trailer here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil continues to gradually infect Apple platforms with the reveal that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the remake of Resident Evil 2 are coming to iOS. The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.


It opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…]]></summary>

Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below:

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Covered last week on Phoronix was a new patch from Intel that with tuning to the P-State CPU frequency scaling driver was showing big wins for Intel Core Ultra "Meteor Lake" performance and power efficiency. I was curious with the Intel claims posted for a couple benchmarks and thus over the weekend set out to run many Intel Meteor Lake benchmarks on this one-line kernel patch... The results are great for boosting the Linux performance of Intel Core ultra laptops with as much as 72% better performance.]]></summary>

Metal Slug made its name as a fast-paced, run-and-gun explosive arcade shooter, making it all the more surprising how well it seemingly fits into a slower, turn-based strategy format. Since Metal Slug Tactics’ reveal at the final E3 in 2021, both series fans and tactics aficionados have been waiting with bated breath to get their hands on it. I count myself among them and was anxious to play a preview build to finally see how well this marriage of genres blends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you like your coffee? For those who answer: "served by a barista with ten arms wearing a mask adorned with intense scarlet lipstick", you are in luck. The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

It is a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage that has you chaining together thrown knives and solar plexus punches, headshots and tree-fu. Lob an empty pistol at your screen, and then replace it, because you’ll need it to watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Whether that means helping citizens with their problems or causing absolute chaos, the game gives players the freedom to twist and bend its colorful, destructible world to their whims. Sporting a variety of playable characters with unique talents, such as a ninja, chef, or hacker, you can cruise around in cars, boats, and other vehicles.

Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith.

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year.

We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Indy’s upcoming FPS adventure game, has a new ‘Official Showcase Reveal’ trailer, officially showcasing and revealing basically nothing about the game except that it features some pretty and decently acted cutscenes, which we already knew from the previous reveal. It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series. This subseries, which debuted in 2010, focuses on historical time periods and conspiracies surrounding them, creating narratives ripe with intri…]]></summary>

And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game's main character, though it's ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it's neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle.

As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are Tamagotchis a thing now again? I’m getting a sense they might be, but I’ll always associate them with the nineties. Ah, to return to a simpler time, where kids tripped each other up in the school hallways to steal toys , before Pokémon cards came along and everyone leveled up to stabbings. Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Summer Game Fest trailer for "narrative-centric cosy game" Wanderstop said it was from the creator behind The Stanley Parable, I thought I had surely entered a different dimension where The Stanley Parable was actually a wholesome shop-keeping sim rather than a zig-zagging office-based nightmare. Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.
