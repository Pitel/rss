Mario & Luigi: Brothership kicked off the latest Direct broadcast and although we've already seen a fair bit of footage of the game, one thing Nintendo hasn't properly shown off just yet is the game's box art. Yes, it's been featured in listings here and there, but now in the latest update it's been given an official reveal via social media.
As you see it shows the famous duo, a new character called Snoutlet and a little bit of the world Mario and Luigi are about to explore, known as Concordia. An empty background similar to Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey also returns. As noted by Nintendo, pre-orders for this game have also gone live.

Since Steam is a digital PC gaming marketplace, it relies on an online connection for all sorts of things, including allowing you to download the games you purchase, keep those games up to date, and track every game you're excited about that's yet to be released. However, the Steam wishlist not working error can ruin your ability to track games and make it so that you miss brand new releases if you don't know that a game has just come out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the new Pals added to Palworld with the Sakurajima update is an Electric and Dark dual-type variant of Helzephyr. This Pal can be pretty hard to track down, as it only spawns in a very specific and new area. Don't worry, I've done the hunting so you can reap the reward. 


Once you’ve traveled west and found the island of Sakurajima, you’ll want to head to the northern desert area of the island. This is the only place in Palpagos where you can find Helzephyr Lux.

If you’re hoping to capture one, you’re going to have a bit of a fight on your hands. Helzephyr Lux are pretty powerful, and they really don’t like staying inside your Pal Sphere. I’d recommend taking some strong Ground type Pals to fight alongside you, and the best option for this by far is Anubis. 


As well as this, you’ll want to have a good supply of high level Pal Spheres to throw at your weakened Helzephyr Lux. You’ll want Ultra Spheres, at the very least, but I’d recommend crafting and using some of the new Ultimate Spheres just to be safe. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Once you’ve captured a Helzephyr Lux, you’ll be able to use it as a flying mount by crafting the Helzephyr Lux Saddle, which unlocks via the Technology Ladder at level 52 costing 3 Technology Points. To make it, you’ll need the following resources:



30 Leather


10 Plasteel


30 Electric Organs


60 Paldium Fragments



Once you’re mounted on your Helzephyr Lux, you’ll be able to make use of this Partner Skill “Wings of Thunder”. This adds Electric damage to all of the attacks you use while mounted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While most Shinies aren't always guaranteed, there's at least one proven method to get the exclusive Shiny Celebi. This method is a bit tricky and comes with a time crunch. To better prepare you for this task, we're here to guide you on how to get a Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go.


Where to find Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go


You can get a Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go by participating in Masterwork or Special Research. These events are a surefire method of encountering the critter, with a guaranteed spawn as a reward.


For example, completing the Whispers in the Woods challenge results in a Shiny Celebi. However, this is where the time restriction comes in, where it only lasts from June 28 to July 3, 2024. You'll also need to purchase a ticket for the Masterwork Research for $5. Fortunately, once you've opened this research before the deadline, you can take your time completing the task since there is no time limit.  


Image by Destructoid


After you purchase a ticket in the in-game Shop, it can be found in your Item bag via the Passes section. Use it while the event is active to trigger a new lineup of tasks. Complete these objectives gradually to unlock the Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go. The quests shouldn't be too challenging to achieve, typically requiring you to catch a certain number of Pokémon or defeat Team Go Rocket members.


Other than Masterwork, some Special Research can involve a Shiny Celebi. We've seen this in the past with the Distracted by Something Shiny event. This option is free to play, but it all depends on when Niantic hosts another one again.


Keep in mind that a Shiny Celebi cannot be caught in the wild. So, you'll need to rely on these special events to get them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than 24 hours until Dawntrail releases for early access on June 28, Final Fantasy XIV released the full patch notes for the first patch of the expansion, Version 7.0. If you’ve read the preliminary patch notes, not much is different, but let's highlight the biggest changes.

In response to the blood saved, development team members are donating theirs to the NHS.


In an announcement on Twitter, the Gori Cuddly Carnage's publisher explained how the gallons of blood you see in all other versions of the title have been replaced in the Japanese version with "purple toy juice." The publisher insists that this is an entirely new substance and isn't just a recoloring or reskinning of the existing blood and gore players witnessed before the changes were made.

        <updated>2024-06-27T20:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mythic character, Max, is an absolute speed demon on the battlefield, thanks to her unique stats. Her abilities also make her a force to be reckoned with, and with the right gear, she can outlast almost any opponent. Here's how to get the best Max build in Brawl Stars, maximizing her powers and your strategic advantage.


What is the best build for Max in Brawl Stars?


To get the best performance for Max in Brawl Stars, use these attributes on her build:



Gadget: Phase Shifter


Gear: Damage


Star Power: Super Charged


Gear 2: Gadget Charge



The first Gadget you should choose is the Phase Shifter. It allows Max to dash forward and not take any damage while it's active, giving you the adaptability to maneuver the battlefield. Like any fighting game, immunity buffs are always a good choice, especially when you're facing a barrage of enemy attacks.


Since Max's Phase Shifter is incredibly useful, opting for her Gadget Charge Gear is a good idea. In return, you can activate it once more to increase your immunity temporarily. The other Gear option could go many ways, depending on your playstyle. Nevertheless, if you are still deciding which one to pick, it doesn't hurt to add the Damage buff for 15 percent Extra Damage when Max is at 50 percent health.


Screenshot by Destructoid


As for Max's Star Power, choose Super Charged to replenish her Super, Let's Go, much faster. This ability takes her speed to new heights with an additional boost in movement. Not only does it increase her speed, but it also works for any nearby allies. The Super Charged works well for Max's support role; however, you can choose Run N Gun instead if you prefer faster reloads. 


These gear options will make it almost impossible to catch Max. Her speed is your best friend here, and you can use it to evade as many enemy attacks as possible. If you want to improve other characters, check out our best Melodie build guide for more tips and tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selyne is one of the new Pals added to Palworld as part of the Sakurajima update. It’s the star of the new Moonflower Tower, where it fights alongside Saya. There is a way to capture Selyne outside of the tower, but the bad news is that you can’t control it. 


One of the new features added to Palworld in the Sakurajima update is Meteorites. These chunks of space rock fall from the sky and land close-by, allowing you to go and mine large numbers of Meteorite Fragments. That’s not all you can get, though. 


Where to find Selyne in Pa


Whenever a Meteor falls from the sky, it brings a rare Pal with it. The Pal the Metori falls with depends on where you were when the Meteorite fell. In order to capture Selyne, you’ll need to get lucky and be on Sakurajima Island when a Meteorite falls, because this is the only place Selyne will appear outside of Moonflower Tower. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Some other Pals which can appear during Meteorite events include Xenovander, which can appear in any location, and Xenogarde, which only appears if a Meteorite falls in the Dessicated Desert.


Selyne is a Dark and Neutral dual-type Pal, and can be ridden as a mount after making the corresponding saddle. It’s a surprisingly good base Pal, boasting level 3 work suitability in Handiwork, Medicine Production, and Transporting. When killed or captured, Selyne can drop Cloth, Sapphires, and Precious Claws. 


Selyne’s Partner Skill, Celestial Darkness, will enhance Fire and Dark type damage while being used as a mount. With all of these benefits, Selyne is definitely worth capturing if you can manage it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mysterious Mushrooms are a new resource added to Palworld as part of the Sakurajima update, and if you want to use a certain Pal as a mount, you’ll need to gather them. However, it’s not immediately clear where they come from.


You’ll need 20 Mysterious Mushrooms if you want to craft a Shroomer Noct Saddle, allowing you to mount up on Shroomer Noct and ride the derpy, majestic mushroom-hat Pal into battle. 


How to get Mysterious Mushrooms in Palworld


Unfortunately, the old adage “you can’t make an omelette without cracking eggs” rings true with this resource, because the only way to gather Mysterious Mushrooms in Palworld is by killing (or capturing, if you’re feeling benevolent) some Shroomer Noct. 


Thankfully, this nocturnal cousin of Shroomer is pretty easy to find. Once you’ve found Shroomer in its natural Mushroom Wetlands habitat, you’ll just have to wait until night-time for its purple tinted kin to emerge. 


If you’re lucky, you might also find Mysterious Mushrooms in Junk Piles occasionally. If you’re hoping to gather your Mushrooms this way, you’ll need to head to higher level areas such as the Astral Mountains or the new island of Sakurajima, as these Junk Piles offer higher level items as rewards.

Mysterious Mushrooms are used to craft the Shroomer Noct Saddle. This piece of Pal Gear can be unlocked upon reaching level 47 and costs 2 Technology Points. 


After obtaining the following resources, the Shroomer Noct Saddle can be crafted at a Pal Gear Workbench:



20 Leather


20 Mysterious Mushrooms


30 Fiber


10 Refined Ingots


30 Paldium Fragments

        <updated>2024-06-27T19:41:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re itching for a challenging fight in Palworld, the Sakurajima update has provided plenty of higher level Pals to test your mettle. One of these Pals, Knocklem, can only be found in one very specific location. 


Knocklem can be found on the new island of Sakurajima as an overworld Alpha Pal. After the update, it’s now the highest level Alpha Pal you can possibly fight and it truly gives far better than it gets. Hard hitting and absolutely massive, taking on Knocklem is not for the faint of heart. 


Where to find Knocklem in Palworld


To find Knocklem, you’ll need to head to the southern part of Sakurajima. The easiest way to do this is by heading to the Forgotten Island fast travel point and heading northwest. Once you’re there, make sure to unlock any fast travel points you encounter on the island itself. 


Fly west along the desert region in the south of Sakurajima island, carefully because there are some vicious Menastings and Toco Toco here who will gladly take you out, and you’ll come across a cavern in the cliff. You’ll need to fly into this cavern if you want to take on Knocklem.


Screenshot by Destructoid


At the end of this cavern, you’ll find Knocklem after a sheer drop, down in the water. Be careful if you're not ready to fight it just yet, Knocklem will start to attack even if you're just flying over, so keep your distance if you're curious. 


Like I said, Knocklem is massive and hits very hard. I’d recommend taking your strongest Pals with you as well as hard hitting weapons, such as a Laser Rifle or Missile Launcher. If you want to capture Knocklem, I’d suggest stocking up on Ultimate Spheres in order to maximize  your chances of a successful capture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4's Lovestruck expansion pack arrives on July 25, 2024. With it comes a complete revamp to the game's romance system, alongside three digital content bonuses if you pre-order the game between June 27 and September 5. Let's check out every pre-order bonus for the Lovestruck expansion.


All The Sims 4: Lovestruck expansion pack pre-order bonuses


From June 27 until September 5, pre-ordering The Sims 4's Lovestruck expansion pack will reward you with the following digital content bonuses:



Cry Me a River Eyeliner


Herbert Heart Plushy


Basic Breakup Double Bed



These three items are available as part of the Heartbreak Happens digital content pack, which you'll obtain in addition to the expansion pack. Once Lovestruck releases on July 25, you'll receive these pre-order bonus items in-game through the Create-a-Sim and build menu. While the build menu items will still cost you some Simoleons, the eyeliner is available as a customization option in the character creator.

The Heartbreak Happens digital content features an eyeliner makeup feature you can use while your character expresses sadness over a recent breakup, their favorite show ending, or anything else that upsets them. Herbert is an adorable plushie you can use on your home lot, while the double bed is a themed bed that fits up to two Sims. Judging by the name, though, it might be better suited for one Sim who's getting over a breakup and needs the extra space. 


If you don't purchase the Lovestruck expansion pack before it releases, don't worry; you'll have until September 5, giving you over a month of extra time to get the pack if you're interested in these bonus items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the Pals in the entirety of Palworld, Chillet has become a fan favorite since the game released. Now, with the release of the Sakurajima update, Chillet has a new and much more pink variant — Chillet Ignis. 


Chillet Ignis is a Fire and Dragon dual-type Pal who is equal parts hard-hitting and adorable. To find them, you’re going to have to travel to the new island of Sakurajima, where it spawns in select locations around the Cherry Blossom forests.

When you approach Chillet Ignis, rather than standing and fighting, the Pal will turn on its heel and run away. It’s surprisingly shy, but it’s worth chasing after one if you want a strong Pal. They’re pretty easy to defeat, especially if you wake a strong Water type Pal with you. 


Once captured, a Chillet Ignis can be used as a mount. To do this, you’ll need to unlock the Chillet Ignis Saddle at level 45, costing 2 Technology Points. After that, you’ll need the following resources to craft the saddle:



20 Leather


30 Fiber


10 Cloth


10 Flame Organs


30 Paldium Fragments



Chillet Ignis’ Partner Skill is called “Crackling Weasel”, and adds Fire type damage to all attacks when mounted. On your base, Chillet Ignis will be able to help out with both Kindling and Gathering, although its stats aren’t impressive. It has a Kindling level 3 and Gathering level 1. 


When killed or captured, Chillet Ignis will drop both Leather and Flame Organs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rotten Fruit is a challenge in Hitman World of Assassination that tasks you with poisoning one of the location's targets, Sinhi "Akka" Venthan, using a Durian. Not only is this item hard to come by, and chances to poison the target are even rarer, but there is a simple method for those willing to put in the work. 


The Rotten Fruit challenge was added to Hitman WoA with the summer 2024 update alongside The Disruptor Elusive Target. You can find it in the Feats menu in the Ambrose Island location. You don't need any special equipment to complete the challenge, but you will get the Durian item if you complete it and go on to exit the mission. The item is actually incredibly useful, and I've been eager to get my hands on it for other locations ever since Ambrose Island was released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all of the new Pals added to Palworld in the Sakurajima update, one has already become more beloved than any of the others — Croajiro. This frog-with-a-stick Pal is cute but deadly, and has an unexpectedly dark Paldeck entry. 


If you’re diving into Palworld with the hope of immediately sprinting out and capturing a Croajiro, you’re in luck. The frog Pal is pretty widespread, although mostly showing up in the lower level forest biome and on Sakurajima itself. 


Where to find Croajiro in Palworld, the Sakurajima update

The easiest place to catch Croajiro is in the area immediately surrounding the starting area in Palworld. The Croajiro here are relatively low level, and therefore easily caught using most types of Pal Spheres. Even fights with high level Croajiros are pretty easy to get through though, especially if you go armed with either hard-hitting weapons or a strong Electric type Pal. 


Croajiro isn’t a very strong addition to your Base, with level one Handiwork, Transporting, Watering, and Gathering skills. When killed or captured, it drops Pal Fluids and Cloth. A recently caught Croajiro will have only Aqua Gun available to it as an attack.


However, two things make this Pal one to catch - the Paldeck entry, which is as amusing as it is dark, and the rather interesting Partner Skill. 


When Croajiro is accompanying you as you explore, using his Partner Skill will enable you to climb on top of him and be flung high into the air. This is particularly useful when trying to reach high areas, or if you want to use your Parachute to travel across a long distance. 


Meanwhile, Croajiro’s Paldeck entry is as follows:

Whether you’re looking for a boost in Gold, or wanting to mount up and run for longer, these new traits offer benefits across the board. If you capture Pals with these traits, it’s definitely worth hanging on to them.


Palworld Passive Skills added in Sakurajima


While none of these Passive Skills are likely to change the way you play, I’m certain that there will be a whole new surge in Pal Breeding in order to get them in your party. Without further ado, here’s all the new Passive Skills being added to Palworld with the Sakurajima update:

Crude Oil is used in a lot of high level recipes, from Flamethrower Fuel to Plasteel, which is needed if you want to upgrade your armor to the latest and most protective set. You’re going to need a lot of Crude Oil, but how do you get it?


Most ways of getting Crude Oil are not guaranteed. It does drop from certain Pals, for instance I’ve obtained Crude Oil from both Maraith and Kikit during dungeon encounters, as well as in the wilds of Palpagos. You can also find Crude Oil during Supply Drops, or in chests around the Oil Rig Stronghold.

Considering the lengthy ongoing development of Beyond Good & Evil 2 and the subsequent grilling from eager fans that Ubisoft has brought upon itself over the years, it’s easy to forget just how darn good the original game is. First released on PS2, Xbox, and GameCube at the end of 2003, Beyond Good & Evil was one of the most unique adventure games of its day, showcasing a world that Nintendo itself would have been proud to call its own.
This 20th Anniversary Edition remaster updates the experience with revamped visuals, improved performance (sort of), quality-of-life upgrades, and more. But is it still as enjoyable now as it was two decades ago? Well, the answer is thankfully a resounding “yes”: Ubisoft’s re-release is easily the best way to experience Jade and Pey’j’s epic journey on Nintendo hardware, but it’s also not without a few niggling issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed in a new Developer video for World of Warcraft Season of Discovery that the final phase for SoD, Phase 4, will begin on July 11, 2024. With this final phase, players will be able to reach the final level cap of 60 as well as enter the final two raids, Onyxia's Lair and Molten Core.




WoW Season of Discovery kicked off back on November 30, 2023, with each subsequent phase hitting about 3 months later. This has brought us to now, with WoW SoD going into its fourth and final phase. The final Phase will stagger content releases for a couple weeks once Phase 4 begins.


On July 11, Season of Discovery officially enters Phase 4, raising the Level cap to 60 and unlocking all the remaining quests and zones.


A week later on July 18, two World Bosses will become available through new Instance Portals. The two World Bosses are Azuregos the blue dragon of Azshara, and Lord Kazzak, the Doomlord from the Blasted Lands.


Finally, a week after that on July 25, the two final raids of World of Warcraft Season of Discovery will go live. First, is Molten Core, a 20-player raid with 10 classic bosses featuring revamped loot, redesigned Tier 1 gear sets, and 'more'. Blizzard has been mum on the more part, but I have a feeling something cool Sulfuras-related awaits.


Also releasing on July 25 is the Onyxia's Lair raid which features the infamous black dragon and her many many whelps. Handle it!


Blizzard hasn't revealed what's next in store for World of Warcraft Classic once the Phase 4 of Season of Discovery ends, but World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic has been live for just over a month now.


Season of Discovery Season 4 begins on July 11, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All the Tarnished out there are getting punished on a minute-by-minute basis and loving it. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree launched on June 21, 2024, and the official accounts are already reporting five million copies sold around the world.


According to Bandai Namco Entertainment's original press release, these numbers come after just three days of the DLC's release. The X (formerly Twitter) account for Elden Ring thanked "the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella."




A new accolades trailer also dropped along with the news:




Much has been said about the difficulty of Shadow of the Erdtree in the days since its arrival. At first it was too brutal even for seasoned vets of Elden Ring and other FromSoftware titles. Then its unique leveling system got patched and players were split on the adjustments. Regardless of where folks fall on the usual "too hard/not hard enough" scale, it's clear plenty were eagerly anticipating the long-awaited expansion.


Now, how many of those five million (and counting, presumably) Tarnished were able to access the DLC as soon as it launched? Show us the hard numbers, Bandai Namco! I'd love to know how many had progressed far enough through optional areas and encounters to enter the Realm of Shadow. 


Hopefully everyone will get there eventually, because Shadow of the Erdtree is a hell of a send-off for Elden Ring as a whole.

Now in its third edition, M&M is a d20-based game with a wealth of settings for any superhero style, including licensed adaptations of DC Comics and Wild Cards, the shared universe edited by George R.

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

Is there any genre SteamWorld is afraid to tackle? Starting life as an RTS in SteamWorld Tower Defense, Image & Form’s long-running anthology series has been to space, the Wild West and it’s even taken on the form of a fairy tale. And while Dig, the Metroidvania-style series, is arguably the most popular, many have a soft spot for the 2015 3DS hit SteamWorld Heist.
Returning to the strategy-esque roots of the franchise, SteamWorld Heist is a side-on turn-based strategy game that takes the unique aesthetic and humour of the SteamWorld series and combines it with gunslinging, bullet-ricocheting action. We loved it, and Ultimate Edition on Switch is a no-brainer. Even so, we weren’t expecting to see Heist return, but nine years later, SteamWorld Heist II is almost here. We got a chance to go hands-on with the PC version of the game at Summer Game Fest, and we can already tell this is a well-oiled machine that fans will love, and newcomers can jump straight into, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Albatroz is a "backpacking adventure RPG" that takes place in The Forbidden Lands, a photogenic wilderness "where two worlds converge". You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

An injunction targeting the defendant aims to ensure there's no repeat of any similar behavior, anywhere in the world, ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

If you had visited an arcade in the late '70s and ’80s, there’s a good chance you’d come across a bustling Sprint cabinet complete with crowd-pulling steering wheels and pedals. Atari’s once ubiquitous overhead racing classic is now making a comeback on modern consoles with NeoSprint, and we’re happy to report that it largely holds up as a well-executed throwback.
It’s the latest in Atari’s effort to partner with indie developers to bring its classic IPs into the 21st century. Headless Chicken, the Costa Rican studio behind this loving retro revival, manages to retain the rubber-burning essence of the original games while incorporating contemporary gameplay modes, vehicle customization, and a surprisingly robust track builder.

It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

If you've never stumbled across one before, KidZania is a strange concept. This is a child-sized indoor city full of ultrarealistic role-playing opportunities for kids to try out different careers, make money (only to be used in the attraction, we might add) and get a taste of adult life.
The available career experiences vary across the 26 KidZania sites worldwide, though they always tend to offer a broad spectrum covering everything from a doctor to a TV presenter. What we didn't realise, however, is that two of Japan's KidZania sites (Tokyo and Koshien) have teamed up with Nintendo to offer a 'Game Developer' experience for its young attendees.

That's because said area is a woodland that's been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don't dare clop their hooves. What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

In a post ominously titled "Tribes 3 Player Update", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" Ultra Strikers. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

This comes alongside repeated employee training on correct information-handling practices.

It's fair to say that the late Queen Elizabeth II had her fair share of bling during her 70-year reign; you know, the Imperial State Crown, the Sovereign's Orb, the Kokoshnik Tiara... rather expensive stuff, a few notches above the kind of tat you might have found at the bottom of a box of Coco Pops.
Given her status, however, we imagine many folks also attempted to send her a number of luxurious gifts. One such example came courtesy of publisher THQ to celebrate the Wii release of the long-forgotten Big Family Games (Neighborhood Games). Rather than send just the game itself, THQ commissioned a 24K gold-plated Wii console to be carted off to Buckingham Palace.

Last year, when Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was released, there were concerns raised about the game's $70 USD price tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

        <updated>2024-06-26T18:02:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

Announced as part of the Frontier Unlocked livestream, F1 Manager 2024 will launch on Switch on 23rd July, marking the first time the motorsport management sim series has made the starting grid on Nintendo's system.
Rather than driving the cars, the F1 Manager series puts you in the shoes of a team manager responsible for every other aspect of the race outside the actual piloting. You can choose from one of the 10 real-life teams or, alternatively, create your own constructor in a new feature for the 2024 edition which lets you craft all sorts of details, including (most importantly) the colours of the cars. Stripes make it go faster, you know.

Now, it might not be the most accurate way to navigate the sky-high courses, but Dr Tom Tilley's creative build — which uses the same trackball principle as the Super Monkey Ball Ticket Blitz arcade game — certainly looks the part.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has beaten the likes of Astro Bot and Doom: The Dark Ages to be the most wishlisted game of the Summer Showcase Season. That's according to data from IGN Playlists, via GameIndustry.biz.
Prior to last week's cracking Nintendo Direct, PlayStation 5 exclusive platformer Astro Bot was at the top, but Zelda has swept in at the last moment to take the number one spot. The new title was a big surprise during the Direct, and the chance to play as Zelda for the first time (properly, the CDi doesn't count!) along with the creative new gameplay elements have got IGN readers pretty hyped up. Yes, we are IGN readers too, and no, we're not owned by them — we're still independent here at Nintendo Life.

Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor.

Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore.

A police investigation suggests that cost savings likely played a role too, which is not surprising given local file-sharing habits.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I've only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.

Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels' music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they're already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were 'evasive' on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it's just two guys in a lion suit. They aren't even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.

I was tempted to recreate a hellish mockery of his fun hidden face game by trapping a crumbling mirror image of his visage, Dorian Gray style, somewhere in the above image. Alas, my version of Photoshop appears to be lacking that function. I suppose I will have to turn to other avenues of entertainment, such as a video game, should any exist.
So I just checked there's actually loads of them. What a turn out! Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend.

Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber, generated millions of dollars in revenue through Jetflicks, a subscription service that reportedly offered more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed.

As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what's coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an "Innapropriate activity detected" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by "Project Phoenix", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a "visual prototype" for a brand new Red Faction game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realised recently that a juicy subject for another Should You Bother With has been staring me in the face – or rather, I’ve been staring at it. Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the 'default' option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn't treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won't guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They're more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat's hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it's a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you'll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.
Here's our list of the 19 best roguelikes on PC you can play in 2024.

With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.
That Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. 
"This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life By You's Early Access release," Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. "Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…]]></summary>

It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.
Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The Republic Of Pirates was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up strategy, out today with a demo on Steam at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.

What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character.

As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales Of The Shire unfolds in a world without shadow. There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. "Gobshite" became "bastard". The "polis" were localised as the "police". And every "yersel" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became "yourself". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to "International English" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There's another option, says one of the game's developers.

And it's by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there's one thing that really gets me going, it's a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form.

It's a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. "Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too," notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. "So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.]]></summary>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.

While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.]]></summary>

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…]]></summary>

The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
