        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it feels like it has been more or less known already, NetEase formally confirmed the arrival of The Thing and Human Torch for Marvel Rivals. Alongside the new characters, the team also showed off a beautiful new map where players can duke it out to end Dracula's Eternal Night.


After nixing a controversial mid-season rank reset, Marvel Rivals is poised to earn even more goodwill with another two new characters and a map that seemingly concludes the ongoing narrative. Of course, all of these changes come alongside a slew of balance changes that help bring some characters back in line while buffing other underperformers. You won't have to wait too long, as the latest batch of content is due out on Friday, February 21.

He endured a lot during his short and tumultuous 40-year life and used his experiences to create dark tales and lyrical poetry that secured his place in literary history. 


Boston-born Poe has a host of “firsts” to his name, among which is the remarkable claim that he was the first well-known American author to have made his entire living solely from writing. He made early contributions to both the science fiction and detective fiction genres but is most well known for his macabre short stories and poems. 


Poe has quite an extensive bibliography. Most of his short stories and poems were published in periodicals and journals during his lifetime. If you’re new to the world of Poe, or …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards Of The Coast's official Twitter account just revealed Summons will work as Enchantment Creature Sagas on the upcoming MTG x Final Fantasy crossover set.


One of the biggest questions regarding the upcoming set was the workings of summons, which could've appeared as various things, such as creatures or sorcery spells, but it turns out they're another thing entirely.




They’re Enchantment Creature Sagas, a specific type of pre-existing MTG enchantment that’s not permanent but holds immense power. Saga cards tend to feature three effects that will trigger effects in each of the three turns after their summoning and then vanish.


The Final Fantasy X version of Shiva, the one that'll feature on this collab, will tap an enemy creature of your choice for the first two turns, then unleash Diamond Dust, her famous Overdrive that will have her owner draw a card for each tapped creature their opponents control. Being an Enchantment Creature Saga means that on top of her saga abilities, Shiva also behaves as a regular creature for three turns before automatically going to the graveyard.


So, instead of working like Sorceries or Instant Magics, akin to how they behave in most of the games in the Final Fantasy series, the Summons from the MTG Final Fantasy set will behave more similarly to the Summons from Final Fantasy X. They'll stay in the game for a while, and not just show up for an attack before vanishing.


Popular trading card game Magic: The Gathering has been experimenting with several fantasy-themed collaborations via its Universes Beyond endeavor over the past few years. We've previously seen Dungeons & Dragons and Lord Of The Rings-inspired crossovers, and while those were pretty cool, I doubt hardly anything could ever beat the upcoming Final Fantasy x MTG crossover in terms of gamer hype.


Magic The Gathering X Final Fantasy releases on June 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser and his team were laid off by NetEase Games on Feb. 18, he announced on LinkedIn. This move comes despite the game's successful launch in December 2024 and an estimated $130 million in first-month revenue, according to Chinese outlet Game Look.


"My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games," Sasser wrote. "And were just laid off!" It remains unclear how many employees were affected, the size of Sasser’s team, or how many developers are still working on Marvel Rivals. Destructoid has reached out to Sasser and NetEase Games for comment.

The Marvel Rivals layoffs come just two months after NetEase Games relocated staff from its mobile title Operation Apocalypse to other departments. Liquid Swords Studio, which is backed by NetEase, recently announced it is also reducing its workforce.


There are no indications that Marvel Rivals staff members outside the U.S. were affected by the layoffs. However, at least two level designers and the game director were let go, confirming that those impacted were directly involved in the game's development.


Marvel Rivals' success was already putting pressure on Overwatch


The timing of the layoffs contradicts the game’s strong momentum. Marvel Rivals has maintained 200,000+ concurrent players on PC, according to Steam Charts, and was already being acknowledged by Blizzard as a serious competitor to Overwatch, which had previously dominated the hero shooter genre.


"We're obviously in a new competitive landscape that I think, for Overwatch, we've never really been in before," Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller told GamesRadar. "There is pressure on the Overwatch team, and a lot of it is internal," he admitted, referring to how Marvel Rivals is making his team ask if they're making the "best possible game" they can make.

Week three continues the story in Heresy, but a hurdle presents itself as three MacGuffins from Wizards scattered around the Moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Aaand it's back. Hollow Knight: Silksong has returned to the US Nintendo eShop with a TBD release date.


I'm not a doomsayer, and I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation, but it appears as though the listing for Hollow Knight: Silksong on the US Nintendo eShop has been removed. Instead of displaying information about the upcoming game, there's simply an image of Wario along with the message "Whoops! The info you're looking for can't be found!"





Thankfully, it's only the US Nintendo eShop listing that has been removed. Hollow Knight: Silksong still has a listing on the EU eShop, as well as other platforms like Xbox Live, Steam, and the PlayStation Store. For further assurance, the Hollow Knight: SilkSong website still has the Nintendo Switch logo listed for platforms.


As I said, I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. Maybe something to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, right? Maybe becoming a launch title? Maybe someone just accidentally moved the listing to the wrong castle. Or, maybe the scope of Silksong has grown too much to where it's going to be rebranded as Hollow Knight 2? All speculation at this point and the actual importance of it disappearing from the eShop could be nothing or everything. Only time will tell.


I've personally forced myself to move Hollow Knight: Silksong to the back of my brain, at least until we get something new. There are a ton of great games coming out this year, I can't keep telling myself at every conference or event that surely this is when we're going to get an update on Silksong. I just can't keep doing it, it's not healthy.


Anyway, at this point, Hollow Knight: Silksong as we know it is expected to release some day on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nighthawk potion stands out as one of the most advantageous items in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, illuminating the path for players in the heart of darkness. But, despite its perks, it does come with a downside that practically hinders your vision in the heat of the day.


Many players have noted that when the Nighthawk potion is still activated in the daytime, it casts a blinding white-colored light that covers the entire screen. You can't see anything, making it almost impossible to move around. I tried it myself, and boy, is it bright. It looks as if Henry is staring straight into the sun, no matter where you go.

Even though it seems like common knowledge not to use Nighthawk during the day, this occurrence can actually happen more times than you think. Some…]]></summary>

While plenty of board games for couples are available on the market in 2025, not all of them are suitable. Many board games are playable with just two players, but most are best played with more. Others might be too simple or too complex for you and your partner. I have included ten board games for couples of all types in this list.

GAME staff have accused the UK retailer of "scalping" Pokémon cards after the company began hitching massive shipping costs to the online sale of 'Prismatic Evolutions' mini tins (thanks, Eurogamer).
These mini tins are no novelty for a TCG expansion. They contain two booster packs and a collectible coin and retail for £10.99, tidy. The problem is that GAME is adding a bulky £19.99 "Oversized delivery" fee on top of that, making the overall purchase a little less 'mini' than the name suggests.

First things first, New Weird is a niche or subgenre of modern science fiction that very much rhymes with the works of David Lynch. It is partially derived from old pulp fiction horror writing, which means it shares a whole lot with cosmic horror as well. Broadly, New Weird is "a type of urban, secondary-world fiction that subverts the romanticized ideas about place found in traditional fantasy, largely by choosing realistic, complex real-world models as the jumping-off point for creation of settings that may combine elements of b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to earn a free pack for your Ultimate Team inventory.


The cost of completing this challenge is pretty low, and you should have most of the fodder required in your club. Using them will reduce the completion costs and increase your rewards' valuation. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and whether doing so will be worthy of your resources.


EA FC 25 Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC tasks


The Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC has one task, and here are its requirements. 


Task - Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC



Min. 5 Players from the same Nation


Max. 5 Players from the same League


Min. Clubs in Squad: 5


Min. 5 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 80


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 25 Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC solutions


While the idea is to use cards you already have at your club, there's a chance for you to get stuck. If that's the case, the following solution will help you to quickly unlock all the rewards. 


Task - Grassroot Greats Challenge 3 SBC



Gnabry ST 82


Sellner ST 82


Freigang CAM 83


van Egmond CDM 82


Hipp CDM 72


Muller CAM 82


McNabb LB 79


Kolstermann CB 79


Chabot CB 77


Heyer RB 68


Asman GK 70



This is one of the best fodder challenges to complete, as you get a Rare Players Pack. This pack has 12 Rare Gold Player items, with one guaranteed to be rated 83 or higher. The chances for the pack to contain a walkout/promo item are pretty high. At worst, the fodder you get from it can be used to complete recent releases like Athenea Grassroot Greats SBC.

Ever since Nintendo gave us our first official look at the Switch 2 (even before, if you were paying attention to the leaks), we have been wondering what that mysterious new USB-C port on the top of the console is for.
Logic would suggest that it's for charging in tabletop mode — something that we haven't been able to do with any 'Switch 1' model so far — but last week's patent which showed the console working when flipped upside down had us (and the rest of the internet, it seems) wondering if the original, lower port might be the real star of the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over four years since RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition first launched, and now more platforms are finally on the horizon. Atari is bringing the sim to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on March 20, 2025.


The Complete Edition previously made its way to PC and Nintendo Switch in September 2020. Turning back the clock even further, the original Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. That certainly lands it firmly in the "nostalgic" camp for some at this point, and you can stoke those rose-tinted fires with the announcement trailer below.




As its title suggests, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition includes the third entry in full HD along with the content from the expansion packs. The Soaked! expansion is all about water parks and the Wild! expansion has you throwing animal habitats into the mix. The full package here seems right in line with previous versions, so don't go into the PlayStation and Xbox ports looking for anything new. 


The rest is more or less just how we all remember it. You'll be tasked with managing everything from staff to shops as you attempt to grow your theme park. Or, if you just feel like going wild, you can hit up sandbox mode and build the park of your dreams without worrying about a ballooning budget.


When Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition launches on PlayStation and Xbox next month, you can strap in for a one-time entry fee of $29.99. There's also a 20 percent discount in place for those who preorder.

They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.
Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.

Screenshot by Destructoid


How to Stealth Kill successfully


In order to perform a Stealth Kill in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you need to have a Dagger equipped. You can find them scattered throughout Bohemia, or you can craft one at the Blacksmith or purchase one from a merchant. Unlike most other weapons in KCD2, you can't actually engage in combat with a Dagger. Instead, it simply gives you the option to perform a Stealth Kill.


Once you have a Dagger equipped, you then want to enter your crouched/stealth mode by hitting 'C' key by default on PC. When hiding, you are harder to see by enemies and this allows you to sneak up on your target to perform a Stealth Kill.


Next, walk close behind your target, and when you get close enough, you will see the prompts in the bottom right corner of the screen to execute a Stealth Kill. By default on PC, you need to hold the 'F' key to carry out the Stealth Kill. Simply tapping the 'F' key instead of holding it will perform a Knock Out, which won't kill your target but rather disable them quietly for a short duration.


Sometimes when executing a Stealth Kill, your target will attempt to fight back. When this happens you will see indicators in the middle of your screen, similar to the counterattack and block indicators when engaged in Melee Combat. If you see the green Block indicator, you must right click, whereas if it's the blue counter-attack indicator, you must left-click. If you fail either of these checks the enemy will stop you from executing the Stealth Kill as well as alert others in the area to come and help them.

While it only looks like a car maintenance tool on its surface, it's more helpful than you'd initially expect. You can even turn it into a money-making method with time and dedication.


Where to get the Golden Wrench in BitLife


Getting the Golden Wrench requires buying it from BitLife's marketplace. There, you'll find every Golden item released alongside features like Bitizenship and expansion packs. The Golden Wrench's full price is $13.99 with it being on sale for $6.99 during its initial launch week.

Back in 2023, Morgan shared his account with another player, nicknamed Forbes, who'd go on to earn a pretty neat cash prize. Unfortunately for him, however, he was caught and disqualified, but that was still not enough to quench Epic Games' thirst for justice.


As spotted by Kotaku, Epic's retaliation for his attempt to qualify for the Fortnite Championship Series Grand Finals in 2023 ended with a lawsuit that forced Bamford to post a video admission of guilt on his own YouTube channel. Though the video is only 20 seconds long — perhaps the minimum length permitted by the lawsuit — it remains incredibly painful to watch.




Bamford wrote, “Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments, and I apologize to the Fortnite community for my actions,” which reads like something Epic PR had written for him.


Bamford concluded by saying he'd never cheat in Fortnite again, to which one user responded with, "No sh*t bruh you banned lmfao," with others voicing similar sentiments (and the same level of eloquence).


On top of the public humiliation, Bamford had to pay a monetary settlement, which included the prize money he'd won through his twisted alliance with Forbes. Epic will donate the money to the Child's Play charity. We don't know the exact amount Bamford had to pay for the settlement, but his Fortnite series placement had earned him $10,000.

When Sony launched the PS1 in 1994, Nintendo suffered one of its biggest losses when Squaresoft, a company that previously became almost synonymous with Nintendo consoles, chose to release its games on the PS1 instead of the N64.
In fact, according to a new interview from Sony veteran Shuhei Yoshida by VentureBeat (thanks, Go Nintendo), Squaresoft initially tried to convince Nintendo to adopt CD-ROMs for the N64 instead of cartridges, with Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi especially keen to utilise the technology.

If you’re achievement hunting in Bloom & Rage Tape 1, you’ll have seen “Here’s Mary!”, which requires you to get through a game of Bloody Mary. It’s an old urban legend that says if you repeat “Bloody Mary” in the mirror three times, then the ghost of Bloody Mary herself will be summoned. It’s all very 90s, and therefore the perfect fit for Bloom & Rage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like the real world, BitLife's jobs vary in complexity, requirements, and pay ranges. Some jobs pay hundreds of thousands of dollars but require nearly a decade of post-secondary schooling, while others are accessible as soon as your character turns 18. 


There are many reasons for picking up a specific job, from wanting to make a lot of money to completing particular weekly challenges. Becoming a baker in BitLife for achievements and challenges may seem difficult initially, but it's surprisingly easy once you know what to look for.


How to become a baker in BitLife


Unlike advanced jobs in BitLife that require special career packs or university degrees, the baker job only requires a clean criminal record. You don't even need to finish high school, but having a secondary school diploma will help if you pursue other jobs later. You'll find the baker role under Occupation and Jobs.


Screenshot by Destructoid


However, you're not guaranteed to see it immediately, especially if your character graduated from university. Completing a university program causes BitLife to filter through jobs related to your degree to make it easier to pursue particular career types. If your character starts right from high school, you'll have more varied job options, raising your odds of seeing a baker position open.


You'll know you've found a baker job when you scroll near the bottom of the list and see "Baker" with a croissant emoji next to its name. From here, you just need to apply for the position and pass the interview to officially land the job and knock out any related achievements, scavenger hunts, or challenge objectives. In particular, you can knock out the Master Baker candy heart of BitLife's 2025 Valentine's Day scavenger hunt or wait for future challenges that require this job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short of Civilliant.
Most games with numbered sequels tend to iterate and grow on their previous instalments. After all, you don’t want to alienate your audience by upending key systems and creating a substantially different experience from what they’re used to, it just makes sound economic sense. Change things just enough so that it rides that line between familiarity and shininess.
Firaxis apparently missed this particular industry-wide memo, and thus the Civilization series will happily buck its own trends and well-established ideas in order to deliver something fresh every single time, and that is no less the case with Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, which we’ll be calling ‘Civ 7’ for the sake of our keyboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii made me smile a lot, but I think the folks at RGG need to take a break for a few years. Watch some films. Have some cocktails. Get inspired again, y'know? Just as the high seas are the refuge of displaced Yakuza or insolvent scoundrels in this minigame-stuffed brawler-RPG, the game feels like the last port of call for a studio scraping the bottom of the grog barrel.
I smiled a lot, mind. It's hard not to with Majima back; moisturised, flourishing, driving a six-inch tanto knife into a man's kidneys for being mildly rude to him on the beach, and abducting monkeys for his petting zoo. He's also the captain of a pirate ship now, having woken on a strange island with no memory of his Yakuza past, but the same sense of fair play and manic flair for theatrical shankings. Plus, he's already got the eyepatch sorted.
Why are there actual, cannon-wielding, tricorn-headed pirates off the coast of Hawaii? Shhh. Just get on the boat. You do find the idea of a Majima being a pirate entertaining enough on its own to last you twenty five hours, don't you? I hope so, because this shorter side entry in the series isn't so much lean as it is thin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's not long to go before NBA 2K25's Season 5 goes live, as Visual Concepts has confirmed the date and time. Once again, players will have plenty of content to unlock by grinding out the new season. 


So far, we haven't had any hints about the seasonal rewards, but they will no doubt appear as grindable milestones. With the release date now official, the community only has a few days to maximize their ongoing Season 4 rewards.


NBA 2K25 Season 5 release date


The new season will be going live on Friday, February 21. Visual Concepts will follow the expected schedule, as all seasons thus far have been released on Friday evenings. Once the new season goes live, players can expect to grind through the Season Pass (there will be a paid upgrade available as well).


Season 5 goes live at 8 am PT/11 am ET on Friday. Make sure to complete all 40 levels of rewards available from the Season 4 Pass before the next season gets here.

NBA 2K25 Season 5 rewards


So far, 2K hasn't announced rewards, but we can expect a Season 5 Pass with free and paid versions. We'll also have unique items to unlock for both MyCareer and MyTeam modes.


While there are some significant changes in Season 5, the pass will stick to 40 levels of rewards to unlock. If you opt for the paid upgrade, you'll be able to get an extra 40 rewards, which should include promo cards, VC, and more.


The rewards will be updated once we have confirmation from 2K, and we're expecting an announcement a couple of days before the new season begins on Friday, February 21.

Now, to be perfectly clear, it's not like Nvidia PhysX was at all important for the modern gaming industry. Though it did reach reasonable adoption back in the early 2010s, it's been effectively defunct for the longest time. The most prolific games to adopt PhysX in its heyday were Borderlands 2 (as featured in the video below), Fallout 4, and Batman: Arkham Knight.

We're about six weeks away from Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct in April, and the company presumably preparing furiously for the full reveal of its upcoming hardware. Until then, we're left to analyse statements around its financial results and other little announcements for clues about the Switch successor beyond its form factor. The firm's latest announcement is tangentially related to Switch 2, and it comes as a big disappointment to many: Nintendo is scrapping its Gold Points scheme.
Originally launched in March 2016 as part of My Nintendo, a replacement for Club Nintendo, you won't earn Gold Points on any eShop purchases after 24th March 2025. This means that anyone buying Switch 1 games on the upcoming successor won't benefit from the loyalty system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really, really like Is This Seat Taken? It might just be that this logic puzzler sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.
You've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. "I want to sit with Bob". "I need a window seat". "I forgot to shower". "I do not like bad smells". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games are considering letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map by way of Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics, according to a report. The idea is that people can make and sell their own “custom experiences”, as they do in those games - expanding upon the existing customisation opportunities in GTA Online. This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in GTA 5.

Nintendo has announced that its Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers saving service will not extend to Switch 2 exclusives (thanks, VGC).
The vouchers initially cropped up in 2019 as a way to make a small saving on first-party Switch titles. Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can buy a voucher for £84/$100 and use it to redeem two Switch big hitters (Breath of the Wild, Paper Mario, Pokémon Scarlet & Violet etc.) that would normally come in at a higher combined price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a recent house clearout I discovered a cache of creative writing from my teenage years. Naturally, I now consider most of it to be unbearable. Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with "O Muse". BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 


Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform Amphora Hell, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. "No evidence of my failure must remain," he bellows in the Itch preamble. "Prepare to be scrapped!"

Leave me alone, for I am immersed in the stinky fantasy of being a sniveling Skaven bin-licker, commanding my slaves to mine useless gold purely because it irritates my dwarfish enemies.
As such, I'm not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too. A new blog post outlines the changes they're making to AI, and there's an experimental beta branch available right now if you want to test them out.

It often feels as if video games take the opposite approach, gleefully piling tropes high upon their back like Labyrinth's junk lady. Sure, they sacrifice the opportunity to say anything affecting or which feels true, but presumably the theory is that reminding you of a dozen other films, TV shows, books and games you like is just as good.

Enter Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, hunched over from the weight of all the teen TV shows and young adult novels stacked atop its shoulders.

Nintendo has announced that it is discontinuing the My Nintendo Gold Points program, stating that it will no longer be possible to earn points from 24th March 2025 (or 25th March depending on your region). Platinum points, however, will remain unchanged.
Gold points were rewarded through the purchase of both digital and physical Switch games, allowing you to apply them to future digital purchases for a reasonable discount. Even at just 5% of the purchase price (with the odd additional promotion here and there), it was frankly one of the best incentives on the system and a great way to save a bit of extra cash for those upcoming big first-party releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The good, the bad, and the ugly.
It seems like an absurd notion these days, but after Tomb Raider made its debut in 1996, developer Core Design pumped out six mainline entries over the next eight years – six. It’s true that teams were able to turn projects around much more quickly in those days, as evidenced by franchises such as Resident Evil and Final Fantasy, but it was also a clear indication of just how popular Lara Croft had become, and how much publisher Eidos Interactive wanted to milk the series to within an inch of its life.
The story goes that Core Design had grown weary of Tomb Raider by the time it commenced work on the fourth entry, The Last Revelation. Though keen to wean off Lara Croft and be done with the series, the team was ordered by Eidos to press on with even more Tomb Raider games. So while one group of devs reworked scrapped ideas from The Last Revelation to produce Tomb Raider: Chronicles, another moved development to the PS2 and began work on The Angel of Darkness.

The Switch itself often comes across as a fragile little device. The Joy-Con will drift, the stand will break, the rails will wobble. But never again will we say a bad word about the console's game cases; those resilient little guys can fend off the elements.
At least, that's what Reddit user DemureSow discovered last week after a fire from a power strip short circuiting engulfed their bedroom in flames. Fortunately, everyone escaped unharmed and firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze, but most of their belongings, physical game collection included, were destroyed.

It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to harvest.

Earlier this month, the current U.S. administration implemented an additional 10% tariff on all goods imported into the country from China. While the full effect of this increase is yet to be seen, it poses a potential price hike for consoles and accessories developed in China, which, naturally, is a cause for concern to both consumers and developers.
Acknowledging this, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that the company is looking into the potential impact that the tariffs could have on the upcoming financial year and the launch of the Switch 2. As reported by Reuters (and translated by Nintendo Everything), Furukawa explained in a press conference that the company is "predicting various geopolitical risks and establishing ways to respond".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. 
You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not Abyssmal.
During Sony’s February 2025 State of Play presentation, the big shadow drop was Koei Tecmo’s Warriors: Abyss, which offers a low-budget, roguelite take on the popular Warriors hack ‘n’ slash formula. The good news is that this genre hybrid feels like both halves fit perfectly together—the mindlessness of the combat mixed with the brief run-focused nature of roguelite action is so good that it almost feels hard to believe that the team never thought to produce something like this earlier. The bad news is that its struggles with repetition keep it from being anywhere near as addictive as roguelikes such as Dead Cells or Slay the Spire. Luckily, Warriors: Abyss still proves itself to be a worthwhile new entry in the series, but only just.
Warriors: Abyss begins with you being summoned by an impish little god named Enma, the king of Hell, who was recently deposed when an ancient evil being named Gouma was released and took over the land of the dead. Eager to reclaim his throne, Enma enlists the stars of the Warriors franchise to fight off Gouma’s forces and ultimately send the creature back where it came from. Every now and then, Enma will pop up with a bit more of lore or some snarky quip, but there’s not much more to the storyline beyond this basic setup.

Developer Toby Fox is back with another update on the much-anticipated Deltarune Chapter 3 and 4, inching toward an as-yet unknown release date that is still promised to come later this year.
In short, console testing is still ongoing. Our assumption here is that the Switch is included in these tests, but Fox has not specified this in the BlueSky post. Instead, he merely states that testing has yet to begin on the PS5, with a previous post stating that PlayStation trophies will need to be tested at some point due to their mandatory requirement.

Xbox games going multiplatform is old news by this point, but according to Phil Spencer, the company is looking to up its transparency during Developer Direct showcases when it comes to specifying where its games are launching.
Those paying attention during last month's Xbox dev direct may have noticed launch platforms cropping up at the end of each trailer — not that there was all that much on the Switch front, but PS5 was specifically mentioned for Ninja Gaiden 4, for example — and Xbox is going to adopt this as a common practice going forward.

The three minute, 12 second sorcerer run by Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski was first uploaded to Speed Demos Archive in 2009. Watching it "feels like watching someone win the lottery," writes Orland, thanks to a seemingly random streak of entrance and exit stairways right next to each other, allowing for a rapid, safe descent through the dungeon. Groobo lucked out again on the ninth floor, nabbing the Naj's Puzzler item needed for later teleporting exploits.

Still, can't complain, and the Switch version in particular has done pretty well, outselling PC and Xbox to claim 27% of the overall platform split. Granted, PC is barely operational in retail spaces these days, and Xbox... well, neither is Xbox, to be honest. We'll take the win, though.

I hope said test provided FromSoft with some helpful data, considering Nightreign releases in May, though it would have been a lot easier for everyone if I could’ve just sent Hidetaka Miyazaki an email saying "Sir, your server infrastructure is made of biscuits."
In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something uncanny about dipping "classic" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed has more The Outer Worlds DNA in it than just the Obsidian link, and from a technical perspective, that might be worrisome – the latter RPG’s Spacer’s Choice Edition was one of the most wretchedly broken releases of 2023.
Happily, Avowed does at least launch in much better shape, and with some genuinely fetching fantasy visuals that may even justify flicking on ray tracing. The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to "come hither" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It's also got a protagonist we can summarise as Bayonetta played straight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for Borderlands 4 in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when Grand Theft Auto 6 will not release. And that's mildly interesting.

You'll be exploring a lost space colony as Arjun Devraj, a "Soltari Enforcer" played by Midnight Mass actor and big nerd Rahul Kohli. The planet you're on is named 'Carcosa', perhaps suggesting a continuation of the cosmic horror bits that Returnal did so well.

The dispute concerns DAZN's claims that Ligue 1 football league body LFP failed to suppress piracy and fell short in other areas too. Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

Film Captain America: Nový svět (který má v úvodních titulcích pouze "Brave New World" a žádného Captaina) je pravděpodobně začátkem nové filmové megasérie, která nám v příštích filmech pravděpodobně představí "nové" Avengers, nové X-Men a pravděpodobně také nové multiverzní nebezpečí. Píšu několikrát "pravděpodobně", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign will release 30th May 2025 on Steam, developers FromSoftware and publishers Bandai Namco have announced. In a few short months, you and up to two friends will be called upon to rush a few bosses on a large, shrinking map set in the same universe as the 2022 open worlder. Is it the Elden Ring sequel many would like? No. Is it going to kindle similar feelings of frustration, despair and sporadic religious ecstasy? The omens seem good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is nice. Remedy's exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as "completely abrupt and impersonal". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

Hot like the sizzle of rain through a neon signboard as a dull-eyed redhead walks into a cyberpunk police station at 3am and starts throwing around Chandlerisms like she's boiling an egg - and you're the egg. "Information's like cash in my line of work," says the dame, who is a freelance lawyer called Morgan. "You've got to spend it to make it." She sizes up the holographic front desk, with its sprinkling of things to OBSERVE. "Let's see if I can't poke around and shake some change loose."

The days may come, and the world may spin, but you? You need only dig. A Game About Digging A Hole is a game about digging a hole.
"Hey Steam community," goes the delightfully unadorned Steam page introduction to this simulation game. "I'm Ben, and I created this game in my spare time!". I love you, Ben. Not a "play your way" in sight. Nary a "the only limit is your imagination". Absent a venomous and detestable "easy to learn, hard to master". Just a bloke named Ben, and a hole named hole.

In what can only be described as a bizarre finale,  GoTech now promotes Nagra as its partner.

As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recognition of transparency in the FADPA site blocking bill is welcome, but will it become reality? So far, many blocking regimes have lacked transparency. The true scale of site blocking action in Europe, let alone the world, is effectively proprietary information to which the public has zero access. It may be the ideal time for global site blocking to implement global transparency by default.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelike deckbuilders need to do something pretty special to stand out nowadays, what with the Slay The Spileup of bangers over the past few years. Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Finally, I thought, I would have time for some of the recent blockbusters I'd not yet played: Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and more would fill those dusty days and nights in the taint of 2024.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. "I don't know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench's games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever," responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer Duskers are making a "spiritual successor" to the 2016 space game. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sci-fi battle royale Apex Legends is due a "meaningful update" , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he's called "Apex 2.0". To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

Ah well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.
