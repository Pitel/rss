World of Goo 2 rolled onto the Nintendo Switch eShop earlier this month and following the confirmation of a physical release (due out this October), 2D Boy and Tomorrow Corporation have now issued a new update for the game.
It addresses some bugs, does some other stuff, and perhaps most notably allows players to use their Pro Controllers like a Joy-Con controller. There are also some QoL improvements to the language options. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of a post on social media:

It's footage of 'X-Men Children of the Atom' which originally made its debut in arcades back in the mid '90s, and followed with a console and PC release in the second half of this same decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25's early access is now available on both PC and consoles and once again, you can play at your preferred difficulty.


EA Sports has provided players with the option to choose between four different settings. Each difficulty has certain benefits (and cons as well). This allows players of all experiences to enjoy the gameplay without enduring too many challenges.


Can you change the difficulty in Madden NFL 25


One of the first activities in Madden NFL 25 involves choosing your preferred difficulty and control settings. If you have played Madden NFL 24, you can inherit your old settings. But you can also make changes when setting up the game for the first time.


You can also change the in-game difficulty later. Hence, there are no worries when it comes to changing difficulty in Madden NFL 25.

All difficulty settings in Madden NFL 25


Here are the four available settings.



Rookie: The easiest of four difficulty settings, Rookie is a great start for beginners and those who are picking up the franchise for the first time.


Pro: A decent experience for newer Madden players who have prior experience with the franchise but haven't played a lot.


All-Pro: This mode is a pretty difficult experience and meant for those who are well-experienced with recent Madden games. It is best to avoid for casual players.


All-Madden: The highest difficulty setting, and ideal for those who love the hardest challenges in every game. This setting is perfect only for those who have years of experience with the Madden franchise.



Do remember that you can only set difficulty for modes where you play against AI. Games against other human opponents will obviously have no set difficulties and depend on the skill level of the players.

        <updated>2024-08-12T22:20:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone meta are constantly changing, especially with the implementation of new weapons and builds. The Striker is one of those weapons rising up the ranks, taking advantage of the submachine's mobility. Here's the best loadout for the Striker in MW3 and Warzone to improve its performance.


What is the best loadout for Striker in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone?


To get the best Striker loadout in Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, equip these attachments:



Muzzle: Quartermaster Suppressor


Magazine: 48 Round Mag


Barrel: Striker Elite Long Barrel


Underbarrel: DR-6 Handstop


Rear Grip: Sakin ZX Grip



Although Striker excels in both close and mid-range attacks, it lacks recoil control and ADS speed. To compensate for this, use the Quartermaster Suppressor for easier handling and a bonus perk that makes it undetectable by radar. The Striker Elite Long Barrel also boosts recoil control, including Horizontal, Vertical, and Gun Kick.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Sakin ZX Grip is the last attachment that helps with this stat, making it almost too easy to wield this SMG. You can then improve the Striker's ADS speed by 10 percent using the DR-6 Handstop. It comes at the cost of slightly lower accuracy, but it does at least help with Mobility and Handling. That means movements and aiming will be much faster, benefiting both Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone.


As a cherry on top, increasing a gun's magazine capacity is always a good idea. I go for the more balanced ones, like the 48 Round Mag, as they don't hinder movement all that much.


Since it's an SMG, you'll likely use the Striker on smaller maps in MW3 Multiplayer or when the gas circle closes in on Warzone. But, if you want to increase its range, go for the .45 Auto High Grain Rounds to reach relatively far distances.

Even though it's a cool new addition, there are certainly times when they can run a bit long when you'd rather jump back into the game. Thankfully, players over on the /r/NCAAFBseries subreddit have figured out how to skip long halftime shows in EA Sports College Football 25.

How to skip the halftime shows in EA Sports College Football 25


To skip any halftime show in EA Sports College Football 25, simply hold the X button if you're playing on PlayStation 5, or hold the A button if you are playing on Xbox Series X|S. It's that simple. Unfortunately, there's no sort of indicator, notification, or progress bar when holding the button to skip the halftime shows, but trust us, it works!


Despite this being a rather straightforward solution for skipping halftime shows in College Football 25, many players had no idea exactly how to do it since there's no indication of how to do so anywhere in the game. For reference, similar games like Madden typically have a brief message at the bottom of the screen illustrating how to skip them.


While some of the players on the subreddit are shocked that others didn't know how to skip the halftime shows, a majority of the comments are from fans thanking user AntawnJamison for sharing the tip, while also voicing their frustration that the information wasn't more easily available.


Even though this is a very helpful tip for skipping the annoyingly long halftime shows, it doesn't appear that you can skip opening introductions when playing online. Unfortunately. there doesn't seem to be a way around this, so you'll have to simply sit through it until the game starts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 is now out on early access, and you can enjoy a free trial if you're subscribed to EA Play on either PC or console.


This offer is available to all on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (given you have an active EA Play subscription). All subscribers can enjoy up to 10 hours of unrestricted gameplay. If they decide to convert it into a full purchase at any point, they will retain all their in-game progression and also get a 10% discount on their purchase. Let's take a look at how you can enjoy the trial.


How to download the Madden NFL 25 trial with EA Play


I have EA Play on both PC and PS5, and I have downloaded the trial version on my console. While the download process should be straightforward, there are a couple of alternate methods you can use (in case the Trial doesn't appear on your end).



Go to the PS store from inside your console.


Search up Madden NFL 25.


Open the game's page, and a "Game Trial" version will be available for download (as shown in my screenshot).


If the "Game Trial" doesn't appear, go back to the PS store.


Go to Subscriptions.


Go to EA Play.


From there, go to Explore Games to find the trial. In my experience, the trial for Madden NFL 25 won't appear in this section if it already appears on the game's store page.

For Xbox users, the process is the same. If you have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, open the Madden NFL 25 store page. It will let you download the trial version. For PC users, the trial can be accessed from the Steam app or EA Play.


The early access is a really great way to enjoy all the content and test out this year's product before a full purchase. You can also enjoy the trial if you've purchased the Standard Edition. Since the Standard Edition doesn't offer any early access, the EA Play trial will let you enjoy up to 10 hours of extra gameplay prior to August 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Less than five months after the release of developer C Prompt Games and publisher Paradox Interactive's 4X title Millennia, the historical-turn-based game's first expansion, Ancient Worlds, has been released today. Released alongside the expansion is Update 5, which adds mod support and more to Millennia.




The Ancient Worlds expansion adds an all-new Nomadic Band start, allowing players to start their Millennia run as a band of unsettled travelers, scavenging the frozen terrain of the post-Ice Age world for natural resources until they feel strong enough to settle down and start their actual society. Ferocious Megafauna stalked the frozen tundra, threatening the nomadic tribes' very existence but also allowing for some unique new events and experiences.


A new national spirit, Messengers, will be available as an Age II National Spirit that puts emphasis on early game diplomacy. You can give gifts to rival nations, gather resources from minor nations, ensure their independence, and reap benefits from a new Llama special resource. Using the new Band Society starting government, you can opt to take short-term bonuses to boost your tribal camps as opposed to building up your homeland, utilizing a Nomadic Band to scavenge the terrain and settle an additional Capital Region via this new start.


With the release of Ancient Worlds, Millennia has one more DLC, Atomic Ambitions, scheduled as part of its 2024 roadmap that is expected to be released in Q4 2024. The DLC will launch alongside Update 6 which adds Steamworks Mod support, a Strategic Warfare system, Simultaneous Multiplayer, and much more.


The Millennia: Ancient Worlds expansion is available now for $9.99. For those who purchased the Millennia expansion pass, it is included with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clash of Clans has a game mode called Clan Capital, where the members of the clan can collaborate together to contribute to the clan's progress. The contributions include the repair, construction, and development of the Clan Capital.


What is Capital Gold in Clash of Clans?


The primary resource for Clan Capital is Capital Gold, which you have to collect to do the repair, construction, or upgrade of ruins or buildings that are available in the Clan Capital. Just like other virtual items, you can save Capital Gold only up to 35,000 at once.

What is additionally interesting and extremely important is the fact that each and every member of the clan can work towards the clan's progress, and there is no limit to the number of building activities that can be carried out at the same time. However, a single player can do a single construction at the same time since Capital Gold can't be split. Also, there is no build time for Clan Capital buildings once you have used sufficient Capital Gold. 


How to earn Capital Gold in Clash of Clans?


There are several ways to increase your collection of Capital Gold. Here are all the ways you can do it:



You can get Capital Gold through Seasonal Challenges after completing various tasks.


You can loot Capital Gold on Raid Weekends and certain attack challenges.


In the Forge, you can generate the Capital Gold..


You can get it through Gold Pass and Builder Boost.

The reason why everyone is talking about Omnimovement is because it's a new movement mechanic that will change how you've known Call of Duty all these years. Black Ops 6 is the first game Activision is implementing this change in, a "complete redesign from the ground up" by Treyarch.


How does Omnimovement work in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6


Unlike all previous Call of Duty games, Omnimovement will allow you to move in a 360-degree range, which means there will be endless possibilities to outplay enemies once the game launches in November 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko Fusion could possibly be the strangest crossover this year, and that includes a rabbit, a clown, and a superhero fighting in MultiVersus. To manage all the chaos this toy-inspired game brings, here are the Funko Fusion PC system requirements you'll need. 


Funko Fusion PC system requirements - all minimum specs


In order to play this crazy crossover with Back to the Future, Hot Fuzz, and Jurassic World in the same game, you'll need the following Funko Fusion PC system requirements to play the game at its lowest settings, according to Steam:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i7-4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X


Memory: 8 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470


Storage: 40 GB available space



Image via 1010 Games


Thankfully, you won't need too much storage to play Funko Fusion with only 40GB being taken. To compare that with other releases, you'll need 190GB for God of War Ragnarok and 100GB for FC 25. Funnily enough, you only need 40GB for one of Funko Fusion's main competitors Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. 8GB of RAM also makes this game accessible for most PC gamers. 


Funko Fusion recommended specs


If you want to get the best performance and visuals from Funko Fusion, you should take a look at the Steam listing's recommended specs. They include:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i7-9700K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600


Memory: 16 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT


Storage: 40 GB available space



You'll need to double the memory and upgrade your processor to run the game to how the developers imagine it. With so much happening on the screen, if the trailers are anything to go by, it will be worth the upgrade. It will be running on a Nintendo Switch, so most computers should be able to run the game.

Just Crow Things did a fantastic job at this, and I was over the moon when I was offered the chance to play through the game ahead of its official release. And boy let me tell you, ‘beautiful chaos’ is absolutely the best description you could use for Just Crow Things.

If you were lucky enough to remember Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in its heyday, you probably remember it as one of the series’ high points. Upon the release of the 2020 remaster, it was shocking that multiplayer was no longer included. Sure, the single-player campaign was great, but we all know that the multiplayer is what we really wanted. Four years later, the community's collective wishes have been granted thanks to H2M Mod.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The anticipation for the Call of Duty x The Crow crossover has been building since Season 4, fueled by a few leaks that hinted at its arrival. Although it didn't debut then, the collaboration is now in full effect with the epic teaser of The Crow's anti-hero.


The snippet reveals a few shots of Eric Draven, also known as the Crow, in his classic all-in-black ensemble. It then ends with an Aug. 22 release date, which is around the same time as Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone's Season 5 Reloaded debut.




It makes sense why Call of Duty x The Crow would drop around this time, as the new movie will launch the day after. The film reimagines the 1994 cult classic of the same name starring the late Brandon Lee. Based on the teaser, Bill Skarsgård's iteration will be the new Operator, but Lee's version could still be in the cards.


If the CoD crossover is anything like the films, it'll likely bring out some new weapons, from traditional guns to swords. Even more so, new Finishing Moves will undoubtedly be a part of it, giving you the power to take down enemies as the anti-hero. This could also involve superhuman abilities, which have been used in other crossovers like The Boys.


Besides The Crow collaboration, MW3 and Warzone Season 5 Reloaded offer plenty more content, including the final story mission for Zombies. So, get ready to clear some room for your storage around Aug. 21, as a pre-download will be available beforehand.

Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is the new multiplayer game from Portkey Games where you play as a Hogwarts student and take part in the iconic sport from the Warner Bros universe.


You can either play solo or with a group of friends in a PvP format on both last-gen and current-gen consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. If you're wondering whether you need PS Plus to play the multiplayer mode, we've got you covered.

Is PS Plus needed to play Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions multiplayer?


Yes, you must have a valid PS Plus subscription to play the Online Competitive Mode in Quidditch Champions.


However, if you're only planning to play the single-player Career Mode, you won't require PS Plus. But you don't want to restrict yourself to the single-player mode only. The real fun lies in the multiplayer mode.


The devs have confirmed that the game will be available from day one for all PS Plus members. In this case, you can play the Standard edition of Quidditch Champions and also get the Firebolt Supreme broom skin along with it.


So, if you don't want to buy a premium edition of the game, you've another way to play it on your PlayStation. You can always choose to purchase the game at a later date though.


If you're planning to get Quidditch Champions on PC, your system must meet the minimum and recommended system requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much of Fields of Mistria's charm comes from its cozy farm-life sim vibes and 90's anime aesthetic. While this initially sounds like vibes catering to a niche audience, overwhelmingly positive reviews across the board and its breakthrough into 100,000 total downloads during its first week of Early Access suggest otherwise. 




As of August 12, NCP Studio, the team behind Fields of Mistria, revealed on X/Twitter and through an official Steam announcement that the game has officially surprised 100,00 downloads in its first week of Early Access. This push into six-digit download counts, combined with its topping Steam's Top Sellers charts within its first few launch days, shows a promising start to the game's release. Fields of Mistria also reached its current all-time player count peak of over 11,000 on August 11, with over 8,000 people still actively playing.


Currently, Fields of Mistria is sitting at over 2,400 overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam at a 98 percent rating, solidifying its position as a beloved game among those who've played. Admittedly, I know several people who agree with these sentiments and are playing right now as we speak.


NPC Studio plans to keep Fields of Mistria in Early Access for around one year, with regular content updates planned throughout its development cycle. We can anticipate its full release to launch sometime in August 2025, with its main storyline, character arcs, and other miscellaneous features fully available to experience. It's currently available for $13.99 or your regional equivalent, with no current plans for a price change following its full release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TiMi Studio Group's Delta Force: Hawk Ops is currently in its alpha test, but the upcoming shooter already has additional platforms on the roadmap for when the first-person is ready to make its official launch in full. 


Delta Force: Hawk Ops is an upcoming title in the Delta Force franchise, arriving two years after Delta Force: Xtreme 2. At launch, it'll be a free-to-play tactical extraction shooter, but for now, you'll have to settle for simply watching from afar unless you're in the PC-exclusive alpha test. As for Xbox and PlayStation players, here's what the future of console support looks like. 


Image via TiMi Studio Group


All Delta Force: Hawk Ops platforms, including consoles


Delta Force: Hawk Ops will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC (via Steam and Epic Games Launcher) iOS, and Android. After Arena Breakout: Infinite, Hawk Ops will be the second extraction shooter game that you can play on mobile as well.


Will Delta Force: Hawk Ops come to PS4 & Xbox One?


At the time of writing, there's no info about Delta Force: Hawk Ops' arrival on PS4 and Xbox One consoles. So, if you want to play the game at launch, you have to download it on one of the platforms mentioned above.


However, there's always a chance of the game coming to old-gen consoles at a later date after its official release. It has happened with other games before, such as Hogwarts Legacy, where Nintendo Switch and PS4 players got to play at a much later date.


If that happens, we will update this section. In the meantime, check the Delta Force: Hawk Ops minimum and recommended system requirements before playing the alpha test on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In The Time of Ninja, your family or clan that you join gives you specific buffs and unique skills making the decision incredibly important. Thankfully, you can reroll your clan at any time. We put together a The Time of Ninja Tier List for all of the Clans so you know which one you should go for when rolling.





The Time of Ninja Clan Tier List


For the most part, you want to go for a Clan that gives you the best skills as it will assist you in all forms of content in The Time of Ninja. At the moment, one specific Clan is far above the rest, so we've put it in its own category of S+. However, after is the S Tier, of which all clans are still extremely powerful options, especially because the S+ tier Clan is rare to obtain. Those in the A Tier are formidable options that will allow you to play through most content without issue, and those in the B Tier have strengths in certain situations but overall are weaker compared to those in the higher tiers. Here is our The Time of Ninja Clan Tier List:


S+ Tier



Black Flames



S Tier



Intangible


Raven


Teleporter



A Tier



Fighter


Meteor



B Tier



Healer


Yellow Thunder



At the moment, there are also four other Clans we know are coming to The Time of Ninja: Bone, Shadow, Soul, and White Eyes. However, we don't know the exact strengths or weaknesses of these four clans at the moment, so we can't place them in our Tier List. Once these clans are released, we will update the Tier List accordingly.


Overall, you'll be fine with choosing most of the available Clans, except maybe Healer. But if you really want to strive for the best clan, you'll want to try and get those in the S Tier or even go for the almighty Black Flames clan.

One of those Halloween titles will be developed in Unreal Engine 5 and helmed by Boss Team Games, a studio already familiar with the movie-to-horror-game pipeline after creating Evil Dead: The Game.


According to an IGN exclusive report, these games will have players "relive moments from the film and play as classic characters from one of the most iconic and important horror films of all time." The Unreal Engine 5 title (an engine which Splitgate 2 also uses) is reportedly "still early in development." Both Compass International Pictures and Further Front are working alongside Boss Team Games, and John Carpenter himself will be "intimately involved" with the project.

Oxlade-Chamberlain's FUTTIES version looks like a great budget option, especially for beginners. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card, and if you should invest your resources in this challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In College Football 25, 4-star schools featured in Dynasty mode represent the very best of the lot. The all-star institutions guarantee stellar talent and can be fun saves for many. 


 These 4 and 5-star schools share a few things in common—their programs easily attract top talent, and all of them have great starting squads that push for the Championship. However, there's a gap between these schools and the top 4 (whose programs are rated at 5*).


10 best 4-star schools to pick in College Football 25 Dynasty mode


A 4-star program rating means you'll still have some work to do after choosing the school. While you'll enjoy a strong start with a solid squad and excellent ratings, climbing to the very top won't be quite as easy when compared to those starting there. 


Remember that the star rating is a composite average of your program's grades and does not reflect the squad's quality. Talented athletes exist all over, so don't bank on those program grades alone. 


School

Texas Longhorns

I really like the fact that despite having great program ratings and squads, most of the 4-star schools still offer some challenges. The Auburn Tigers might have a good program rating, but their squad has a lot of room for improvement. On the other hand, schools like Oregon Ducks and Texas Longhorns could match the best 5-star schools on the field. 


Do note that there are a few other schools on the roster with 4-star rating, but I really like these ten as the best candidates for a potential Dynasty mode save in College Football 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long awaited Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance update launches today. With this massive patch, you’ll finally be able to embark on your quest for indoctrinated followers with a friend. On top of the free co-op update, the Pilgrim Pack has also been released, containing new quests and follower forms.


I’ve never really been a voice in the push to have multiplayer incorporated into basically every game, but I also don’t care if it is. My preference to play solo is rarely affected by the option to drag someone along. I, personally, have never thought that Cult of the Lamb would be improved by the inclusion of another human, but if you did, then I’m happy for you.




Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance introduces the Goat as a second player character. While, normally, this is who the second player takes the role of, you can also slip into the skin of capra Luigi by unlocking the Goat Fleece in the crown menu. Otherwise, you can start co-op at seemingly any time through the pause menu.


Note that this is local co-op only.


Aside from the multiplayer, there is also, holy crap, a tonne of new stuff being added. Maybe check out the patch notes here for the whole slate.


Meanwhile, the Pilgrim Pack has a much more easily paste-able list of features. Here’s the paste:



The Full Pilgrim Comic Story and Bonus Pages!


Unique In-Game Questline


5 New Follower Forms: Panda, Skunk, Echidna, Anteater, Camel


2 New Outfits & 1 New Fleece: Jalala's Coat, Rinor's Robes, Fleece of the Silken Touch


5 New Decorations

The Mario Kart franchise has never really been particularly 'difficult', per se - at least not when you compare it to something like F-Zero - but there are undoubtedly moments when it feels like the whole world is against you. Indeed, the games have occasionally been labelled as "unfair" thanks to moments of relentless bad luck. Thankfully, these incidences are rare, but goodness, it can feel completely debilitating when it happens.
Take the below short clip from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, for instance, posted on X by user @ArtistRemaining. Taking place during a race on the N64 'Yoshi Valley' track, the player takes a cheeky shortcut on the third and final lap, however the speed boost from two mushrooms lying on the bridge causes the kart to careen off the side and into the void.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Hooded Horse and developer Long Jaunt have released a road map for their noble house simulation game, Norland. The plans stretch from now until October, outlining what will be added to the Early Access title.


This month will have focus on optimization, graves, and archers. September is more optimization, ranged towers, and “unique guests.” Finally, October is when we’ll see city walls and gates, barons, and usurpers.


I’m not sure how barons will come into play, but another tier of noble would definitely be appreciated. Usurpers sound interesting since Norland’s big gameplay hook is a Rimworld-like system of generation where stories develop from a chaotic interplay of the game’s mechanics.

I previewed Norland before its Early Access launch. I found that it suffered heavily from a lack of balance and progression. I wasn’t alone, as the Steam reviews show that it has a 77% positive “Mixed” rating. However, the developers have taken community feedback and made significant changes over a vast number of patches and updates (they’re on patch 17). I haven’t jumped back in to see how it affects my opinion of the game, since I want to let it marinate for a bit, but I have seen some of the issues I had with it get adjusted.


It’s hard to say if Norland will eventually become recommended playing – and city walls aren’t going to be the fix it needs – but the developers are clearly listening and putting in the work to get it in shape. And to be clear, it isn’t that bad, it just isn’t where it needs to be. The core concept of Crusader Kings meets Rimworld is a tantalizing one, and there are some great ideas found in the execution, so hopefully, it won’t be long before it reaches its potential.


Norland is available now for PC via Steam Early Access.

When I say free, I mean it in the sense that you won't need to spend anything above the game's retail price (as it's not free-to-play). This opportunity is only available for a limited period, and this year's offering is even better than usual. Unlike Heroes in EA FC 24, an upgrade system will be implemented on the base version. These base versions will be upgraded to a Prime version in the future.


The free Prime Hero is part of a limited-time EA FC 25 offer

Dating a celebrity in BitLife requires heading into your love menu under Activities and opening the Celebrity Dating app. Here, you'll find regular dating options like your desired age range and gender, alongside a new option for your preferred celebrity type.

Crossy Road Castle, the Apple Arcade platformer, has a release date for Nintendo Switch. The spin-off to the hugely popular mobile game Crossy Road — which stems from the joke "Why did the chicken cross the road?" — arrives on consoles on 11th September 2024.
Crossy Road Castle takes the "endless" aspect of Crossy Road and throws it into a co-op platformer. Instead of crossing roads, you're climbing the castle as a cast of colourful voxel animals. There are 10 different castles, with developer Hipster Whale teasing that there may be more coming along the way.

Surprising absolutely no one, the Borderlands movie has flopped at the box office with a global weekend total of - look, don't laugh, it's rude - $16.5 million.
The movie, which we completely forgot was even a thing, to be honest, launched on 9th August 2024 and scored a pitiful $8.8 million domestically on its opening weekend. Add to that a rather palty $7.7 million overseas and you've got the $16.5 million total.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steamy and challenging seas.
When we played the original SteamWorld Heist, to anyone who’d listen (and to plenty of people who wouldn’t) we described Heist as the quintessential underrated indie gem. We thought everyone should play it. We were blown away by how skillfully Thunderful Games had taken everything satisfying about X-COM-style turn-based action and made it work in 2D: the step-by-step growing tension during missions; the zen-calmness of analysing the environment and enemies and then executing decisions; the existential finality of committing to a choice and living by it.
Like a pinged sniper shot ricocheting off multiple walls into the back of a steambot head, we were blown away by the gameplay USP – the need to manually aim your shots during battles. The 2D style provided this additional mechanical twist that would have been difficult to replicate in 3D. You aim carefully, like someone lining up a golf putt. You fire. You bounce shots from walls. When you succeed, you feel good and skillful. When you miss, you grow frustrated, and you watch as your steambot, wide open now to a counterattack from a should-be-dead enemy, suffers a blast of shrapnel that tears their jolly robot body into pieces.

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

Every single flower, plant, and tree requires a different level of care; seasons and weather affect plants' growth, and some can't survive certain seasons. But, as English poet Albert Austin wrote in his book The Garden that I Love, "The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature.

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech.

Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A's bid to force Cloudflare to participate in Piracy Shield, Italy's pirate IPTV blocking system, has failed. The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has "furr-ocious spells" and "gla-meow-rous costumes".

It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When ISPs are instructed to block pirate sites, tampering with their own DNS records is often the weapon of choice. This type of blocking can be circumvented by switching to public DNS offered by companies including Cloudflare and Google. Tests carried on several ISPs in Malaysia this week reveal that requests to Cloudflare and Google public DNS servers are being hijacked and diverted to local ISP DNS servers.

Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uruguay's Ministry of Industry issued a decree in October 2022 which heralded the country's first pirate site blocking program. Since then the country has blocked over 300 pirate domains following requests from various broadcasters. Some other figures of interest; in December 2022, there were around 573,000 pay TV subscribers in Uruguay. A year later that figure had fallen to 496,000. Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internet provider Cox Communications wants a do-over of the piracy liability trial, where it was ordered to pay $1 billion in damages to the record label plaintiffs. The ISP previously argued that 'concealed' evidence warrants a new look at the case. According to the music companies, however, Cox is grasping at straws, relying on speculation in the hope of getting a do-over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mayor of a small municipality in Brazil recently hosted a public screening of the blockbuster hit "Inside Out 2". The open-air town square event was a great success, but not without critique. Watermarks on the meters-high screen showed that the public was watching a pirated copy of the film.  When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has summoned Google and Cloudflare to an official meeting to hear all about their plans to defeat piracy. The Italian Competition and Market Authority recently launched an antitrust investigation against Google, so the meeting in September will take place under dark clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

I just got done pining for the merest whiff of Dungeon Keeper when what should appear on Steam but a free prologue for delightful voxel-arty management sim Dungeon Tycoon. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more industry layoffs yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!

Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.
Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.

The developers have just released a nine-minute explainer video, which teems with scenes of gimp suits, winged vans, rocket-propelled pinkies, vicious card battles against small excited dogs, and a surprisingly in-depth management component. There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

Kletka isn't helping: created by in404, it's a horror scavenging game reminiscent of Lethal Company and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.

Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings.

It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.

As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo.

With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”

Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin spotted this game called Beta Decay that's not got a release date yet or anything, but looks very cool. It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the first Something Of Mana game to come out in 15 years, Visions Of Mana is bound to be exciting some of you out there. Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is messy. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

Each base harbours a cannister of genetic material and other resources, and the idea is to fiendishly arrange traps and defences to stop people taking your precious genmat while doing your best to clean out their bases.

He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.

Stumbling parched through a desert as a bed of scorpions prick your ankles with deadly venom? Well, Enshrouded may provide some or none of these experiences, but what its latest update does is capture their spirit. You'll now be able to choose from several difficulty presets to dampen or spice up the game's challenge. Otherwise, there's new customisation options and some quality of life tweaks, too.

        <updated>2024-07-29T11:47:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.
