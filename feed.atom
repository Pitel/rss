Well folks, the wait is over. More than seven years since its initial announcement, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has been fully revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct, and it looks incredible.
The trailer doesn't reveal too much, but we've got confirmation that many of Samus' core abilities from the original trilogy return, including the morph ball, missiles, charge beam, scanning, and the lock-on/strafe mechanic. We also got a glimpse at Sylux, the illusive antagonist who we briefly saw in Metroid Prime: Federation Force, along with a bunch of Space Pirates and Metroids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If nothing else, Workers & Resources Colon Soviet Republic will give anyone an appreciation of the incredible complexity and difficulty of building and maintaining a city. On another day I might call it the first ever city building game.
Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

A few problems remain, but it's good stuff all around, and the whole Arrowhead Games studio is to blame for this.


The concept of "blame" is, of course, quite positive in this case, and the recently self-deposed former CEO of Arrowhead Games, Johan Pilestedt, has gone on record to make sure that Helldivers 2 players understand that the great new update was a team effort through and through. Specifically, Pilestedt says he had noticed some people giving him virtually all the credit for the Viper Commandos update, and he wanted to clear the air on this matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September 2023, GameCube card-based RPG duology Baten Kaitos made its way back to a Nintendo platform with the launch of Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. While it may have been easy to miss last night's announcement, the collection is now available on Steam.


The Steam drop of the remastered set — which includes Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins — is priced at $49.99. Those who pick it up between now and July 1 will get upgraded to the Month 1 Edition, which packs the games with a digital art book. As Bandai Namco details, the art book includes "concept art, character designs, historical documents, and the latest visuals" for both games. All of the content within is in Japanese. 




Baten Kaitos series character designer Nakaba Higurashi whipped up a new illustration to commemorate the Steam release.


In addition to updated visuals, the remastered versions of the Baten Kaitos games add in some progression-focused features for those who just want to experience the story. There's the ability to turn on No Encounters so you can sail through the game without having to worry about battles. If you want to fight but don't want battles to impede progress, there's also an Instant KO setting that lets you defeat enemies in a single attack.

Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster is 10 percent off on Steam for a limited time, so if you want to grab it now, you can do so for $44.99.

I didn't until I woke up this morning, and it may just be the most bizarre gaming crossover of 2024.


I suppose it does make some sense since the crossover is specifically with the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team, whose giant Zords took the form of prehistoric creatures, like a tyrannosaurus rex and a saber-toothed tiger. It's also a mod that's completely free to download, letting you dress your character up as one of the five original Rangers, complete with unique animations, and there are even optional skins for your weapons and specific dinosaurs, turning them into the Dinozords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.]]></summary>

The publisher is broadcasting a new Nintendo Direct, airing roughly 40 minutes of news about upcoming Switch games, though there won't be any mention of the console's successor here.


Instead, what we're likely to see is the twilight roll-out of the Switch's library. A few new games, a few old ones, and maybe the return of a long-lost giant, hiding away for years in Nintendo R&D. Here's everything we saw today.

The Romancing SaGa series allows players to forge their own stories as they choose from an arsenal of main characters and expand their legacy, passing down powers and skills with each generation. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is headed to Switch on October 24, 2024.




Based on the trailer, it looks like Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven features some pretty substantial upgrades both graphically and gameplay-wise.


In Romancing Saga 2 players must oversee a Royal Court, leading an empire to longevity and prosperity by dictating its economy, technology, city construction, and magic. At its core, Romancing SaGa 2 is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.


This is another one I've yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing. It looks like a great time to finally get into it with the Revenge of the Seven remake.


Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2024.

Capcom has been really good to Ace Attorney fans over the years, delivering multiple collections - including games that have never been released in the West before — to console owners.

Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is coming to Switch on 6th September 2024 and bundles together two DS adventures starring prosecutor and fan favourite character Miles Edgeworth. Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth made it to the West back in 2010, but the sequel — Ace Attorney Investigations 2 — never left Japan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.]]></summary>

However, Elden Ring director and studio president Hidetaka Miyazaki doesn't sound keen on the idea of having every game FromSoftware makes be open world.


Ahead of the launch of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Miyazaki sat down with GameSpot to discuss Elden Ring's development and the future of FromSoftware. When asked if open world games will now serve as a new baseline for the studio, Miyazaki downplayed the possibility: "I wouldn't necessarily say that open world is going to become the new base or foundation or standard of the company. ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she's become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement on 2017. The game was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one last thing of today’s Nintendo Direct is none other than the elusive Metroid Prime 4. Announced back in (holy crap) 2017, this is the first time we’ve actually seen gameplay. It will be arriving in 2025.


I’d say I was shocked, but they had to show it at some point. The gameplay shown off looks a lot like the Metroid Prime we’ve become accustomed to. There's even series' antagonist, Dark Samus, stepping in at the end.


Samus is in her classic Varia suit (setting it before Metroid Fusion) and can roll into a ball. It looks like lock-on aiming has returned, which means it will feel natural to me. Rejoice! Scanning is back. The trailer opens with a battle between Federation soldiers and the Space Pirates, but it closes with a look at a more peaceful environment that could be taken straight from a JRPG.


Anyway, take a look for yourself:




Metroid Prime 4 is coming to Switch sometime in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearing the end of the 2024 Nintendo Direct, Spike Chunsoft, the creators of the Danganronpa series, announced their latest game, The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy. The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is arriving as a Nintendo Switch exclusive in early 2025.




Boasting Danganronpa's signature art style and narrative parallels, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- takes place in an apocalyptic world where mysterious, hostile creatures are invading. Playing as the protagonist, Takumi Sumino, your goal is to survive 100 days as you and your fellow classmates defend your school against these creatures. 


Right from the get-go, we see its resemblance to previous Spike Chunsoft games like those from the Danganronpa series. Some of the most notable similarities are the existence of a small animal mascot, the forced enrolment of 16 students in a questionable school, and the collapse of society as monsters destroy everything in their path. The premise is the same outside of the absence of murder mystery and case-solving, but its gameplay is vastly different.

Rather than being a primarily visual novel-based game, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- features a combat grid where you'll arrange your characters and defeat waves of enemies, with things getting increasingly challenging as you progress through the 100 days. While little is known about the specifics of gameplay and combat, we at least know there's some variety here. 


The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- will launch on Nintendo Switch in early 2025. No exact release date is currently known.

Nintendo has finally revealed Metroid Prime 4, and it's now called Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It's planned for release in 2025 and we've got our first look via a new gameplay trailer.
It definitely looks like classic Metroid Prime! Scanning makes a return, Sylux is causing trouble again, and all the usual hallmarks, including missiles, lock-on, and the Morph Ball are present and correct. It's incredibly cinematic though, really making use of the Switch's extra power. Though we wouldn't be surprised if this one winds up being cross-gen with the 'Switch 2'...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the previous Ace Attorney collections, Capcom is doing one for the Ace Attorney Investigations spin-off duology. Not only does this mean the two games will be available on modern hardware, but this marks the second game's debut in the West.


For context, the original Ace Attorney Investigations, which sees you play as prosecutor Miles Edgeworth as he solves crimes, came out in 2010. Its sequel launched just a year later in 2011, but only in Japan, with Capcom opting not to localise it. Fans did come together to make their own translation, but many had assumed the game would never officially come to the West.




Capcom seems eager to push Ace Attorney more nowadays, as evidenced by how all the mainline games are readily available. This includes The Great Ace Attorney duology, which was also Japan-only for many years. All in all, fans of the series are eating well.


This new collection will feature enhanced visuals, with more fluid and detail character animations, but there will be an option to switch to the original graphics as seen in the DS versions. Obviously, this won't be a Switch exclusive and will also launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Pre-orders are already available for the collection, which is scheduled to launch on September 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of a Zelda remake, which some fans may have expected, Nintendo surprised everyone with a brand new series entry, putting players in the princess's shoes instead. 


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom announcement trailer started like any previous installment. Link battles off a horde of enemies to free Zelda from a crystal. However, this time around, Link gets sucked into a strange rift, and this time it's up to Zelda to step up to the plate and save Hyrule. Instead of wielding a sword, Zelda wields a mysterious staff that can duplicate items called echoes. Once the princess learns an echo of something she can re-create it however many times you like to help traverse the map and move past obstacles. 




Wooden boxes, old beds, tables, and water blocks are just a few items Zelda can use. The first trailer gives players a first look at how the duplication system works. For example, Zelda duplicated multiple beds to scale a wall. Instead of traditional combat, the staff can create echoes of monsters, and each enemy has a unique set of abilities that can be used for different situations. Nintendo set out to create an experience that will be different for players, based on how they decide to use echoes. 


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on September 26, 2024. Nintendo also announced a new Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule edition to celebrate the new title that will also be available on the same date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2024 Nintendo Direct revealed the latest installment to the Mario Party series, Super Mario Party Jamboree. Fortunately, you won't have to wait too long to jump into the friendship-making (and destroying) actions with your friends, as it's releasing this year on October 17, 2024.




Super Mario Party Jamboree is the biggest game to launch in the series yet, with over 110 minigames, seven game boards, and up to 20-player support in an exclusive Koopathlon mode. You'll jump onto an island resort and, much like previous games in the series, travel around the board to sabotage your friends and claim the most stars to win the match. It also features mostly new game boards, with two from the first two Mario Party games, Mario's Rainbow Castle and Western Land, making a grand return.


Super Mario Party Jamboree will be released as a Nintendo Switch exclusive on October 17, 2024.

        <updated>2024-06-18T14:37:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a lot of exciting news for retro gamers in the Nintendo Direct. One that got me good was the reveal of the Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection. This collection brings together such out-of-reach licensed classics as The Punisher and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.


Okay, here’s the trailer:




And here’s the list of games. Capitalization is all Capcom marketing:



X-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM


MARVEL SUPER HEROES


X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER


MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER


MARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES


MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes


THE PUNISHER



This is extremely exciting to me. I’m always thrilled when old licensed games get re-released because I know it’s often a lot of hoops for the publisher to jump through. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is probably the top of the heap, but that doesn’t mean that the others included aren’t great on their own. 


The more obscure entry here is The Punisher.  Rather than a fighting game,  it's a beat-’em-up where you play as the eponymous anti-hero and Nick Fury. It’s no Alien vs. Predator (hopefully, one day), but it’s appropriately violent and an excellent arcade title.


It comes with some bells and whistles, too. There will be Online modes with rollback netplay, and training modes for all the fighting games. There is also a spectator mode, a jukebox, and screen filters.


Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be released later this year for Switch, PS4, and PC.

Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was teased a few weeks ago by Square Enix, but during today's Nintendo Direct, we got oh, so much more news than just the one game.
First up, Dragon Quest III HD-2D will be launching on Switch on 14th November 2024. This one was initially revealed in the Dragon Quest 35th anniversary celebrations back in 2021, though recent rumours surrounding the game's contents had us wondering whether it might pop up soon enough. And pop up it has. The new trailer gives us another look at the stunning HD-2D visuals and showcases some of the animation changes that we'll be able to catch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the newest Nintendo Direct, four fan-favourite classics were confirmed to be coming to the Nintendo Switch's online service. And best of all, they're dropping later today.


The first two are a pair of Game Boy Advance games: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission for Game Boy Advance. The former is a compilation title that includes a GBA remake of the beloved SNES game A Link to the Past, and a multiplayer spin-off that sees four Links team up and explore randomised dungeons. This will allow for online co-op.

As for Metroid: Zero Mission, it's a GBA remake of the very first Metroid game, letting you experience an updated re-telling of Samus' first adventure. It may not be as fancy looking as Metroid Prime 4, but it's still worth playing.


The other two additions are a pair of Nintendo 64 games: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Rare's original Perfect Dark. Both of these are first-person shooters, with Turok being all about, well, hunting dinosaurs, while Perfect Dark is set in an alternate future where agent Joanna Dark goes on a mission to thwart an evil corporation. Perfect Dark will also feature online multiplayer. These two will be exclusive to Nintendo's new catalogue of mature rated titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at the Dragon Quest 3 2D-HD remake. We also have a release date: November 14, 2024.


Were you betting on the original trilogy of Dragon Quest games getting a remake? Good news! The other two games are also getting remade, but they aren’t part of the same collection. Dragon Quest 1&2 2D-HD will be coming sometime in 2025.




I’m not sure there’s much else to say. It’s a remake of the third Dragon Quest game in Square’s 2D-HD style. It’s a foundational JRPG, so maybe play it if you haven’t before.


Honestly, Dragon Quest 3 was probably my least favorite of the four NES titles. I think it just felt really long and kind of drab. It’s still good, and I’ll definitely be getting the HD-2D remake. I’m just happy that the first two are also getting the treatment.


Dragon Quest 3: 2D-HD is coming to Switch on November 14, 2024. Dragon Quest 1& 2 2D-HD will arrive after in 2025.

Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive which launched in 2023, it won Game of the Year on the service and is one of the most successful and popular games there. Now it's finally making the leap to consoles next year, and of course, Switch is the first port of call. Which makes sense, given the cute and cuddly vibes.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among Us fans on Nintendo Switch, rejoice! Three new roles, two for Crewmates and one for Impostors, are being added to the game as part of a free update on June 18. 


Announced during the jam-packed Nintendo Direct, Crewmates can now end up with the Noisemaker or Tracker roles, while the new Phantom role for Impostors will make it even harder for your opponents to sus you out. 


Noisemakers will be able to send out a signal to everyone in the game that they've been killed, so there's no way they can be silently eliminated by the bad guys. Elsewhere, the Tracker will be able to plant a tracking device on other players and watch their movements using the in-game map. 


For those who end up as Impostor, the Phantom role will allow you to turn invisible, which will be very handy for evading Crewmates after a kill, or sneaking into position for your next assassination.

These three roles were first teased back on April Fool's Day, appearing briefly in the lobby during the video. The roles aren't actually live on PC or console just yet, which means that if you want to play them, you'll need to break out your Switch to give them a go. 


The Phantom definitely seems like the most powerful of the lot, with the ability to turn invisible definitely going to lead to some awesome plays. The Tracker could also be useful if there's a player you don't trust, although giving away information that contradicts them could make you a prime target for their knife.


The new Among Us roles are just one of many big announcements at June 18's Nintendo Direct, including the new Mario & Luigi: Brothership and an HD version of Donkey Kong Country Returns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2024 Nintendo Direct, Douze Dixiemes and Focus Entertainment revealed a first look at their latest upcoming game, MIO: Memories in Orbit. MIO: Memories in Orbit is a 2D Metroidvania that is planning to be released in 2025 as a Nintendo Switch exclusive.




In the beautiful, vast landscapes of space, Mio: Memories in Orbit has your character, the android MIO, set out to explore the galaxy and its wonders. As MIO breaks out of its wire-covered vessel and steps foot into the world, you'll battle enemies, use your grappling hook-like abilities to climb around the terrain, and avoid various deadly obstacles to discover new areas in the universe and save your spaceship from a growing hostile force.


Diving into its gameplay more, the world premiere reveals multiple terrain traversal methods you'll use, from a light beam acting as a grappling hook to pull you through the air to gliding, multi-jumps, and basic combat attacks. You'll use these various mechanics to defend and evade against enemies as well as avoiding challenging traps that require careful navigation.


Mio: Memories in Orbit will be available on the Nintendo Switch in 2024. No exact release date or time is currently known.


This story is currently developing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when Nintendo brought Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze to the Switch? Well, now its predecessor, Donkey Kong Country Returns, is making the leap as well in early 2025.


Originally released in 2010, this marks the second time Donkey Kong Country Returns has seen a port, since Nintendo put it on the Nintendo 3DS as well in 2013. This Switch version seems to be a simple HD port of the original Wii game, but it will include the extra levels from the 3DS version as well.




Aside from that, it doesn't appear to boast any wholly new features or content. Couch co-op is obviously still included, letting two players control DK and Diddy as they embark on a quest to get their bananas back from the Tiki Tak Tribe. No mention of online co-op though.


Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is scheduled to launch on January 16, 2025.

Officially titled Fantasian Neo Dimension for the console version, the port is an enhanced version of the original with brand new features including English and Japanese voiceovers and a new difficulty option, and is scheduled to release in winter this year.




In Fantasian Neo Dimension, players take on the role of Leo as he tries to recover his memories and solve the mystery of a strange mechanical infection that is destroying is homeworld. Fantasian features a modernized take on turn-based combat and a handful of unique mechanics that shake up the classic formula.


Written by Hironobu Sakaguchi and with music by Noubo Uematsu, I've been interested in Fantasian since it was announced years ago. However, being exclusive to Apple Arcade has prevented me from getting a chance to play it, so I'm glad I'll finally be able to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d recognize that Luigi design anywhere. As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Mario & Luigi Brothership was announced. It has a November 7, 2024 release date.


They point out that this is the first new Mario & Luigi in almost 9 years. It’s also the first one since AlphaDream filed for bankruptcy. So, that’s kind of sad. Here’s the trailer:




It shows off a lot of staples of the series. Both Mario and Luigi, for example. There are action commands in its battles that take the form of little mini-games. There’s also some great looking platforming. The environments look nice.


I’m going to be real: I have never completed a Mario & Luigi game. This isn’t really important to say because I don’t think they’re bad, they just don’t jive with me. I’ve played a few, and nope, none of them have clicked. In any case, I’m mostly just wondering if any of AlphaDream’s staff are working on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant's latest update addresses netcode issues plaguing multiplayer matches since launch and expedites the weapon leveling process. Here is everything you need to know about the brief patch notes. 


Ubisoft has had its hand full lately. On June 12, an update finally added an aiming penalty for players who spam jumped. In addition, sniper rifles finally recieved a nerf as XDefiant increased flinch when getting fired at. As a result, it's harder for sniper rifle users to shake off bullets. As for this time around, the update takes care of other issues that have been raised over the past few weeks.  


XDefiant June 18 patch notes


Image via Ubisoft 


Gameplay


Sped up the process of unlocking weapon attachments by lowering the amount of XP needed to level up your primary weapon, from 3,500 to 3,000, and your secondary weapon, from 1,500 to 1,000. This change is retroactive, meaning your existing weapon levels will likely be even higher now. Pause for polite applause.


To counterbalance this speedier access to performance-enhancing attachments--and provide a greater challenge to the community--Weapon Mastery level requirements have increased. However, any player who has already unlocked Bronze/Silver/Gold skins will get to keep them. We're not monsters.


Netcode


Improved how quickly your health reacts when being shot, which should reduce the feeling of being shot behind walls.


Weapons


Players wielding the MDR while strutting around in the Firestorm skin were experiencing an abnormal level of recoil, which has been reset to normal recoil. So strut away.


Factions


Restored the decorum of lying down when dead to players who previously remained on their feet after dying while under the influence of Libertad's Medico Supremo ultra.


Miscellaneous


Additional crash fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Nintendo Direct, Sunblink announced that their hit Apple Arcade game Hello Kitty: Island Adventure is leaving behind its mobile exclusivity and coming to Switch and PC (followed later by PS4/PS5 a bit later) in 2025.


If you’re unfamiliar with Hello Kitty Island Adventure, it’s a life simulator starring Sanrio’s ubiquitous cast of cute characters. It’s maybe in the same wheelhouse as Animal Crossing, but not entirely. My Melody (that’s a character) is opening a store in a theme park on a tropical island, and you have been brought along to help. But the park is abandoned, and the trip can only be saved with the power of friendship.




There’s a character creator. You can decorate your friendship cabin. There’s baking. The press blurb says it’s over 100 hours, and I believe them. More importantly: there are no microtransactions. It’s been getting updated with new content since it was first released on iOS.


Hello Kitty: Island Adventure was really well received on Apple Arcade. It was nominated at The Game Awards 2023 for Best Mobile Game, if you remember. It lost to Honkai Star Rail because there’s no justice in our world, but it did win the Webby People’s Choice award as well as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year Award. Kitty’s got papers.


Hello Kitty: Island Adventure is coming to Switch and PC sometime in 2025. It will also arrive on PS4 and PS5 sometime later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VALORANT can be cursed by many different glitches and errors, but perhaps none are as frustrating as the VAN 82 issue that locks you out of the game. If you're suffering, here's everything we know about it, and what you can do to try and fix it. 


This issue raised its head again on June 18, with VAN 82 making it impossible to log into the game. Unsurprisingly, players aren't too happy about this and want to know what's stopping them from getting into matches and dominating their opponents. (Although for me, it's more likely to get stomped.)


Not what you want to see. Screenshot via Destructoid


What does VAN 82 mean in VALORANT?


Essentially, VALORANT's VAN 82 error means that there is a problem connecting to the game's servers. This could be on your side, or on Riot's side, but more often has to do with the game's developer. 


When you see VAN 82, you're not getting into a match, as the game tells you that it's "encountered a connection error." 


How to fix VAN 82 in VALORANT


If the problem is on Riot's end, then the bad news is that you can't do anything about it, and just have to sit tight and wait for the developer to fix it. In the meantime, keep an eye on the official server status page and wait for updates. 


If, however, the servers are up and you're still struggling to get into games, here are a few things to try:



Restart your VALORANT client: This is the fix suggested by Riot, and the easiest to do. 


Restart your PC: If your Vanguard is having an issue, sometimes restarting your PC is the best way to address it. 


Restart your internet: If you can't get into matches, it could be worth giving your entire network a reboot, just to knock out any gremlins. 


Try a different server: If nothing is working, then a different VALORANT server may help you get into the game. 



Hopefully, some of these tips will help you out, and get you back in the game as soon as possible.

You'll find Trots in the laundry room. While this area was easy enough to get through before, it's since been turned upside down, and now a mutated Trots sits at its center, slamming a washing machine. He's incredibly angry about all the things on the rig that aren't working, including those making random noises around him. This is where Still Wakes the Deep teaches you the mechanics of how to get past its enemies, but it's far from simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's nothing worse than jumping on your PC to play a game of VALORANT just to find that the servers are down, but thanks to the VAN 84 error that is plaguing Riot's FPS, that's what's happening. 


The error is appearing whenever you try to boot up the game, greeting you with a screen that reads: "Connection error. VALORANT has encountered a connection error. Please relaunch the client to reconnect." Unfortunately, even if you close down the client and try again, you'll be met with the same problem. 


Even worse, it's not clear what's causing this issue right now, as Riot has yet to comment on it to confirm that they're aware of it or working on a fix. Speculation is running rife that it could be linked to VALORANT's Vanguard anti-cheat system, but this is unconfirmed.

So far, it's been radio silence from Roit, with nothing on their official X account about the outage. Even their official server status page fails to mention the problem, leaving us all in the dark about what's going on. 


Unsurprisingly, social media is filled with unhappy VALORANT players asking the developer what's going on, and pleading for them to fix the problem. It's not just the FPS that's affected either, with League of Legends players also complaining on X about the VAN 84 error. 


For now, there's not much we can do but sit tight and wait for Riot to fix the problem. We'll be sure to update this article as soon as we hear anything from the developer, or the servers are restored. In the meantime, sign up for the VALORANT console limited beta so you try the game on a new platform when the servers are finally up.

Atari and WayForward Technologies have announced that the upcoming Metroidvania Yars Rising will be heading to the Nintendo Switch on 10th September 2024.
Initially announced during an Indie World showcase, Yars Rising is a brand new take on the classic Yars franchise, which began all the way back in 1982 with Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600. The new game goes in a decidedly different direction from the original, utilising WayForwards' flair for character-led adventure games by combining stealth mechanics with comprehensive hacking minigames.

        <updated>2024-06-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and Wayforward have announced that Yars Rising, a spin-off/reimagining of the 1981 Atari 2600 title, Yars’ Revenge has a release date of September 10, 2024. They’ve also released a new trailer that covers the gameplay in better detail.


Announced back in April, Yars Rising is a gated exploration (Metroidvania) game that bases itself on Yars’ Revenge. It’s a weird way to reimagine a fixed-screen shooter from the early days of home games. While the initial trailer didn’t really show much relation to the original beyond some visual references, both the demo and the trailer show a more distinct link. I’m talking about the hacking mini-games that are essentially new configurations of the classic Yars’ Revenge gameplay.




It’s a better trailer overall, though I’m still not sold on the aesthetic. I say that as someone who actually likes Yars’ Revenge. However, Joseph Luster tried out the demo and came to the same conclusion that he’s curious, but not wild about the game. I’m just not seeing much of a hook here.


Yars Rising still fits into Atari’s business model of adapting old licenses into smaller-budget games. So far, a lot of what I’ve experienced from the initiative is solid but unremarkable. However, with the resurrection of the Infogrames label and Nightdive and Digital Eclipse at their side, they aren’t restricting themselves to one strategy. It’s a lot better than what we had a decade ago when they last tried to resurrect Yars Revenge and Star Raiders.


Yars’ Rising will be released for Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC on September 10, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncharted 2 movie is officially in development, as confirmed by Sony’s president of international distribution Steven O’Dell, who gave the update during the 2024 CineEurope trade show, as reported by Variety.


For those unfamiliar, the first movie and its now-confirmed sequel are video-game adaptations of Sony and Naughty Dog’s Uncharted franchise. The first movie, released in 2022, starred Tom Holland as protagonist Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan, Drake’s best friend, was played by Mark Wahlberg.


Both of the characters are expected to reprise their role. Wahlberg’s return seems to be almost confirmed, given that the actor provided an update earlier this year in an interview with Screen Rant. He revealed that the studio asked him to start growing his moustache. The actor also shared that the movie’s script is done.




Wahlberg said that the “audiences really loved the first one” which is partly a fair assessment. The movie did earn $407 million at the box office, but it didn’t receive the kind of reviews that complement its gross earnings. As it stands, Uncharted has a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a 6.3 score on IMDb, and a 45% rating on Metacritic.


Regardless, the performance at the box office is strong enough for Sony to greenlight a sequel, and it remains to be seen how Uncharted 2 will perform upon release. However, it is still early to wonder about its reception as the movie is currently under development and with no official confirmation that Tom Holland is returning, it will be some time before Uncharted 2 hits the theatres.

I normally wouldn’t let such an opaque stub of a description survive outside of a quick Trello reminder to write something better later, but I’m currently finding it fulfilling enough just to gaze upon that title and consider the fully formed art object that may soon emerge from its tantalising promises. Ok, so the visual component helps too. Orientate yourself by means of the trailer below, and let’s dig into this brazen nose-hooker of a head turner of a game that does exist, about another game that doesn’t.

With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The latest UK Charts are here and it's a resounding success for the newly released Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, which beats the likes of EA Sports FC 24 and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door to claim the top spot. Naturally, the game fared better on PS5, but the Switch performed admirably, pulling in a total of 27% of the overall sales.
Elsewhere, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Bros. Wonder maintain their presence in the top 10, while Minecraft is just about hanging in there after slipping from number 8 to number 10. Further down the list, Tears of the Kingdom has seen a slight boost in sales to land at number 17, while Mario vs. Donkey Kong climbs the vines to settle in at number 22.

In brief, here's what he had to say - noting how "everything" at the start of the game would likely be disappointing for players (courtesy of a rough translation by Nintendo Everything):

Remember last year when Bandai Namco announced a new in-house development team 'Studio 2 & Studio S' for commissioned projects - with Nintendo series like Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart seemingly a big part of the plans? After advertising for multiple roles, it appears there's been a small development.
As spotted by 'Stealth' on social media platform 'X', it looks like certain roles tied to "Nintendo games" are no longer being promoted, which suggests Nintendo has "probably" filled these positions.

The former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata had an incredibly positive impact on the video game industry during his lifetime, and it seems FromSoftware's current president (and Elden Ring game director) Hidetaka Miyazaki has drawn from the teachings of this Nintendo legend.
Speaking to PC Gamer recently about the "brutal waves" of industry layoffs so far this year, Miyazaki cited the "old ex-president of Nintendo, Iwata-san", who took a 50 percent pay reduction during his time at the helm of the company, to ensure Nintendo's employees could focus on "making good things".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.]]></summary>

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don't care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced its previously confirmed summer Direct will air tomorrow, June 18. The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.
The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

June 17, 2024
With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company's fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it's likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-17T14:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

These deployable skills or equipment drops were broadly swept under the rug as Helldivers 2’s balance was thrown out of whack by frequent patches, much to the chagrin of the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RPS inbox is a wondrous treasure-trove of distraction doubloons, some delightful, some shite-ful, and not even Outlook’s lichen-like interface can dull the luster of its offerings. In amongst the press releases, indie nuggets, and the occasional pitch for sponsored AI content (no, never), something truly exquisite occasionally peeks through the chest lid. This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct," the Dual Rulers announcement reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer."
Here's a look at Dual Rulers' key art:

        <updated>2024-06-14T12:40:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi "Suda51" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has "auto rock on," an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…]]></summary>

When I first played Astro's Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game's short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …]]></summary>

Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

Growing up, I didn't spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phantom Line, the PVE co-op shooter formerly known as Hornet, has an early demo available until the 18th of June, 2024. It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former Cyberpunk 2077, Bioshock, and Borderlands devs among their ranks. The FPS lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mental Salvo describes itself as having an "infinite open world" in which you can do so many things, "they're impossible to list". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that's okay, we are expert curators. Here's a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole.

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.” 
That sentiment was shared by Graham Parkes, who wrote Before Your Eyes and now serves as creative director and writer at Nice Dream. He a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not Silversun. Sit down, Brian. Let somebody else have a go at answering. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer"/>
        <updated>2024-06-12T12:26:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.

If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 here.

Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.
A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid strategy antics of Metal Slug Tactics ever since it was first announced. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

FACEMINER captures both of these things well, as it sees you build a biometric data processing empire from scratch.

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

You can read our extensive preview breaking down these sequences here, or you can watch how each of these assassins use their respective talents to relieve enemies of their lives in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed has been threatening to go to Japan for so long that I think the idea has lost its thunder, but I’ll admit to a squee of enthusiasm, during our first look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows, when deuteragonist Naoe grappled onto the ceiling to allow a castle guard to pass innocently beneath. I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.


It opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Divine Trials" DLC is now available to all players for free, and it brings with it revisited boss fights, puzzle and platforming challenges, new amulets and outfits, and more. Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below: 


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hit PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC back in January, and it's one of our favorite games of the year. Read why in Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here. After that, check out these four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the Metroidvania genre right, and then watch our guide on how to beat the game's hardest platforming challenge.

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Yet, according to a new lawsuit filed by the world's largest educational publishers, their situation could hardly be worse. They accuse Google of promoting pirate sites, profiting from piracy, and giving pirates preferential treatment, in part by limiting publishers' ability to advertise legal products.

Come at me, God! What have you got? Ah. It’s Ale Abbey, a management game about brewing beer in a monastery of medieval monks, and between making craft ales the priests get tipsy on their own supply. You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works on GameJolt for 2 years. But, yes, I suppose now that the developer is teaming up with the Northgard creators as a publisher, the people must know.

It's out 8th October 2024, and sees you hooting and hollering down the road to the new region of Nahantu in search of Neyrelle, a character "who is both suffering the fate of her choice to imprison the Prime Evil Mephisto, and seeking a means to destroy him". In the process, you may choose to become "the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class". You can also recruit mercenaries to help you, fight alongside other players in a new PvE co-op activity, "and more".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of a copyright infringement lawsuit against DoodStream, the cyberlocker platform was handed orders by a court in India to remove links to all content owned by the major Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, within 24 hours. When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its no-holds-barred 'dynamic+' injunctions, capable of blocking sites perpetually and forcing domain seizures in the U.S., India's emergence as a global copyright enforcer is remarkable.
