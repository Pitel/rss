        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 has multiplayer matchmaking across many game modes, and most of them match you with a random stranger. But there's an easy way to play with or against your friend, and you can make it as casual or competitive as you want.


Setting up an online friendly can be slightly challenging if you haven't done so in the past. That said, the process is precisely the same as other EA sports titles like EA FC 24 and College Football 25. Let's take a look at the detailed steps of playing an online game with your buddy.


How to play Madden NFL 25 with your friends


As I said, playing a friendly mode is pretty straightforward.



Open the game and load it up.


Go to the Online H2H mode.


Choose the Play a Friend option.


Your EA app overlay will open, showing all your available friends.


If you want to play with your friend, you'll need to add them to the EA app and get their username/ID.


Once you send them a request, they must accept it (or they could send you the request, and you must accept it).


Once added, your friend will be visible on the EA app overlay. Just send them a request, and they will be able to matchmake with you.

You can tweak many in-game settings before proceeding with the friendly mode. This includes the Game Style (I prefer it to be Competitive when playing with another human opponent) and other aspects like quarter length, injuries, etc.


You can also opt to play with a custom squad if the two of you want something different from the default. To do so, you can change the depth chart of your selected lineup. While you can't win any rewards from these friendly games, it's a fun way to spend time for sure.

That would exclude a massive number of games with slow build-ups, which are just as rewarding. However, I do appreciate it when a game wields its introduction effectively.


From Jake Armitage kicking his way out of a drawer at the morgue in Shadowrun for the SNES, to the death and return of Commander Shepard in Mass Effect 2, these moments can live on in my brain, even if the rest of the game is a blur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Black Myth: Wukong is similar to other Soulslike games, at least on the surface, it's not at all strange to be curious if it has multiplayer as a feature. The challenging combat and intricate boss battles seem well-suited for cooperative or competitive play, but is it actually present here?


Can you play Co-op Multiplayer in Black Myth: Wukong?


There is currently no co-op or multiplayer feature in Black Myth: Wukong, and it is very likely to remain the case at release and into the future.


Despite being commonly compared to Souls titles (games that do typically have multiplayer, and a semi-open world, not always though), Black Myth: Wukong is not strictly pursuing that style. While the thought of having two transforming, spirit-throwing Sun Wukongs on screen at the same time sounds interesting, the game seems designed solely as a single-player experience. 


Image via Game Science


Black Myth: Wukong is based on and inspired by the classical Chinese adventure novel Journey to the West, and while there are plenty of characters in the story that could potentially make a co-op experience work, I have no doubt it would be a very tricky endeavor to pull off successfully. The story itself is extremely long, and characters come and go throughout the adventure on a consistent basis.


Adding a co-op mode to the game would require careful consideration of character balance and narrative cohesion. The game's primary focus is on the singular journey of Sun Wukong, and introducing multiple playable characters could risk diluting the depth of his story. However, if done right, it could offer a fresh way to experience the tale, allowing players to explore different perspectives and abilities while maintaining the integrity of the original narrative. Alas, this is not to be in Black Myth: Wukong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hooded Horse and Untitled Studio has announced that its upcoming smithing simulator game, Blacksmith Master, is hitting Early Access on PC on September 26, 2024.


A blacksmith simulator seems like such an obvious concept to me. It’s just so easy to gamify. It’s practically in a slew of crafting sims already. A cursory search on Steam suggests it’s already trodden territory. So, I almost overlooked Blacksmith Master until I took another glance.




Rather than simply being a game where you take resources and produce items, Blacksmith Master is, in part, a management game. You’re in charge of the whole production chain. You hire people, build workshops and stores, and unlock new recipes. There’s a building tool, so you actually get to design what you’re facilities look like. There are over 100 items to craft, from tools to weapons. If you’re looking for something more hands-on, there’s a direct control mode.


It’s a lot deeper than I expected. I was envisioning something more akin to Supermarket Simulator, where there isn’t much depth, but it tries to make up for that with breadth. This is closer to… I want to say it’s like Pizza Connection, but at this point I think I’m just fixated on something capturing the spirit of that game.


Anyway, I love a good business sim, so hopefully, this will scratch one of my many itches. Gosh, I’m so itchy.


Blacksmith Master is out in Early Access via Steam, GOG, and Epic on September 26, 2024.

        <updated>2024-08-16T18:36:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, the waves of layoffs at Ubisoft Entertainment continued this week with 45 jobs being cut from its San Francisco and Cary, North Carolina offices. Paired with previous layoffs earlier this year at Ubisoft Toronto as well as in its global publishing and Asia-Pacific teams, Ubisoft is approaching a total reduction in headcount of over 1,800 since 2022.





The layoffs come less than a month after Ubisoft reported first-quarter 2024-25 net bookings of €290.0 million, €15.0 million more ahead of its target for the quarter. According to Ubisoft's public Investor report regarding Q1 sales, the company had a 'Solid start to the year with Q1 net bookings ahead of target' and 'Robust engagement metrics driven by our GaaS franchises.' The report also mentions a strong upcoming release slate with Star Wars Outlaws set to release on August 30, 2024, and Assassin's Creed Shadows targeting a November 15, 2024 release date.


A Ubisoft spokesperson issued a statement that the "difficult yet necessary decision was made to align these studios' organizations with their future business and development objectives." The spokesperson also indicated that the affected employees will receive severance and career assistance.


Ubisoft's website indicates that there are 21,000 employees and more than 45 development studios and business offices around the world. The Ubisoft Cary team had recently been working on Assassin's Creed Nexus VR and the recently canceled The Division Heartland. Ubisoft San Franciso typically works on a variety of projects including the Rocksmith series and recently released free-to-play shooter xDefiant.

        <updated>2024-08-16T18:24:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mallory Swanson FUTTIES is the first 99-rated card in EA FC 24 which has been introduced as a special objective set for all to complete. 


This is excellent news as the card looks amazing, and you can have her for free. All you've to do is to complete all the tasks that are part of the objective set before it expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at all the tasks that you'll need to complete, and why you should put in the efforts to get the card. 


EA FC 24 Mallory Swanson FUTTIES objective tasks


As expected, the Mallory Swanson FUTTIES objective has four different tasks in EA FC 24. You can complete the tasks in any order you want, but some of them will end quicker. 



Game Winner: Score 6 Finesse goals in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Visionary Assist: Assist 5 goals with Through Balls in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi- Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 7: Play 7 matches in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the United States in your starting 11.


Gold Medal Champion: Win 6 matches in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the United States in your starting 11.



To complete the tasks, your best bet is Squad Battles. Playing against AI is lot easier than doing so against other human opponents. In Squad Battles, you can also control the difficulty of the AI in case you can't field your best lineup (to meet the requirements of the objective task). 


This Mallory Swanson's 99-rated version looks phenomenal. It has 99 Pace and 98 Dribbling along with 5* Skills/5* Weak Foot. She has four great playstyle+, including Finesse Shot and Rapid. The base Shooting (94) and Passing (92) can be boosted to get better results. For a free card, this is a really good item to unlock and add to your team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Salvage mechanic returns with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 for the Zombies mode. It's a must-have in-game currency that you should stock as much as possible, to craft and upgrade items.


Salvage was first introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War in 2020. After that, it was seen as an Uncommon item only in Call of Duty: Vanguard and is set to make a complete return with Black Ops 6 in October 2024.


This item has multiple uses in the upcoming title and you must know how to use it effectively, as survival is the key in Zombies mode.

What is Salvage in Black Ops 6 Zombies and how does it work?


In Black Ops 6 Zombies, Salvage is a type of currency that drops as Ground Loot after slaying zombies. Like some previous Call of Duty games, they appear as "small piles of junk with a green outline."


It's the second in-game currency after Essence, and has three uses:



Craft Ammo Mods using the Arsenal Machine


Craft Equipment at a Crafting Table


Upgrade the Rarity Tier of weapons



You can craft all sorts of Equipment using Salvage. This includes Tactical, Lethal, and Support equipment. You will pick up this item automatically while walking or running over them.


When it comes to upgrading weapon rarity, you get four tiers – Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), Epic (Purple), and Legendary (Orange). The higher tier you opt for, the more the Salvage you'll need to spend. So, collect as much as you can (kill as many zombies as possible).


Activision has confirmed that, unlike Black Ops Cold War, you only need to manage a single type of Salvage. The title from 2020 featured two types of Salvage – Normal and High-Grade.


Now that you know how Salvage works, check how to get into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta to try it first-hand.

Slightly nerfed, mind.


More specifically, Massive Monster is looking to memorialize Cult of the Lamb's second birthday by re-releasing the Cthulhu follower form for free to everyone playing the game on August 16. I say 're-release' because some may recall that the Cthulhu form isn't actually new, but an old pre-order bonus that was left ignored up until now. We'll now be able to reclaim him, alongside a suite of appropriately festive anniversary goodies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True stealth games are few and far between nowadays, and whether that's for good reason or not, it sure is a shame that this is the case. Happily, Intravenous 2 is here to help, featuring the sort of gameplay you'd expect out of Splinter Cell instead of a top-down shooter.


I'm really not joking here, either: Intravenous 2 is about as hardcore as one of these games could possibly get. Guns are loud, bodies are heavy, and the enemies are... well, generally perceptive. Featuring elements of Hotline Miami's gritty and grimey storytelling with a layer of remarkably complex stealth slathered on top, this is one of those games you generally need to see in action to believe. 


The good news, then, is that Intravenous 2 is pretty darn cheap at just about $19 as its base asking price. On top of t…]]></summary>

However, that doesn't mean we should forget about some of the classics. This even includes a weapon you can get from a surprisingly common source. Here are the best perks and attachments for the Escape Velocity submachine gun in Destiny 2.

It's important to note that while these combos are the best, you can't just slap them on and completely transform your gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws comes out this month, and a free Nix Tail Wrappings cosmetic is already up for grabs. Here's how to get the cosmetic, ahead of Ubisoft's open-world adventure.


First and foremost, you must be a resident of the United States. People from other regions unfortunately cannot get this free cosmetic. Secondly, you must have a valid Disney+ subscription.


Nix is the Merqaal companion of Kay Vess, the protagonist of Ubisoft's upcoming action-adventure title. Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 30, and it will let you venture all across a galaxy far, far away, Nix in tow.

How to get free Nix Tail Wrappings in Star Wars Outlaws


You must have your Disney Plus and Ubisoft accounts associated with the same email address. Once you've got that sorted, follow these steps to get the in-game item:



Head over to Ubisoft's official redemption website.


Log in to your account and then hit the "Claim" button.


Once the eligibility check is done, the Nix Tail Wrappings will be automatically added to your account.



The cosmetic will add a luminous cloth to Nix's tail. A nice little pop of color, for the companion set to accompany you across all your intergalactic escapades.


When is the last day to get the cosmetic?


The last date to grab the free Star Wars Outlaws cosmetic is November 15, 2024. The promo started on August 15, which means you get three months in total to claim the item. It's a limited-time promo. So, if you meet all the criteria above, go and claim it before time runs out.


If you haven't ordered a copy of the game yet, check out all the special editions available for Star Wars Outlaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fit for an Alien Queen.
Toward the beginning of Perfect Organism: An Alien: Isolation Companion, author Andy Kelly asks a question that, to an outsider, might seem particularly pertinent: why write an entire book about one game? However, to those who have ever held a deep passion for a piece of pop culture, whether it be a film, a book, or a game, there’s an innate sense of understanding right from the start. After all, who hasn’t felt a burning desire to harp on about their favourite game for hours on end to anybody willing to sit down and listen? It’s only natural that when we love something so completely, we want to talk about it.
This, ultimately, is what makes Perfect Organism such a pleasant read; it could only have been written by someone who loves Alien: Isolation from top to toe. I’ve experienced far too many books based on the world of video games that felt like they were written out of some begrudging obligation, but Andy Kelly’s exploration of Creative Assembly’s outstanding survival horror is simply overflowing with love and enthusiasm. As somebody who holds a similar passion for the game and the Alien franchise as a whole, it resonated with me deeply.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Publisher The Arcade Crew and developer Assoupi have revealed a brand-new platformer called Mainframes. It's a refreshingly unique take on the genre in which you take on the role of Floppy who, in an effort to discover its true function, sets off on a quest of self-identity.
The cool thing with this one is that the levels are essentially built to look like a computer desktop, with the platforms being actual program windows that you can alter at will. You'll encounter cute characters on your journey and relax to some lighthearted music tracks that feel perfectly suited to the pixel art world.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Collecting trading cards, especially vintage cards, has gotten considerably dicier — seemingly overnight.
Over the past month, multiple people have come forward to demonstrate how various X-ray technologies can reliably see inside unopened trading card products. The concept of X-raying packs has been rumored for as long as X-rays and trading cards have existed at the same time, yet most believed the idea apocryphal, or at least impractical.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

Elrentaros Wanderings is a brand-new game from Rune Factory creator Yoshifumi Hashimoto and his studio, Hakama, which takes place across two parallel worlds: one in a present-day Japanese school, and one in a fantasy land where a small village is plagued by monsters that live in nearby dungeons.
Your character — male or female — must be the one to clear out these dungeons, making friends with the locals and upgrading weapons to take on progressively harder dungeons. But sometimes, when you go to sleep at night, you wake up in that parallel universe... and all the characters seem like the ones you just got to know in the village. How strange!

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

Today is their day. We have lined up these racing games on a starting grid and are interested to see how things shake out. Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets?

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serie A's bid to force Cloudflare to participate in Piracy Shield, Italy's pirate IPTV blocking system, has failed. The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

In God Of War Ragnarok, the action kicks off a during the apocalyptic fimbulwinter, which is probably bad for some characters I don’t care about, but it is good for me personally, because there’s a lot of snow to play with.
How much snow, you ask? 190 flippin’ gigs worth, apparently, according to Sony’s system requirements.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The continued rise of Japanese manga is accompanied by interesting facts, figures, and curiosities alike. Of all graphic novels sold in the U.S. during 2023, half were manga. Of those who consume manga digitally in Japan, the most prolific are the over 50s; half read manga every day. Estimates show that over 1,300 pirate sites offer manga and in a recent single month, 100 new pirate manga sites appeared online. Cost to the industry: $800m per month.

This type of blocking can be circumvented by switching to public DNS offered by companies including Cloudflare and Google. Tests carried on several ISPs in Malaysia this week reveal that requests to Cloudflare and Google public DNS servers are being hijacked and diverted to local ISP DNS servers.

Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

Have Sony's goons found me at last, after swearing vengeance for that 8/10 I handed God Of War 3 as a cub reporter? Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing?

With my last remaining un-fugged brain cells, I have wrenched this column back from its hiatus, and who better than to get us into the swing of things once more than Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer and bloody RPS legend Adam Smith!
