        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing Blue Lock has a knack for, it has to be unpredictability. Season 1 often left me guessing to the point where I just couldn't flat-out anticipate what would come next. And by the time I reached its finale, I was left wondering, "What's next for our boys in the big blue?"


Season 2's first episode captures that same essence of unpredictability in an entirely unique way, blending new and familiar faces alike. You'll know exactly who the key players are by the look 'em. Just spot the ones with vibrant hair colors or an updo that would make Goku proud, and you've got your main cast. Even though the name of the game remains the same, Blue Lock Season 2 Episode 1 kicks off with a bang, leading the way for a thrilling new arc.

As I just mentioned, the Amidst the Star quest comprises several individual quests of the same name. There are a total of six parts, and each one tasks with you a number of different objectives that must be completed to finish the entire questline. The first part can be started directly after you finish the main Black Shores storyline, and each part after that can be completed in any order. I recommend you do this in the given order, however, as there is no real reason not to, for clarity's sake.

That is, unless you seem to have forgotten a little something from the Echoes season pass before the swap.


While it may seem like you've simply lost the loot from the last season pass and need to move on, that isn't the case. Here's how to claim any Episode: Echoes season pass rewards you forgot to snag in Destiny 2.


How to get your missed Episode: Echoes season pass rewards in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid


To get your Episode: Echoes season pass rewards, you'll want to head to the official Destiny 2 Previous Season page. Here, you'll need to click on My Account in the top-right and click on the platform you mainly play on. Log in, and you'll be brought back to the same page. If there's an infinite loading circle, then you simply need to refresh the page, and it should fix itself. 


On this page, you'll find two tabs for your account alongside the character for which you're claiming rewards. All you need to do now is scroll through the pages, click on whatever items are shining, and then click Claim. From there, they should be added to your Destiny 2 account. Legendary weapons from Episode: Echoes will have question marks on them. This is normally how they hide future seasonal weapons, but the question marks tend to go away in the game. They don't on this page, but you'll still receive the same weapons you should've.


Any rewards that you don't claim by the end of Episode: Revenant will be gone for good, giving you a few months to hop on and snag whatever you missed. Once Episode: Revenant ends, it will become the new "Previous Season" for you to claim lost rewards from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Angelo Stiller RTTK SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can add a new promo card to your Ultimate Team squad.


Stiller is the latest entrant to the promo, and his special card is part of a challenge. This allows everyone to have the same chance of playing with the card. But should you unlock the card by investing your resources? Let's look at how you can unlock the new card and the cheapest solution to use. 


EA FC 25 Angelo Stiller RTTK SBC tasks


The Angelo Stiller RTTK SBC is a relatively beginner-friendly challenge. With just one task, you should be able to complete the challenge without having to buy any resources from the market. 


Task 1 - Angelo Stiller



Min. 1 Players from: Bundesliga


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84

While the new Stiller item is cheap to obtain, it has plenty of limitations. It doesn't have the best of playstyles, and just one Role+ at CDM. The card will need at least a couple of upgrades in the near future to become usable in the competitive modes. If you have to add a midfielder, the Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC is a far better alternative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the new features added to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Jungle Getaway update on October 9 is the ability to hold tools or hand accessories in Photo Mode, and it’s a great way to add some life to your shots. 


Whichever hand accessory you’ve got equipped when entering Photo Mode will be the one appearing in the shot. If you want to use a specific hand accessory, then you’ll need to select it through the Wardrobe Menu prior to entering Photo Mode. 


How to equip tools and hand accessories in Photo Mode


Screenshot by Destructoid


You cannot equip tools or hand accessories in the portrait mode of Photo Mode, but you can equip anything that you like in wider shots. To do so, enter Photo Mode and then press the button marked “Change Camera Mode.”

Then, in the menu at the bottom right of the screen, you can usually choose how you stand or whether you want to pose with your companion. Here, all of your tool icons will be displayed, and you can equip any of them. You’ll always stand in your idle stance, as you do when holding your tool outside of Photo Mode.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Umbrella icon is the one that allows you to hold your equipped accessory. To change your accessory, you’ll need to exit out of Photo Mode and instead open the Wardrobe Menu. Select ‘Accessory”, pick the one you want, and then go back into Photo Mode and follow the steps above to get your shot!


If you've ever purchased tool skins from the Premium Shop, they will also appear in Photo Mode, so now is a good time to show off your personalized style and get more use out of your hard-earned tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge 6 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can add one more free pack to your Ultimate Team inventory. 


Fodder challenges are my favorite – they're easy to complete, and you get new packs. Earning the packs is really easy, and the requirements for these challenges tend to be pretty cheap. Opening the packs during the time of promos also increases your chances of getting the special cards. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge without breaking the bank. 


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 6 SBC tasks


The RTTK Challenge 6 SBC has only one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 6 SBC



Max. Clubs in Squad: 4


Min. 5 Players from the same League


Max. 3 Players from the same Club


Min. 1 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 75


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 6 SBC solutions


The priority of this SBC is to solve with items that are already in your club. However, the requirement of 31 chemistry can be slightly tricky to meet. Here's a solution you can use to complete the challenge. 



Tietz ST 74


Pieringer ST 72


Majer CAM 78


Honsak CAM 70


Huseinbasic CDM 70


Maier CDM 76


Paredes LB 73


Jakic CB 75


Mainka CB 76


Maehle RB 78


Hoppe GK 67



You'll have to invest fodder worth around 4,500 coins to complete the SBC. The prices of some of these items can go up if multiple players bid for one or more of these cards to complete the challenge. 


After completing the SBC, you'll get an untradeable Prime Gold Players Pack for you to use in Ultimate Team. The pack contains 12 Gold Player items, and six of them are guaranteed to be Rare. One of the 12 items will be rated 82 or higher, and the pack is definitely worth more than the fodder you have to use. So make sure to complete the sixth RTTK challenge before it expires after the next two days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boundary of Deduction is a quest in Wuthering Waves that involves solving a puzzle with a solution that isn't so obvious. If you're struggling to figure out what you need to do, here's how you can get through it.


How to finish Boundary of Deduction in Wuthering Waves


Boundary of Deduction is located within one of the side rooms in the Error Cell of Tethys' Deep. To gain access to this quest, you must first finish the main Black Shores storyline first and foremost. Fortunately, the storyline isn't too long, so you can probably do so in one setting.


Once you have the Boundary of Deduction quest, you're tasked with making two nearly identical rooms the same by switching computers on and off. A portal in the area reveals that there are two rooms, and while both rooms appear the same (apart from the lighting) at the start, there is a key difference.


The computers on the table in the middle of both rooms can be toggled on and off, and you must match the red room's computers with the main room's. This is done by going up to one of the monitors present and interacting with them. This will change their state, letting you complete the questline.


Image by Destructoid


Remember that the rooms are mirrors of each other and appear as such when you look through the portal on either side. I recommend looking at the door in the back of both rooms as the door makes it easy to tell which side of the room you're on when turning computers on and off.


Image by Destructoid


When you've successfully mirrored the rooms, the quest will update, and you'll need to talk to the scientist outside the red room. The door in the red room will open up, allowing you to do so.

Speak with the NPC, and the quest will end, rewarding you with useful Asterite for your trouble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August, New Zealand's Justice Minister authorized Kim Dotcom's immediate arrest and extradition. Dotcom's response to his followers on X was simple: "I'm not leaving." Another post mid-September - "we are very close to disaster" - led to Dotcom disappearing for three weeks. On his return, Dotcom said X had suspended his account, based on an extremely serious allegation. After accusing Elon Musk of failing to help, yesterday Dotcom warned that a Trump loss would see Musk indicted and "fighting for his life." Dotcom has a plan to avoid extradition; chaos like this provides the fuel.

Good grief, first alarm clocks and now this... Rock band Green Day has announced that it is releasing 'Dookie Demastered', a collection of extraordinarily unique items that play individual tracks from the band's iconic 1994 album Dookie.
The items are available to purchase in the US, but only via a limited draw; so essentially you're free to order however many you like, but you could very well end up with none. Items include a floppy disk (Having a Blast), a doorbell (Longview), and a Big Mouth Billie Bass (Basket Case), but what really caught our attention is a genuine Game Boy cartridge that plays the entirety of Welcome to Paradise.

If you’d rather wake up immersed in sounds and music from your favorite Nintendo games, then Alarmo might just be the answer.


Alarmo is now available on the Nintendo Store for $99.99 USD, and requires Nintendo Switch Online in order to function as intended.


Alarmo, the weirdly innovative alarm clock from Nintendo, allows you to pick a scene from your favorite game. When it’s time for you to wake up and take on the day, sounds and music from that scene will play. Even before the alarm goes off, a character from that scene will appear on the clock face, waiting for you to open your eyes.

Speaking of the Way of Winter, you can claim a free cosmetic hat if you log into the game and turn your scenario reminder on. Here's how. 


How to claim your free cosmetic hat in Once Human


Screenshot by Destructoid


All you have to do is follow the prompts. Simply log into your Once Human account and go into any active character you currently own. If you don't have a character on an active server, you may be able to claim this hat from Eternaland. 


I have an active character in the Prismverse's Clash, so when I logged on a prompt appeared on my screen. Follow the prompt by hitting the Y key and then click the "Enable Sign-Up Reminder" button. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


And that's all you have to do for now. 


In case you don't get the prompt, you can also visit the Northern Tour event page (F3), click the sign-up button on the left side of your screen, and then enable the reminder from there.


Screenshot by Destructoid


And that's it, once The Way of Winter launches, you'll get this free hat — a cute, pink beanie — to keep your ears warm while we figure out how to make a campfire. 


Not that there's been any indication that we'll be able to craft campfires, but I'm sure we'll discover some way to keep ourselves warm in the snow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No snoozing on the job.
Nintendo has just done the most Nintendo thing imaginable and announced something that no one asked for while we're all waiting for something very specific that we're all asking for.
That said, Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo looks pretty darn cool; one of those things that we really didn't think we wanted, but are now absolutely itching to get our hands on. According to an Ask the Developer interview with the creative team at Nintendo, however, getting Alarmo to the finish line wasn't quite smooth sailing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would it be fair to say that we sometimes overlook SATA SSDs? With NVMe drives forming our future and mechanical hard disks increasingly consigned to the past, the 2.5in form factor is just kind of... there. In all of its middle groundedness.
Which is harsh, because they can provide heaps of capacity at relatively attainable prices, as the Crucial BX500 is currently demonstrating. Per Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon UK is running the 2TB version for just £92 (34% off) as well as 4TB for £178 (41% off). Meanwhile, Amazon US is lopping 43% off the 1GB model, bringing it down to $54, with the 4TB model shedding 13% to reach $210.

Now that Bungie's lifted all time-gates from episodic content, it's become clear how little of it there is.


Now, I complained early on in Episode 2's Act 1 about Bungie's annoying insistence on time-gating meaningful narrative development in Destiny 2. Imagine my surprise when Bungie announced that, starting with Episode 2 onwards, time-gates would be no more, allowing players to progress through Acts one at a time in their entirety. Exciting! Well, yes, but also no, because players are now surprised and unhappy with the fact that there's less than an hour's worth of story progress to be found in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RiME and GYLT developer Tequila Works announced on Tuesday layoffs have taken place at the company. It has also cancelled an unannounced game and will be "restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game." 


"These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio," said Tequila Works on LinkedIn. "This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide support and guidance to those affected."

Tequila Works already has a storied history in the indie scene since it arrived in 2009. RiME is one of its most acclaimed titles with an 80 Metacritic score. Its last project Song of Nunu was a collaborative project with the League of Legends license starring a boy and his yeti friend in an arctic landscape. 


In 2022, Tencent became a majority stakeholder in the Spanish studio. “We are delighted to ally with a partner that allows us to make Tequila Works a stronger studio with access to all the resources required to produce titles of the highest quality, all made with the care and passion our beloved fans know us for as well as the opportunity of bringing these projects to a wider audience," said Tequila Works Chairwoman Luz Sancho at the time in a news release.


Tencent also holds stakes in Epic Games, Bluehole, and Ubisoft. It also acquired Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock Studios in 2021.

A feat that, contrary to what many might think, is way easier to perform when compared to a fusion dance. Here's how to deflect Ki beams in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, as well as a great way to consistently avoid them while spending fewer resources. 


How to Deflect Beams in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


You can deflect beams in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero by activating Super Perception (O/B on Standard and △+O/Y+B on Classic). Activating the ability will cost two Skill bars and a meager amount of Ki, but that's hardly the most important thing about it, as the way you activate it will dictate how your character will deflect the blast.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

Amazon US, meanwhile, has it down from $230 to $130.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

Back in the summer of 2022, the world of Crayon Shin-chan collided with Millennium Kitchen's My Summer Vacation series in a delightful, beautiful game with an unnecessarily long name. Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey- brought Kay Ayabe's long-running game series into contact with the celebrated manga and anime property starring the precocious five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara, creating a crossover that felt so right that it's amazing it didn't happen sooner.
The upcoming sequel, Shin chan: Shiro and the Coal Town, is a stunning-looking game that builds on the first's foundations and takes the titular rascal into an imaginary world for this summer holiday. It launched in Japan in February and recently won an Excellence Award for Visual Arts at CEDEC 2024.

Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

While digging through the files of the recent 1.5.0 update, dataminer 'LuigiBlood' uncovered references to a Mario vs. Donkey Kong Festival Event — something that might appear a little late, but could just as easily tie in with the platformer's first anniversary in February 2025.

Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

Remember earlier this year when SEGA announced the strangely Fall Guys-esque free-to-play mobile game Sonic Rumble? Yeah, we do too (unfortunately), but today, we've learnt a little more about the game, making it appear somewhat more attractive: namely, there will be no gacha or pay-to-win mechanics (thanks, VGC).
That is according to Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka and the game's director Makoto Tase who, in a recent interview with Automaton, explained how the team opted against the mechanics due to how poorly received they tend to be in the West.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund's stakehold has reportedly decreased by over one percentage point, according to a Japanese filing. It now stands at 7.54% (thanks, GamesIndustryBiz).

We have highlighted the wonderful scanning work of @KeshiCorner a couple of times now on Nintendo Life. This is the retro enthusiast who managed to preserve classic Zelda and Mario rubber "Keshi" figurines through the magic of 3D scanning and now they are back with a new collection.
It's a 1993 range of Super Mario Bros. 2 figures that are stealing the spotlight this time, with five new designs featuring Birdo, Shy Guy, Ninji, Mouser and Wart. As was the case with Keshi Corner's previous collections, these figures would be a difficult find today, but their 3D scans are now available on the Internet Archive for home printing or more general preservation.

That’s a recipe for an SSD upgrade, and if it’s space you’re after, then Amazon Prime Big Deal Days has the 4TB Crucial P3 Plus on some big discounts.

For a brief moment yesterday, it appeared that Tomonobu Itagaki's game studio had been dissolved. But fear not, the Devil's Third creator still has his dev team, albeit under a slightly different name (thanks, Gematsu).
A company dissolution notice was published in Japan's government gazette yesterday, with the Gematsu translation reading as follows: "Dissolution Notice:  has been dissolved, so if you have any claims against our company, please submit your claims within two months from the day this notice is published".

If Thaddius Cornflakes had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

However, while somefans are complaining about certain changes made in the remake, the original game’s director is praising these tweaks online.

They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

He’s mental, he is! Has half a lemonade shandy with lunch sometimes, and wears one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo. Absolute mentalist! Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade.

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I type these words, specialist wifeguy assessor Brendy is rambling through the fog of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times.

I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks.

As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RIAA and MPA are concerned about a recent court ruling that could hinder their ability to combat online piracy using DMCA subpoenas. The court's decision suggests that IP addresses may not be considered "links", potentially limiting the scope of these subpoenas. This interpretation could impact the music and film industries' efforts to identify and take action against infringers and operators of piracy services.

It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on GitHub, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, Tom’s Hardware) as a controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time strategy game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.

The Court of Thessaloniki heard that the local man sold subscriptions to thousands of customers, generating millions of euros. After the court sent him to prison for eight years, attention now turns to a seized customer database. The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

I’m currently reading Brendan Keogh’s The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist. It’s interesting enough that I’m only mildly pissed off about the added academic book tax. Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price. Although, again, not quite funny enough to soothe my awful uni flashbacks of books that cost a week’s worth of groceries each.

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?
