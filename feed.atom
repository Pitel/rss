"I understand that the soundtrack is very much beloved, but ultimately I composed over nine hours worth of music and I'm still wondering how in the world we are going to fit all of that into a soundtrack."

What interested me, personally, was the demonstration of the platform’s version 5 update. It has been resting at version 4.5.9 since 2020. At its current version, it’s still a capable program that allows you to craft games for the Nintendo Entertainment System using modular code and a variety of tools that simplify the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been quite a few doubts about Bloober Team's ability to remake Silent Hill 2 in a way that keeps the spirit of the original while breathing new life into the legendary horror game. I've been guilty of perpetuating some of this cynicism myself, but there's a chance the game could actually turn out to be good.


A number of journalists have been treated to a preview of the Silent Hill 2 remake lately, and feedback suggests Bloober might actually have nailed it. With the release date just a few weeks away, early opinions seem to be positive. 




Eurogamer's Thomas Morgan says they're excited about what the full game will bring, praising the developer for daring to make a few changes. Jasmine Gould-Wilson, over on GamesRadar, said they went into the preview "cautiously," but was "pleasantly surprised," adding that they're "more than ready to give Silent Hill 2 Remake the chance it deserves," while the Metro refers to the game as "far better than we expected."


Silent no longer


From just these three opinions, it seems many of us may  be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Bloober Team has often been criticized for its mishandling of delicate subjects in its games, such as mental health. Given that the original Silent Hill 2 is wholly a psychological game, concerns were raised over whether the same studio that made The Medium could do one of the most influential survival horror games any justice.


Alongside these early indications of its potential, we've also been treated to a new story trailer. The teaser gives us a good look at some of the titular foggy town's inhabitants, including Eddie, Laura, Angela, and, of course, Maria.


With a modern control scheme not too far removed from the remake of Resident Evil 2, new puzzles, fresh visuals, and, above all, respect for the source material, we could be looking at one hell of a return for Silent Hill 2.

        <updated>2024-08-19T17:36:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gift Monday FUTTIES is now available in EA FC 24, and it's certainly a card with a strangely goofy name. 


This special 96-rated card can be obtained by completing the latest objective set in Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at the conditions associated with those tasks, and if you should unlock the card at all. 


EA FC 24 Gift Monday FUTTIES objective tasks


The Gift Monday FUTTIES objective has four separate tasks. Each task has certain conditions, and you can complete them in any order you like. Some of the tasks will finish quicker compared to the remaining ones. 



Spanish 6: Score 6 goals using players from Spain in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Crossing Guard: Assist 5 goals using Crosses with players from Liga F in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Gift Received: Score a Header goal in 2 separate matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Liga F Gift Set: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from Liga F in your starting 11.



The easiest way to get the card is by completing the tasks in Squad Battles. This is incredibly helpful if you can't field your best starting XI to complete the tasks. Moreover, you can also control the difficulty of the AI-opponents, making it easier to score goals and get the required number of wins. 


If you used Gift Links in FIFA 23, you'll know that this card is going to be equally fun to use. Is she going to be super-meta? No. But she has the correct playstyles required to survive in the current in-game meta. In fact, she could be really helpful to use if you plan on spamming crosses from the wings. Just boost her base Shooting and Dribbling and she should be good to go in the competitive modes.

Europa




My favorite demo I played had to be Europa. It is a gorgeous 3D exploration platformer akin to Journey, but instead of a desert, you explore a lush alien planet as a little robot boy. 


The whole feel of it is stunning and almost brought me to tears with its astounding music, art, and story. The demo left me wanting more and I am so ready to experience the rest. Europa doesn’t ha…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-08-19T17:23:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest update to Meme Sea added a cool new item called The Portal. If you've ever played Minecraft, The Portal will probably remind you of the famous Nether Portal but don't worry, you won't end up in the Nether if you use it. Here is how to get The Portal in Meme Sea.





How to get The Portal in Meme Sea


To get The Portal in Meme Sea you will need to defeat the Meme Beast boss. The Doge-resembling sea monster randomly spawns ou at sea, and you will get a notification popup when it does so. There's no way to specifically look for the Meme Beast but you will be notified once it spawns.


The Meme Beast has 1,000,000 HP so it's a pretty lengthy battle. But once defeated, the Meme Beast has a roughly 25% chance of dropping The Portal. This means that on average it will take 1-4 Meme Beast kills to get The Portal to drop, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't drop the first time you defeat it. However, once it does, you will never need to farm it again as it has infinite uses!


How to use The Portal in Meme Sea


In Meme Sea, The Portal is an item that allows you to instantaneously teleport to any other island you have found. By using the item, you will see a pop-up menu that allows you to choose which island to teleport to. This makes The Portal the absolute fastest travel method in all of Meme Sea, much faster than actually sailing between islands.


Even though it's not its main purpose, you can also equip The Portal as a weapon and hit enemies using your M1 attack. There are no special skills associated with The Portal, and there is no increased damage for using it, so it's more of just a funny little bonus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC is live in EA FC 24, and the Spanish attacker has received a new version in Ultimate Team.


As an SBC, all players have an equal opportunity to unlock this card. Inaki's FUTTIES version also features a 97-rated RM item with some really interesting stats. Let's take a look at how you can unlock this item, and if you should complete the new Inaki Williams SBC in the first place. 


EA FC 24 Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC is a beginner-friendly challenge in Ultimate Team. This card is quite easy to get as there's just one task. The required fodder can be ground out by completing the SBCs currently available in Ultimate Team. 


Task 1 - Inaki Williams



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 88



It's better to use a TOTS item to complete this task, as they can be found in different packs. You can either complete the 84x10 SBC or the 85x10 SBC to try your luck at getting a TOTS card. 


EA FC 24 Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solutions for completing the Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task 1 - Inaki Williams



Mapi Leon: 89


Irene Paredes: 88


Victor Osimhen: 88


Any 88-rated TOTS/TOTW item


Marie Katoto: 88


Jan Oblak: 88


Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87


Lina Magull: 87


Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87


Lea Schuller: 86



While I don't expect this Williams card to be a top-tier item in the current meta, there's an interesting part. The presence of the Aerial playstyle+ means you could use him to cross at the back post in attempts to score some headers. You'll need to boost his Shooting (93) and Passing (90) stats to use in competitive modes. Make sure to obtain the card with your surplus fodder, as it can be a nice super-sub in certain situations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

The PC release date announcement isn't all Square Enix revealed, either.  Along with the glorious news that PC players finally get to experience the action-driven RPG, there’s also a brand new trailer — ‘Deliverance’




Before Final Fantasy 16's September 17 PC debut, or September 18 for folks in Japan, you can play the demo right now on both Steam and Epic Games Store. The FF16 demo covers the opening section of the game, and save data carries over to your purchase of the full version. 


It's an exciting test that also includes Eikonic Challenge mode, offering both the chance to see if it's a Final Fantasy suitable to your tastes and also to check whether your rig can handle the minimum requirements, which are admittedly pretty hefty. 



Operating System: Windows® 10 / 11 64-bit
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / Intel® Core i5-8400
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700 / Intel® Arc A580 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070
DirectX: Version 12
Storage: 170 GB available space



If you want to secure your copy of Final Fantasy XVI right this second, it’s already available to pre-purchase through Steam and Epic Games, including the Complete Edition on both platforms. 


Final Fantasy XVI: Complete Edition comes not only with the base game, but also the DLCs released for PlayStation players — Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its thrilling new chapters, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga series has been taking things up a notch. Our favorite finger-eating sorcerer, Yuji Itadori, continues to tap more into his powers, all to gear up for the highly anticipated end battle. So, to keep up with everything, take a look at our Jujutsu Kaisen manga schedule.


Jujutsu Kaisen manga release schedule 


Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 267 will be released on Aug. 25, 2024. After this, the schedule is relatively up in the air, but the manga series has been confirmed to end on Sept. 30, with its last five chapters. That means JJK will conclude with 271 chapters, wrapping up the saga of the main protagonist, Yuji Itadori, and the Jujutsu Kaisen crew. 


Image via MAPPA 


Jujutsu Kaisen's manga chapters are generally released every Sunday. They launch around 8 a.m. PT/ 11 a.m. ET/ 12 a.m. JST on Manga Plus and Viz Media. We have seen some delays in its schedule, including Chapter 259 and Chapter 253. Given that there are only five chapters left, it doesn't look like there will be any more delays, but there may be a two-week gap somewhere in between. 


Even if the Jujutsu Kaisen manga is reaching its climax, we can still hold onto the anime. The show left off with the Shibuya Incident arc, which is about four arcs away from the manga.  We'll just have to see how long it will take for the anime to catch up to the manga, where it may leave us with another season and a potential movie finale.

Listen, this is very good news if you already have the PS1 tambourine controller, but felt that the official game for it was too difficult to understand in its native Japanese. I’m not saying this is a likely scenario, but in the off chance that you fall into this category, then this is the moment you’ve been waiting for.


Published in 2002, Mini-Moni: Shakatto Tambourine Da Pyon is a rhythm game based on the Japanese idol group of the same name. I hadn’t heard of them because I wasn’t listening to Japanese idol groups in my high school years, but it seems they had a pretty sizeable mark…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creds are one of the several currencies present in Madden NFL 25, and some can even confuse it with the standard coins you earn by playing the game.


Unlike coins, creds are marked as bright blue in color (although both have the same circular shape). This currency is also used very differently than coins, which makes it important to understand the best ways to earn and use it.


How to get creds in Madden NFL 25


The easiest way to get creds (might not be the most efficient) in Madden NFL 25 is to play the game. Every complete game will hand you a certain amount of this credit. While this process is time-consuming, it's easy, and there's no limit.


In the Superstar mode, you can earn creds during the Free Time phase by making a decision. Doing so nets you about 100 creds every time you choose Call Out or Prank War. You can also complete different objectives in MUT to get creds. Similarly, this credit can also be obtained by playing through the Franchise and Superstar mode (the rate definitely varies, based on your activities and how you're leveling up).

Best ways to use creds in Madden NFL 25


The blue creds are best used to unlock different customization items, and my favorite is the celebration bundles. You can unlock different celebrations once you've accumulated enough and then use them in Superstar mode.


There are additional animations that you can unlock as well. But unlocking celebrations seems to be the way to go. Unfortunately, this particular credit can't be used to unlock any packs in Ultimate Team. This would have been certainly beneficial, especially for those who don't purchase Madden points. Having the ability to open packs would have been better use of creds compared to unlocking new celebrations.

        <updated>2024-08-19T15:34:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The time has finally come for Jujutsu Kaisen fans, as the manga series marks its upcoming end in the following five chapters.


The creator of the beloved saga, Gege Akutami, officially confirmed JJK's conclusion during a Jump Press program. Akutami indicates they are working on the finale, with the manga set to end on Sept. 30, 2024. They also mention that the finale will "(probably) satisfy as many people as possible" to give the compelling narrative some justice.

Although the series had already been confirmed to end in 2024, it's surprising to see just how fast the manga will be on its way out. A lot has certainly changed since we first saw Yuji Itadori, the goofy yet strong main protagonist. The journey of these characters has been a part of our lives for years, and now, we'll finally know the end of his story amongst everyone else in the cast. Even more so, we'll discover what happens to one of the series' main antagonists, Sukuna, the King of Curses, who has frequently taken over Itadori's body.


The JJK manga began as a Weekly Shonen Jump on March 5, 2018. It has since gained traction, especially when its anime adaptation launched on Oct. 3, 2020. The demonic saga continues to take shape in both video game and movie form, stirring up the pot even more.


Even if the manga will be concluding, the anime still has quite a ways to go. Season 2 leaves off somewhere in Chapter 138, meaning it needs to catch up to Chapter 266 in the manga. Fortunately, Season 3 has already been confirmed, so that'll help fill the void when the manga ends.


But if you still need to prepare for Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending, check out the latest chapters of the series on Viz Media and Manga Plus. Just be sure to cram it all in before Sept. 30 to experience it in its entirety.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have amiibo support, and a list of compatible toys-to-life figures has been revealed. Some even include the Smash Bros. interpretations of the Zelda characters we know and love. 


Screenshot via Nintendo of America's YouTube channel


Every Echoes of Wisdom amiibo that works with the game


According to a translation of the game's official website spotted by Nintendo Life, the Echoes of Wisdom amiibo include the following:



Ganondorf (Tears of the Kingdom)


Zelda (Tears of the Kingdom)


Link (Tears of the Kingdom)


Zelda & Loftwing (Skyward Sword)


Link (Link's Awakening)


Young Link (Smash Bros)


Urbosa (Breath of the Wild)


Daruk (Breath of the Wild)


Mipha (Breath of the Wild)


Revali (Breath of the Wild)


Link (Skyward Sword)


Link (Twilight Princess)


Link (Majora's Mask)


Guardian (Breath of the Wild)


Zelda (Breath of the Wild)


Bokoblin (Breath of the Wild)


Link Rider (Breath of the Wild)


Link Bow (Breath of the Wild)


Zelda (Wind Waker)


Toon Link (Wind Waker)


Link (Ocarina of Time)


Link (The Legend of Zelda)


Wolf Link (Twilight Princess)


Ganondorf (Smash Bros)


Sheik (Smash Bros)


Toon Link (Smash Bros)


Zelda (Smash Bros)


Link (Smash Bros)



The unlocks from each amiibo will vary. They'll give Zelda different items, similar to how Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom work. Additionally, we'll also gain different colors of clothing for the princess. It would be cool to see a Wolf Zelda variant, but that seems just a dream. When you look at the list, it's quite astonishing how many Zelda-related amiibo figures have been released over the years.


There is no word yet on whether or not there will be amiibo specifically for Echoes of Wisdom. It seems unlikely, as we're just a month out from the game's launch as of the time of writing.

Setting the melodrama of a game wrapping up its post-launch support aside for a bit, Dead Cells is one of those ever-present indie sidescrollers that have been a mainstay for fans of the genre. Punchy and chunky in equal measure, this game has stood the test of time after its 2018 Early Access release ended up being a resounding success, and every big update has added something meaningful to the mix. The final The End is Near update is thus no different, outside of the context of it being the game's grand finale, that is.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If today's RPGs don't have enough airships for you, one developer hopes to rectify that in style. Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire wants to bring folks back to the "golden era of classic JRPGs," and we'll see how it fares the skies starting on October 10, 2024.


Publisher PQube and developer Octeto Studios announced the date along with the new trailer below. You can spot some real Skies of Arcadia vibes at first glance. When this one launches, it'll be plundering the skies on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. 




You might have already taken these wings for a spin yourself at this point. Sky Oceans had a demo during Steam Next Fest in June, offering up a brief taste of the life of a dogfighting sky pirate. The aerial battles themselves are turn-based, giving you the option to attack or evade enemy fire when necessary. If your crew's gear isn't cutting it, you can take some time outside of battle to reinforce equipment, boost your arsenal of weapons, and improve overall agility.


The story has you traversing the world above the clouds as Glenn Windwalker, who certainly has a name suited for adventure. The actions you and your squad take throughout the narrative can shape the future of communities around the world, each providing their own unique characters, dilemmas, and related sub-quests.


Whether or not Sky Oceans lives up to its inspirations is still, if you'll pardon the expression, up in the air. Personally, we don't have nearly enough sky-faring RPGs featuring rag-tag pirate crews, so the more the merrier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GOG has announced that their PC re-release of Capcom’s 1998 classic Resident Evil 2 will be available on August 27, 2024. I mean the original version of Resident Evil 2, not the 2019 remake. Of course. Just clarifying.


While Resident Evil 2 is often best remembered as a PS1 title, it was also released on other platforms, including Windows. Unfortunately, PC games from the era can be extremely finicky on modern platforms. There’s plenty of voodoo you can do to pull it off, but for those who don’t want to bother, GOG’s re-release will be pretty tempting. Rather than simply re-introduce the original Windows version back into the wilds, they’re going the extra mile to make sure it’s more comfortable on our futuristic super-computers.




The list of improvements shows items that are both necessary and hilarious. They include things like “Issue-less game exit” and “Improved game registry settings” among the audio fixes and improved subtitles. Then there are fewer must-haves like The 4th Survivor and The Tofu Survivor being available from the beginning.


The re-releases of the original versions of the first three Resident Evil games were announced this past June, along with the sudden appearance of the first title. 2 and 3 were left pending without a given release date, though you could buy the full trilogy in preparation. We’re still waiting to hear when we’ll see Resident Evil 3.


For my money, Resident Evil 2 is easily the best game in the series. While I have a strong fondness for the 2001 Resident Evil remake, I find that the infested police station is a much better setting than the Spencer Estate. The Resident Evil 2 remake is fantastic in its own right, but something gets lost when you remove the tank controls and fixed camera angles.


The PC re-release of Resident Evil 2 will be available on GOG on August 27, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living".
Kiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.
Kiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.

There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

This rock creates a circular zone of effect and any player’s character that comes close to the rock is immediately turned into a ragdoll, rendering them ineffective.


Since the Moai glove serves great defensive purpose and secures easy slap count, obtaining it is not as simple.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

How to find a Harmonic Camp in No Man’s Sky


To get started, players would first have to find a Harmonic Camp. These can be found by defeating Corrupted Sentinels, who are most likely present on a Corrupted Planet. Look for a Dissonant star system, as they are your best bet for finding a Corrupted Planet in No Man’s Sky. Once you find a Corrupted Planet and defeat some Corrupted Sentinels, you should be able to find an Echo Locator. You may also find an Echo Locator by destroying Dissonance Resonators which are present near Corrupted Sentinels.


Harmonic Interface puzzle in No Man’s Sky


Select Echo Locator in your inventory and interact with it so that the Echo Locator “resonates”. Doing so will reveal the location of a Harmonic camp. Head to its location and interact with a computer there which is called the Harmonic Interface.

To start the glyph puzzle, select “Scan memory registers”.


There will be three math puzzles for players to solve which are pretty easy. Just make sure you remember the answers you’ve given. They will come in handy for the next part of the puzzle.


Select “Access main interface” and choose “Input override glyphs”.


Now, you have to select glyphs with numbers that are the same as the results of the previous math questions.



That’s all there is to it. This will unlock the Sentinel Multitool and Jetpack, and players can find both items in the tent next to the Harmonic Interface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Freighters in No Man’s Sky are large space vessels that are capable of storing multiple starships and serve as a massive storage area for the wide array of resources that you run into and collect in No Man’s Sky. Moreover, Freighters make it possible for players to own Frigates and send them on missions. Frigates are larger than starships and are primarily designed for embarking on a variety of missions including exploration, combat, and trade.


Freighters in No Man’s Sky are also useful for building your squadron, which is essential if you’re interested in taking on fights in space, and do not want to bow down to rogue pirates. Your squadron consists of pilots you’ve met and recruited in your journey and they show up to your aid whenever you are under attack, providing decent backup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Whenever an update buffed or nerfed a weapon, I never took it too seriously because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable. However, the weeks following the Escalation of Freedom update's release have revealed a glaring issue with the game, and it stems from developer Arrowhead Game Studios. 


When the Escalation of Freedom update was initially released, it was met with a lot of backlash from players who were angry about the weapon nerfs it brought. In fact, it caused such an uproar that Arrowhead Game Studios quickly responded with a 60-day plan to update the title and alter its balancing to bring it more in line with what players are after.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloodborne's PC version is the most desired game in the world — right above Bloodborne simply running at 60 FPS on PlayStation. Not a week goes by on the Internet without us hearing about new rumors that Bloodborne is totally coming to finally grace PC gamers with its gory awesomeness. Sadly, it's not a reality yet, but rogue gaming science is getting us closer.


Not too long ago, hacker DwE revealed he'd been able to get Bloodborne to run on PC via the shadPS4 emulator, but he only had audio output. That might seem bad, but it was a sign that something could get out of it. Over a month later, we learned that DwE is finally getting to play Bloodborne, though the visuals are a bit different than what you'd expect:




The tweet above is in Portuguese, but the gist of it is easy to understand. DwE is using Linux and altered the game’s look to prevent the emulator from crashing. That’s why it looks less like the PC version of Bloodborne and more like it came out of Nintendo's Virtual Boy. 


I really like the black and red color palette. It really drives home the notion that this version is likely cursed and that you probably shouldn't play it, but I'm aware that it might not make for the most eye-pleasing experience if you plan to play the game for longer than 10 minutes at a time. 


An even newer video shows the game running without the color correction, but the sound and even a lot of the video are way too messed up for it to be enjoyable.




But if thought that a haunted version of Bloodborne on PC would be the only news we'd get about this project for a while, then I have good news. ShadPS4's Twitter account has just revealed a screenshot of the retail version of the game running on PC with the correct colors.




What does that mean?  I don't know, but I sure am eagerly waiting for whatever comes next.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes.

And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

After appearing to disregard the importance of security, shutting down now may have helped to avoid a larger bill, further down the road.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC.

Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both.

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets?

It's all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation.

I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia's Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve's third-person hero shooter Deadlock hasn't been officially revealed yet, but thousands of you unscrupulous devils have been playing it thanks to stolen development builds. Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top tier French football leagues, Ligue 1 McDonald's and Ligue 2 BKT, have obtained a new court order to block dozens of pirate IPTV platforms. As presented on the Paris Judicial Court's website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”
There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they have heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?

Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has repeatedly taken a tough stance on piracy, condemning freeloaders and calling for tough enforcement measures. In a recent earnings call, UFC parent company TKO noted that ESPN price hikes haven't made things easier. On the contrary, the company directly links price increases to the "jacked up" piracy numbers.

The project in question is Tramstertram. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it's a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the really rather lovely Viewfinder.

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’d initially assumed that puzzle game Sliding Hero counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don't have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you'll have to, I don't know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.
