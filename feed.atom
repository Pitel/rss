        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters," Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. "We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope each Hadouken doesn't cost me 99¢
Fighting games and phones might not seem like the most likely of allies, but the genre has thrived on the platform over the years with popular and expansive releases like Injustice 2, Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, and Skullgirls Mobile. The Street Fighter franchise is no stranger to the format, having released an excellent port of Street Fighter IV Champion Edition to iOS and Android several years ago. Next month, Ryu and company will return to mobile devices with Street Fighter: Duel, a free-to-play RPG that brings together 40 characters from the fighting game franchise in a new format that focuses on building teams of fighters.
So, you know, it sounds like most other mobile RPGs. And while the trailer below doesn't showcase any of Street Fighter: Duel's actual gameplay, if you go to its product page on the App Store or Google Play Store, you should see one screenshot that'll give you an idea of what it looks like in action. Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but I can almost see some inspiration from the wonderful Project X Zone games that have sadly been on ice since 2016.

Like with most other mobile RPGs you can download these days, Crunchyroll Games is promising PVP and a new story mode that'll no doubt find plenty of reasons to keep the same group of people constantly at odds with one another. If you're interested in Street Fighter: Duel, preregistration has opened on the App Store and Google Play Store. If anything, I'm sure this game will tide people over until the next "real" Street Fighter game launches this summer.
Here's to hoping it doesn't disappear in less than a year like Puzzle Fighter did. I'm still miffed about that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Highway to hell?
Given the critical and commercial success enjoyed by Life is Strange back in 2015, creating a compelling direct sequel can’t have been easy for developer Dontnod. Yet just three years later, players were surprised with a brand new story that was every bit as emotionally affecting as the first, if not more so. It boasts a plot that was both intimate yet grand in scope, taking two core protagonists on a road trip from hell after a tragedy tears them from their comfortable home life. In 2023, though, as the last main part of the Life is Strange puzzle to come to Switch, does the game still hold up? Well, yes… mostly.
Life is Strange 2 for the Switch contains all five episodes that were originally released over a staggered period of time back in 2019, as you would hope. Each episode will last you a couple of hours or so, so you’re looking at roughly 10-12 hours to complete the whole package, give or take. It uses that time pretty effectively, using the episodic structure to maintain a decent sense of pace throughout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2022 Game Awards, the team behind Dead Cells put out an animated teaser trailer announcing that the game’s next DLC expansion would be Castlevania-themed. It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content. Game Informer got the chance to speak with Evil Empire’s co-founder Benjamin Laulan and brand m…]]></summary>

This news comes from a Bloomberg report stating that the switch from Slipspace to Unreal will begin with a new game under the codename Tatanka, according to the publication's sources who are familiar with 343's plans. According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions. 


Bloomberg reports that future Halo games "will also explore using the Unreal Engine," but that some within the studio are skeptical of dropping Slipspace entirely in favor of Epic Gam…]]></summary>

As reported by NeoWin (thanks, Time Extension!) the project has been completed by GitHub user xander-haj with the assistance of 19 other contributors, reverse-engineering the SNES title to completion over an incredible 80,000 lines of code.

Live is currently available to beta testers worldwide after a limited beta launch last summer and a few delays, and we're expecting to see it sometime this year. And, in turn, it looks like The Pokémon Company will be winding down operations on the current app. While no official date for the app's removal has been revealed, The Pokémon Company states that "Additional information including exact timing will be shared soon via the Pokémon Support website".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.
Then there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s "words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc," and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

A cramped, old, smoky bar in a shopping mall deep beneath a Yokohama train station might not immediately appear conducive to game development, but things are starting to click in my head.

IllFonic is getting prepped to drop the first free expansion to Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the asymmetrical multi-player ghost-trapping game. Today's update fattens the game’s meat up with an extra stage, customization options, and a few quality-of-life improvements.
The biggest addition here is the new map, “The Facility.” Whenever I hear anything with that moniker, I always think of the classic Goldeneye map. There are no chemical tanks here, however, as the facility seemed to be set up for medical reasons, featuring all manner of sinister apparatus. Its haunted nature has proven to be something of a bugbear for the construction workers you’ll need to keep calm. The ghosts are keeping their renovations behind schedule, and when that happens, w…]]></summary>

One of the most popular collaborations to have come to Fortnite is recent months is Dragon Ball. Kicking off in August of last year, the event brought Son Goku and Vegeta amongst other characters to the Island and also added the since-vaulted Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud items. Those who missed out on the collab last time around will be pleased to know that the anime series is boarding the Battle Bus once again starting from today.
Alongside the return of the two aforementioned items and the series-themed 'Dragon Ball Adventure Island', the collab also brings with it new Weekly Quests and Rewards as well as the game debut of Son Gohan and Piccolo outfits. There are also new Dragon Ball emotes, which you can see a teaser of in the following tweet:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap has taken the world by storm, but one glaring omission fans have asked for is the ability to battle friends instead of only random strangers. As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I'd be a bit disappointed. It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

Developed by Navigator Games and published by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in association with Paramount Consumer Products, Avatar Generations is an RPG that lets players team up with iconic characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender to explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations. It features retold stories from the series and new ones adding to the overall world of Avatar. 
Check it out in the Avatar Generations launch trailer below: 


"In Avatar Generations, players assemble a team of iconic Avatar heroes and adversaries as they explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations," a press release reads. "The game's turn-based battles are immersive and strategic, with customizable formations and team combos. The journey not only revisits the most memorable moments from the Avatar universe but also offers new adventures in the Avatar world. Players will relive the classic adventure of Aang and his friends, while battling powerful enemies, upgrading heroes, and mastering the elements to bring balance to the spiritual and physical world."
Avatar Generations features Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Toph, and others like the Blue Spirit, Princess Yue, Kyoshi Warrior Suki, and more. Each character has their own skills and players can level them up to unlock more and customize them further. You can even equip supports like Momo and Appa to further strengthen your characters. 

Navigator Games will add new characters and companions, additional cosmetics and gear for heroes, and more areas to explore across the Four Nations map in future updates. 
Avatar Generations is out today on iOS and Android devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highly-anticipated ATLA mobile RPG is finally here
Avatar: The Last Airbender is widely considered to be one of the best animated series of all time, so it's not terribly surprising that it's getting another video game adaptation nearly twenty years after it premiered. Fans of the show are always clamoring for more content, so here's hoping that the new mobile action RPG Avatar Generations lives up to the hype. Created by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in collaboration with Navigation Games, the free-to-play title is now available on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.
As of now, the events of Avatar Generations will follow the adventures of Aang and company from the original series, but subsequent updates will touch on additional Avatar eras like The Rise of Kyoshi and The Legend of Korra. Players who start the game right now will get some welcome rewards, including Aang and Appa as characters to add to their squad. In classic RPG fashion, players will meet various characters from the show and be able to add them to their traveling party, including Katara, Sokka, Zuko, and Toph. Each character has their own set of abilities and special strengths as well, so you'll have some options in how you want to build your team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3wPu0sgfM
Along with the launch of the game, CDE also shared a new gameplay trailer, which shows off the game's turn-based combat and the adorable chibi art of the characters as they travel in the overworld across the Four Nations. While Avatar Generations is completely free to download, there will be some in-app purchases for "exclusive items, cosmetics, and more." I guess it wouldn't be a free-to-play game without microtransactions, right?
You can check out the official Avatar Generations website for any future updates about the game, as well as some events on the horizon. As a fan of the Avatar series, I'm excited to give this one a shot!

Well blimey, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is celebrating its 15th anniversary in Japan today! That's right, the third entry in what is one of the most iconic Nintendo franchises launched on 31st January 2008, and for many — even with how huge Melee was — this is what created some of the most iconic Smash things.
Final Smashes. Character introduction videos. Huge casts of fighters. Epic, sprawling musical scores and arrangements. Sonic. Snake. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was an event that capitalised on the success of its GameCube predecessor. It's one of the best-selling games on the Wii for a reason.

Then, in September, the ESA revealed that E3 2023 will take place from Tuesday, June 13, through Friday, June 16. 
Now, IGN reports it has learned that PlayStation, Xbox, and Sony will be skipping E3 2023, a major blow to what was supposed to be E3's big comeback. The publication also reports that these companies won't have a presence on the Los Angeles Convention Center showfloor, either, which is where game companies typically have large (and flashy) booths where people can preview games and learn more about what's in store. 
Despite this, Xbox is still set to have its own summer showcase in Los Angeles, like it has…]]></summary>

In a very fun, and very surprising piece of news, goofy window-washer PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab has revealed that it is collaborating with Square Enix on a special Final Fantasy VII DLC expansion, which will see our crew of dirt-blasters head out to the city Midgar for some deep-cleaning action.
The new "Midgar Special Pack" DLC will give PowerWash Simulator players the opportunity to clean up some familiar locales and enemies located around the miserable, smog-covered 'berg, giving the iconic Final Fantasy VII cityscape a sparkly sheen not seen since before the arrival of capitalist scumbags Shinra. Tifa's bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud's motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona' and the devastating "Guard Scorpion" robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.
https://twitter.com/sqex_ee/status/1620252315969265665?s=20&t=0shT7d5tDKcJW45Xt5YSZg
Unfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated "Final Fantasy VII Day". We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available. In the meantime, you can still go and spruce up Croft Manor for yer gurl Lara.
PowerWash Simulator is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Let's just check off what we already know for sure, shall we? In a couple of months' time, we know that Nintendo and Illumination will be releasing the Super Mario Bros. Movie via a slightly staggered launch worldwide. It's looking pretty slick and we can't wait to see it!

You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

Update : After the most recent Sports Story update, it seemed that the much-discussed 'secret dev room' had been removed from the game. We addressed this change in the original article below, but it seems that the room has not, in fact, been removed, merely changed.
Video evidence of this was posted to Twitter by @tend0g. Looking at the video below, you can see that the room has stayed very much the same, though the dialogue has changed to reflect the opposite state of development to that which we initially saw.

This week, the good folk over on our video team have been looking ahead to the year 2023 and getting down their predictions for what is to come. These thoughts ranged from the likely (more Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC) to the slightly less likely (a Part Time UFO sequel) and we have linked the full video at the bottom of this article for you to take a look at — because we're nice like that.
It was in the discussion on the more unlikely side of things that Felix suggested bringing Wii games to the Nintendo Switch Online library and using none other than the Switch Joy-Cons as a stand-in Wii Remote sensor (after all, the OG sensor was nothing more than two infra-red LEDs). Fortunately, @TuAmigoRoberto_ was on the case to test this theory on Twitter and you know what? It actually works!

Last week a video game miracle was performed with the release of GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo Switch and Xbox. As unbelievable as it is to relive this classic first-person shooter on modern platforms, not everyone is necessarily overjoyed.
Former Rare employee and GoldenEye 007 composer Graeme Norgate has recently shared his thoughts on social media about the state of the latest emulated releases, claiming the "old team" would not have let anyone down - adding how "labour of loves are always better value":

The curtains are open and the stage is set. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line marks the return of the Final Fantasy rhythm series to Nintendo consoles after a 10-year break. We've had a chance to go hands-on with an upcoming demo for the game, which will be available on 1st February, and if the early goings-on is anything to go on, then this sequel is shaping up to be as much of a delight as the 3DS entries.
In the demo, we were able to try out two modes — Series Quests, which is open from the start, and Music Stages, which you unlock after beating your first song in Series Quests. Music Stages is pretty much the exact same as it was in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call: once you've unlocked the song, you can play it anytime you want on any difficulty you want. The demo allows you to unlock 30 songs, 30 characters, and level up your collection of cute characters to level 30 — and you can carry over your progress to the full game.

Theatrhythm Final Fantasy quickly became one of my favorite Nintendo 3DS games when it hit the system in 2012, as did the Curtain Call sequel two years later. These weren’t perfect rhythm games, but they were unique and utilized one of the best compilations of video game scores in music history. The Final Fantasy series is special to me for many reasons, and perhaps chief among those is its music. That I ended up adoring the Theatrhythm series on 3DS was no surprise. I was surprised, though, to see publisher Square Enix and developer indieszero announce Theatrhythm Final Bar Line las…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Carpenter weighs in on EA's latest release on Twitter
Serving as the director and composer for over a dozen horror classics, including Halloween, The Thing, and The Fog, John Carpenter has secured his role as one of the greatest horror filmmakers of all time. Fans of his films might not know that Carpenter is also something of a gamer, having expressed an interest in the Fallout, Horizon, and Borderlands series.
Well, if you missed this detail in the past as I did, now we know that Carpenter is keeping up with the latest horror games, as he took to Twitter (with his aptly-chosen handle @TheHorrorMaster) yesterday to profess his love for EA's Dead Space remake -- more specifically, he called it a "great game!" exclamation point included. With so many games trying to imitate cinema, it's really cool to know a film legend who sees the legitimacy and artistic value in the interactive medium.
https://twitter.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1619855538589937665
In an interview with AV Club last year, Carpenter also let in on the fact that he wants to make a Dead Space movie. "I could do that," he said. Not only do I think you could do it, Mr. Carpenter, but I think you'd knock it out of the park. The cold confined indoor space of the Ishimura would be familiar territory for him, especially after helping to create The Thing's setting of an isolated Antarctic research site. I think we're due for another claustrophobic space horror flick, and this franchise would be a match made in heaven with Carpenter.
We're already in the middle of a flood of gaming adaptations, such as HBO's The Last of Us series, Amazon's upcoming Fallout series, and a Borderlands movie. Even amidst all these cool projects, I think John Carpenter's take on the Dead Space series would put them all to shame.

IGN reports that Nintendo, Sony, and Xbox will not have a presence on the E3 2023 show floor, nor will they be a part of E3 2023. This info comes from multiple knowledgeable sources the outlet has spoken with about the show.
While Sony has been skipping E3 for a while now and Xbox has recently held events offsite and adjacent to E3, this marks three big potential no-shows for the event this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even more hell to pay this fall
The animated, lively strategy RPG series Disgaea's latest entry is coming to the west this fall. NIS America announced today that Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is coming to PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and PS4 in the west this fall.
In this latest entry, the realm of Hinomoto has fallen under the control of a tyrannical force. Fuji, an "empathy-averse warrior gone astray," and his compatriots will have to band together and take it all back turn-by-turn, square-by-square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlk74apf2Q
A bunch of new features are in store for the latest Disgaea, including a special feature called "Jumbificiation." This apparently makes characters really, really big. I certainly hope that won't affect my nightmares at all.
Additionally, Item Reincarnation looks to add even more reason to grind and upgrade. The A.I. auto-battle function is also seeing an update, which should be great for all those times you don't want to issue commands yourself.
A demonic strategy
The Disgaea series has always offered a signature blend of stylized, cartoon-y devils and immense replayability. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless certainly looks to have more of both. The improved auto-battle options especially seem like a boon, given how much of my experience with Disgaea was grinding to make the numbers go up.
This newest Disgaea is already out in Japan, having released on January 26. But it looks like those in the west hopefully won't have to wait longer until this fall, and there are special editions on the NIS store for those who really want to celebrate a new entry. It will also have both English and Japanese audio available, for those who like the option.
Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless arrives on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch in the west this fall.

Remember that big old GeForce NOW leak from 2021? The one that supposedly revealed a list of in-development projects at various AAA studios? I've been thinking about that leak for just over a year now. More specifically, I've been thinking about one title on that list: a remake of Final Fantasy IX.
Recently, another, much less reputable rumor surfaced on 4chan (the thread has since been deleted, but its contents are cataloged on Reddit), suggesting that the Final Fantasy IX remake's announcement is imminent. I'm not sure whether or not I believe that rumor, but it got me pondering the prospect of this FFIX remake again. Do we need a remake of Final Fantasy IX at this point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supply has increased yet again
Since the PlayStation 5 launched over two years ago, it's felt nearly impossible to get your hands on. Websites would sell out in minutes after a restock, and it quickly became something of a status symbol to flaunt on social media, because either you were lucky enough to get one during a drop, or you had enough disposable income to buy one off a scalper. The shortage occurred for a few different reasons, the foremost of which was the strain that the pandemic placed on global supply chains.
After multiple promises that the console would be more readily available, it appears that the shortage has finally come to a close. In an official blog post, Sony Interactive's Vice President of Brand, Hardware, and Peripherals Isabella Tomatis thanked fans for their "patience as [Sony] navigated unprecedented demand for the PS5 console amid global challenges." She then said that anyone who was still looking to get their hands on a PS5 should have a "much easier time finding one at retailers globally."
[caption id="attachment_360393" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Even after promises that they'd ramp up production by the end of last year for the holidays, Sony still had a tough time keeping the console on shelves in 2022. Of course, they gave us similar assurances even before that. I was fine without a PS5 to call my own for the past few years, but now that there are some next-gen games on the horizon that I'm actually pumped for, I'm wanting to get on the bandwagon relatively soon. The ever-popular digital-only version of the PS5 (which is also $100 cheaper than the model that can take disks) is still sold out as of my writing this, but at least there are some options available for purchase right now for players who have patiently waited years for their console.

For about as long as I've been alive, Walt Disney World has been my family's go-to vacation destination. We've reliably visited the four-park resort in Florida every couple of years for around two decades. I have a real fondness for the parks. But I've always been a little unsure of EPCOT.
EPCOT, the "Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow" (named for an intentional community that Walt Disney thought up shortly before his death), is a weird beast. It's an edutainment park, which already makes it a harder sell than something like the Magic Kingdom.

The latest tease is part of the upcoming Star Path, which is themed around Disney's 100th anniversary, and will add a new animal companion to the game. Each Star Path has added a new animal companion, like the Halloween Wind-Up Raccoon, and the cute little Christmas fox, and this one is a fancy little silver bunny with a cute hat and a teeny-tiny tuxedo. Very sweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it's injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

As we enter a fairly exciting February gaming lineup, there's a few hidden things in there that keep popping up occasionally and reminding me that they exist: Theatrhythm Final Bar Line might be the biggest of those.
It doesn't seem like it's going to be a low-impact trailer dump either, as Square Enix has confirmed that "indieszero developers and producer Ichiro Hazama" will be part of the festivities. If you're a long-running fan of the series it should be a good time, hopefully filled with insights on the history of the rhythm franchise and Bar Line itself. With a multiplatform release (PS4/Switch), this could be the biggest Theatrhythm game yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sales slide by 76%.
The latest UK charts are in and, as expected, the top ten is headlined by EA's recently released Dead Space remake. Meanwhile, Fire Emblem Engage, last week's star performer, has tumbled down to seventh place after a 76% drop in sales for the week. Not unexpected, necessarily, but we'd hoped to see it continue its exceptionally strong debut. Regardless, seventh is nothing to turn our noses at!
Meanwhile, the only other new entry bar Dead Space is Square Enix's Forspoken, a game that has received decidedly mixed reception from critics and customers alike. The rest of the charts is made up of the usual suspects, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Pokémon Scarlet, so no surprises there. It'll be interesting, however, to see how long Pokémon manages to stay in the top ten.

It sure took its sweet-ass time getting year, but at least Deep Silver's death-development monster-masher Dead Island 2 is ensuring that it's gonna be gosh-darned sexy on arrival. Dambuster Studios has released several new trailers over the past month, introducing players to the four baseball-bat-swinging maniacs attempting to make a life for themselves against the backdrop of the zombie-ridden Los Angeles — or to use the Dead Island 2 vernacular: "HelL-A".
Each of the Dead Island 2 Slayers will be equipped with their own skills and abilities, as well as what I'm assuming will be a serious dose of Poochie-powered focus group cool. They'll be running, they'll be gunning, they'll be whippin', and boy howdy you can bet your ass they'll be quippin' — as our team of surviv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back to VHS tapes and cartridges
Don't Nod Montreal is teasing its next project. A new photo for the upcoming game has been shared on social media, alongside a call for job applicants.
As shared on Twitter, Don't Nod Montreal spotlights a screen of its new experience, with the caption, "Does it bring back childhood memories?" The team says it is hiring on this "new narrative game" and lists a link to the Don't Nod career site.
https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/1619009898712268800
The project will feature veterans from both Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2, as confirmed by its director Michel Koch. What it might be about is anyone's guess. Though from the décor and vibes alone, I feel like a '90s setting definitely lines up here.
What's in store for Don't Nod
The team at Don't Nod has been working on a few projects since the release of Life is Strange back in 2015. The Montreal subsidiary was established in 2020, with a stated goal of creating "even more ambitious" titles.
Between the follow-up Life is Strange 2 and other projects, like vampire RPG Vampyr and narrative one-offs Tell Me Why and Twin Mirror, Don't Nod has been busy. The company also changed its name, going from Dontnod to Don't Nod, and had a minority stake investment from Tencent.
Though Life is Strange is now under the wing of another studio, I'm curious to see what the Don't Nod crew are working on next. This image gives off some of the familiar hometown-story vibes that Life is Strange has been known for. But we probably won't know much more about it until Don't Nod Montreal is ready to fully reveal it.

If you thought that the marketing for The Super Mario Bros. Movie had already gone too far, then you ain't seen nothing yet. German frozen pizza company Pizzatainment has today announced that it will be collaborating with Nintendo on a range of 'Mario-themed' pizzas — though the theme seems to be limited to the colour of the boxes (thanks, RTL Today).
There are two different pizzas currently announced for the collaboration: 'Triple-Salami-Explosion' and 'Quattro Formaggi Deluxe'. If you're thinking to yourself "hmm, that doesn't sound like anything to do with Mario," then you would be correct. It isn't. What makes them 'Mario-themed' is the presence of Mario and co. on the boxes — hardly a prime advertisement for the franchise, but proof that Mario's face exists, we suppose.

“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision," but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slog to the Nether Regions.
Years in the making, Trek to Yomi is the vision of indie developer Leonard Menchiari, backed by Polish studio Flying Wild Hog and publisher Devolver Digital. Essentially a side-on slash 'em up, its hook is its spectacular aesthetic: feudal Japan and the samurai code recreated through cinematic camerawork in striking black and white. An homage to vintage Japanese films – most notably those of Akira Kurosawa – Trek to Yomi is a samurai story of revenge and redemption. It dives into the Shinto underworld of Yomi carrying some moral question marks to add a bit of intrigue.
The mood is set in an opening tutorial scene that sees protagonist Hiroki learning sword skills from his master. Suddenly, the master is called away on some serious business and Hiroki sets off in pursuit. What follows is a gorgeous, sweeping run of the camera through Hiroki’s village. Controlling in 3D, as you descend the towering steps from the dojo and follow the road directly down towards to bottom of the screen, the camera dollies backwards along the bustling main street of the village.

When Homeworld's Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "Modern" set
Coming off of a medium-sized bug fix update, Fallout 76 has something new to offer the community this week: a set of decorations.
Dubbed the "Modern Living Bundle," Prime Gaming subscribers can get a bonus set of items, which are primarily used for creating and maintaining C.A.M.Ps (player-made structures).
Here's what you get in the Fallout 76 Prime Gaming Modern Living Bundle:
Modern Home Rug
Modern Home Wallpaper
(5) Carry Weight Booster
(5) Repair Kit
If you're wondering how to claim them (and are a fairly new player), Bethesda has instructions: "The Modern Home Rug and Modern Home Wallpaper can be found in the C.A.M.P. menu and does cost some crafting materials to place inside your C.A.M.P Consumable items, including Repair Kits and Carry Weight Boosters, can be found on your Pip-Boy." It's available for all platforms as well (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S). You have until April 26 to redeem the offer: so if you still play Fallout 76, you may as well head here, click "OK" and come back to it eventually.
Can you believe that it's been over four years since this game launched? It's hard to come to terms with the fact that this didn't fizzle out entirely shortly after launch, but at the very least, the Fallout name is still kicking while Bethesda plans their next move. Hopefully it'll make a bigger splash than Fallout 4 did.

It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite's battle royale island with "Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super" on it this morning, alongside tomorrow's date. This means we'll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

January 30, 2023
As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn't make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here's hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There's also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

When SpongeBob SquarePants debuted in 1999, I had just said goodbye to Nicktoons and Nickelodeon as a whole. Arguably, I should have parted with that part of my childhood a few years earlier, but I was a late bloomer. Nevertheless, the misadventures of the little yellow sponge that lived in a pineapple under the sea would fly under my radar for several years. It wasn't until my final year of high school that I, bored at home one afternoon, decided to give the show a go during one of its many marathons.
I remember the first episode I saw. It was "Graveyard Shift," the episode where SpongeBob and Squidward have to work 24-hour shifts at the Krusty Krab. If you've seen it, you know the episode goes for kid-friendly horror and ends with an out-of-left-field cameo f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across the Spongeverse.
A few years ago, Purple Lamp Studios released SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, a solid revival of a 3D platforming classic from decades past. Sales for that remaster were evidently robust enough to justify development of an all-new sequel, as SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was announced a little over a year later. Built from the ground up for modern hardware, this new release carries on the spirit of the original while integrating many new ideas and designs of its own. Though The Cosmic Shake isn’t exactly a game that reinvents the 3D platforming wheel, it offers an enjoyable and delightful experience that no fan of this nostalgic genre will want to miss.
The Cosmic Shake picks up with SpongeBob and Patrick meeting a mysterious mermaid named Kassandra who offers them a bottle of mermaid tears for them to use as bubble soap. The tears have magical properties and legend has it that they have the ability to grant wishes, but things get out of hand when SpongeBob and Patrick overuse them and tear apart the multiverse. As a result of their mistake, Bikini Bottom has become drenched in cosmic jelly and overrun by strange jelly creatures, while all of SpongeBob and Patrick’s friends have been scattered across the various Wishworlds that opened portals all around town. The two thus set out to repair the damage and collect jelly for Kassandra, who totally doesn’t have ulterior motives.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…]]></summary>

The subscription streaming service revealed this news today with a new image and a poster for the upcoming pirate series based on the long-running (and extremely popular) manga and anime series, One Piece. The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix's One Piece logo in the image below as well:

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar's Sanji, Emily Rudd's Nami, Godoy's Luffy, Jacob Gibson's Usopp, and Mackenyu's Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew's ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 
While waiting for more, read Game Informer's review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔

January 29, 2023
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

Capcom has today released its latest financial report for the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2023. In it, the publisher states that it expects to reach a record 40 million in unit sales by the end of the period, driven in large part by the Monster Hunter and Resident Evil franchises.
The forecast comes after the publisher confirmed it has sold an incredible 29.1 million units during the fiscal year so far, up from 25.8 million the year prior. This is primarily due to the growth of catalog titles, including the remarkably successful launch of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which recently surpassed 5 million units sold.

This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow "?" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. 
For more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach.

I've been thinking a lot about Pokémon Mystery Dungeon recently. Maybe it's the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it's the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question "What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?" my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.
Either way, that's the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn't very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.

The news was shared via the @FinalFantasy Twitter account and the stream is set to take place on the official Square Enix Twitch channel a little later on. What exactly the livestream will entail is still something of a mystery, though we do know that it will feature content from developers at indieszero as well as words from one of the producers, Ichiro Hazama.

The entertainment world is in mourning after hearing the sad news that Annie Wersching, who portrayed the much-loved character of Tess in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, passed away on Sunday, January 29. She was 45.
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977 and pursued the dramatic arts at an early age, training as an Irish stepdancer throughout her schooling before transitioning to the world of the theater during her college years, eventually earning a BFA in Musical Theater in 1999. Wersching's on-screen debut came about in 2002, with an appearance in Star Trek: Enterprise, which would lead to a steady stream of television work, including bit roles in shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Birds of Prey, Frasier, Killer Instinct, Boston Legal, Castle, Runaways,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there's no word on who's attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to "build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film." This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics' game is already in production, so we'll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No sign of the DK Rap, unfortunately
This weekend saw the production company Illumination release a short teaser for its fun-looking Super Mario Bros. Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming's most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan's performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.
The clip rolls out with footage we've seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin' ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario's solemn "Meow" fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.
https://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1619795800686739456?s=20&t=fwHS1JERA9tBi1kQ8j3riw
I'd love to think that the "Meow" line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan's snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. And, you know what? it's really not looking too bad.

The retro-inspired shooter genre is really in high gear. Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.
Dread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cutesy platforming legend returns on PS4 and Nintendo Switch
A real Taito gem has been added to the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster has re-released the veteran arcade developers' ultra-cute, ultra-challenging platform actioner The NewZealand Story, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1988, before swiftly being ported to a wide variety of home computer and console platforms. The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized "NewZealand", determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.
You can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdyRIX4q0MY&ab_channel=Shadowserg
What follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It's a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.
The NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito's '80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming's most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.
The NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

The past few years have been rife with some awesome remakes or remasters of some of the best classic games out there, including but not limited to titles like Bioshock, Final Fantasy VII, Dead Space, The Last of Us Part I, and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. While this trend is only heating up with seemingly more and more remakes/remasters released and announced every year, I'm starting to think about what other classic games I'd like to see get a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.
This is a bit of a tricky one for me because I didn't game as much when I was younger — unless Disney Interactive Studios is willing to revive the 2007 PS2 banger that was High School Musical: Sing It! That's not to say there aren't some classic games that are nostalgic for me,…]]></summary>

A change of the seasons is usually a time for celebration. Whether you’re going from the dead cold of winter to the crisp dew of spring or leaving behind the dog days of summer for the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, the dawn of a coming season can bring with it fresh perspective and rejuvenation. At least, that’s what the changing of seasons is in our world. In SEASON: A letter to the future, seasons don’t necessarily abide by the calendar. People can’t assume they know when a season is going to end, but when it does, far more than just the temperature will change.

I sort of stumbled out of the starting blocks, as did much of the wider world, and here's to hoping the remainder of the year goes a little more smoothly. I hope that the year has started well for all of you, regardless.
And, as we enter the final weekend of January, I'm very happy to see you show out for our weekly get-together.

And while for many this is something to celebrate, these new ports aren’t quite as good as they could have been.

After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO's The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. 
Check out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: 
The journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d
January 27, 2023
As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO’s take on Naughty Dog’s shroomocalyptic game series The Last Of Us has been praised by critics as the best video game adaptation ever, but the show’s co-creator doesn’t think both games can be squeezed into a single season each. Craig Mazin discussed his hopes for the TV version of The Last Of Us while guesting on an upcoming episode of The Playlist Podcast. Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

The post-apocalyptic survival MMO was delayed from March to November this week as it turned out the devs hadn't actually got the game trademarked, prompting accusations from within the game’s Discord and Reddit communities that it might not exist at all. Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

Cook Serve Forever looks more ambitious again. It's a new game from the same developers with similar combo-tapping food prep at its core, but set in a new solarpunk city. As of today, there's a demo you can play and an early access release date set for April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of "What the hell is this?", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: "Wooooaaaah."
Consider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory.

Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So those Tango Gameworks leaks turned out to be true. After repeatedly stating that this evening's Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It's a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there's an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it's out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today's Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry "a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series." For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Xbox and Bethesda's Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It's directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang's latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.]]></summary>

In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I'm the dad now, and the "full remake" Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
"Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007," a press release reads. "Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you'll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone."

Microsoft released its second quarter financial results for the 2023 fiscal year yesterday, and it revealed that Xbox gaming revenue declined 13% overall. Xbox content and services, such as first-party software and monetization in third-party games, declined 12%, but Microsoft notes that this decline is up against a "strong prior year comparable." Given that Xbox's 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn't surprising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland's resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will "keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life."

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe "who was in a dating relationship with the defendant." 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland's attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year's High On Life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there's been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix's newfound PC love-in would mean I'd be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn't, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that's okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII's Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games. In terms of who owns the rights to the games, it’s these three companies.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the Independent Games Festival awards are the Oscars of video gaming, then that surely makes Rock Paper Shotgun's yearly Advent Calendar the BAFTAs. I'm justifying this spurious comparison because the games we picked as our favourites of 2022 have proven a strong indicator of what you'll find on this year's list of IGF finalists. Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today's example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That's an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it's such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could "live the book". Don't bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we'd be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they're achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn't want to live in any of the books he's been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn't want to be in them because you'd only end up being a side character, and that's boring.

        <updated>2023-01-24T14:31:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, The Last of Us' premiere scored HBO's second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, "Infected," has broken another HBO record.
"Infected" brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week's 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network's history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the "largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network," which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mahokenshi-review"/>
        <updated>2023-01-24T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. 
It's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.

I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn't an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It's a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…]]></summary>

The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that "Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy."

Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She's also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company's ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: 
pic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59
January 21, 2023
It's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it's been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it's clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward's tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if "no HUD" is any indication, it'll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting.

Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.
