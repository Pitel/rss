What’s weirder is that I’ve found it thoroughly enjoyable, and I don’t even have a no-good, pig-stealing, great-great grandfather who cursed my life to get me here. 


Yes, that’s a reference to Louis Sachar’s Holes, because the book has been freshly brought to mind in light of A Game About Digging a Hole, which lets you live out your childhood inner demon's deepest desire, and absolutely destroy the back garden of a house while looking for treasure.


Since this bizarre little game was released on February 7, I’ve been channeling my inner Stanley Yelnats and getting to grips with the mechanics involved in digging a hole. The process is a lot more complicated th…]]></summary>

With the Lunar Remastered Collection just over two months away, RPG fans will be able to get their hands on two beloved turn-based adventures from the Sega Saturn and PlayStation era. Today, ahead of the game's release, publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has shared some details about the game regarding the North American release.
In a fleshed-out FAQ section on the official website, GungHo reconfirms that the game will be launching both physically and digitally, exclusively on Amazon in North America. Store pages are even up. However, you won't be able to pre-order the game ahead of its release, and instead, you'll have to buy it on release day.

Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

Increasing this Drowsy Power (and cultivating good sleeping habits) is definitely worth it, because the higher the power, the more Pokémon will be drawn in for you to capture and befriend, including some rare ones with potentially new Sleep Styles.

Fantasy is about losing yourself in a world that doesn't play by the same dull rules as ours. By adding a layer of sound to the reading experience, a fantasy audiobook can turn the people and places we're reading about into breathing, moving pictures that play out in the mind like a film beamed onto a diamond screen.

Looking back on 2011's Fortune Street (or 'Boom Street' for those in Europe) today feels like a fever dream. A Wii board game starring Mario & co. that isn't Mario Party? One that's published by Nintendo but developed by Square Enix? And also features a handful of familiar faces from the Dragon Quest series? Sounds like something you'd find in a nasty AI-generated mash-up, no?
Fortunately (heh), Fortune Street was anything but. Sure, the crossover never quite reached the heights of the Mario Party series, but the bonkers board game has still managed to build up quite the following in the years since — even grabbing the attention of some rather talented modders.

No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're an EVE Online fan and you're excited about CCP Games' EVE Frontier, we have some great news.


To show some love during Valentine's Week, CCP Games will offer a free trial for everyone to check out gameplay and enjoy early access during the Closed Alpha state. This trial, as you might have already guessed, will be open to all, albeit with a few requirements.


EVE Frontier free trial dates


The free trial period will be available for all starting February 14 and will be open until February 24. During this phase, you'll be able to log into the game for free to tackle the available content and fully enjoy the core fundamentals.


The upcoming project is designed to be a Space Survival MMO that the players will shape (sounds familiar, doesn't it?) To survive, you'll have to explore and exploit every bit of the deep, dark space, but there will be plenty of challenges. As per CCP Games, a Rogue AI will challenge your survival and try to corrupt everything it touches.


How to participate in EVE Frontier's free 10-day trial




You can register for the trial using the official game website. You'll find the option to register for the trial on the left-hand side of your screen. Participation is completely free of cost, but you'll need to have an account.


If you already have an account, just log in. Alternatively, you can create a new account using a working email and password. Once you have created and verified your account, you'll be able to gain access to the limited-time free trial.


To download the game, you'll first need to download the launcher. The launcher is available for both MacOS and Windows, so select your platform. The remaining steps can be completed from the launcher itself. Additionally, there are three different editions available for players if they wish to complete the full purchase after enjoying the trial.

He Is Coming, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike RPG. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

Luminary publisher Rockstar Games' current project faces off against insider information, data miners, hackers, leaked documents, and more. And while a few of these leaks were a splash in the pond, others caused a tsunami of press coverage and speculation. Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two Interactive were left with egg on their faces multiple times.


Each of those incidents is chronicled in the timeline below with details regarding how the leaks transpired, and the fallout they caused.

According to True Trophies (thanks Push Square), the company has removed a whole bunch of titles from the PSN store, mostly from developer RandomSpin Games. This comes after an extensive investigation from IGN, numerous complaints from developers, and our own coverage on the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A diehard Civilization fan took it upon himself to fix some of the game's biggest issues before the masses even got the chance to complain about them.


Though Civilization 7 will only release on Tuesday, those with early access say it's great, though it lacks many simple but essential quality-of-life elements present in the series' previous entries. These mostly amount to inexplicable features and UI omissions that Firaxis has already stated plans to fix based on player feedback. 


That's cool, but, as noted by Polygon, a lone soul has beaten them to it.


Sukritact has been playing Civilization 7 since the beginning of early access and has just launched Simple UI Adjustments, a mod that aims to fix some of the more pressing matters. In short, the mod adds basic information tooltips for when players hover over tiles, with smaller icons for undeveloped tiles. You can also access diplomacy options by clicking on the city banners of other civilizations.


Since Civilization 7 isn't officially out yet, you can't comfortably download the mod via the Steam Workshop yet. You can, however, head here, download the mod, and put it in your mods folder, which should be here: *username*\AppData\Local\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier’s Civilization VII\Mods.

The adjustments might strike people who don't know the series as minor changes, but they carry a lot of weight when it comes to the enjoyment of the game, as they save players the trouble of digging for information in other menus.


Though certain features of Civilization 7 will be sure to disappoint some fans by launch, chances are the continued efforts of Firaxis and the mod community will have them fixed in no time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you know it from the 1987 Atari ST original or ports like the 1990 Game Boy version, Bubble Ghost is BACK, baby! The aptly-titled Bubble Ghost Remake gives the puzzle-adventure a fresh look, and it's set to launch on Switch and PC on March 27.


The concept of Bubble Ghost—which French developer Christophe Andréani created nearly 40 years ago—is right there in the title. As the titular ghost, players are tasked with guiding a bubble through an increasingly complex and treacherous mansion with nothing but the power of their breath. If you believe in both ghosts and bubbles, you can see how developer Nakama Game Studio's new take on the classic looks in action below. 




In addition to a global release on PC (via Steam) and Switch, Bubble Ghost Remake will get a physical release in North America and Europe. The standard edition will be available in both regions, while Europe will get an exclusive Collector's Edition through "European specialist retailers." 


Pictured below, the Collector's Edition packs the Switch version of the game in an oversized box with a bunch of physical extras. There's a CD of the soundtrack by Fran Romguer, a handful of stickers, an acrylic standee, and a prequel comic the dev team put together.

The updated version of Bubble Ghost features Story, Arcade, Challenge, and Speedrun modes. There are three difficulty levels, and alternate endings offer some replay incentive. 


All Bubble Ghost Remake really needs to succeed is some variation on the incredibly catchy music Hitoshi Sakimoto (Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII) composed for the Game Boy version. Now those are some bubble-blowin' jams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently discussed GTA 6 and seemingly teased that a GTA 6 PC port is in the cards.


The video game landscape has changed significantly in the years since GTA 5 released. Even back then, people were already riled up that the game didn't launch on PC alongside PS3 and Xbox 360 — yes, those were the consoles GTA 5 was made for. In an interview with IGN, Take-Two's big boss talked about the big elephant in the room, Rockstar's plans to make GTA 6 for PC a reality.


Zelnick has mentioned how Rockstar has never gone for simultaneous releases. "Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”


And PC was never included in the initial release. Still, Aside from Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis, every other big Rockstar title eventually made it into the PC — yes, even the original Red Dead Redemption — 14 long years later.


On top of coming to the PC, Zelnick mentioned how GTA 6 will likely also release on the upcoming console generation.


"We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that trend continue," he said. "Of course, there will be a new console generation".


GTA 6 is expected to make over $3 billion in its first year of sale, which is even higher than GTA 5's already spectacular numbers. At this point, it's less of a matter of "if", and more a matter of "when", since there's no way Take-Two would miss out on the huge and still booming PC Gaming market. Until then, we'll check out GTA 6 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S when it releases sometime during Fall of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it wasn't just you. If you tried to play any Roblox games in the past hour or so, like Blue Lock Rivals or Jujutsu Infinite, you may have failed to connect or even received an error when trying to do so. According to the official Roblox Service Status, this was due to an unexpected service disruption. Parents, rest easy! Not all hope is lost.


Is Roblox down?


No, Roblox does not appear to be down. Even though the Roblox servers went down at around 6:20 pm EST on February 10, 2025, they came back online roughly 45 minutes later at around 7:05 pm EST. Officially, Roblox confirmed that as of 7:04 pm EST the Roblox service had been restored and they would continue to monitor to ensure stability. We tried connecting to four different games just now without issue.





Did Roblox go down on February 10?


Yes, the Roblox servers suffered a service disruption on the evening of February 10, 2025. According to Roblox, the team was alerted to an issue preventing players and users from using the platform at around 6:22 pm EST. About 15 minutes later, they identified the issue and began resolving it to restabilize the servers. Then again about 30 minutes later, the servers were fixed and access was restored.


If your kids suddenly stopped complaining, then that's why. The young ones should no longer have issues connecting to Roblox. 


As for now, it appears that all three components on Roblox (User, Player, and Creator) across all platforms are currently operational and the servers are live and without issues. As such, you should be able to connect to Roblox without any errors.

He wants you to pain the bull of Landowner Olbram from the neighboring town of Zhelejov. But should you pain the bull or rat out Prochek for the Mice quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?


Should you paint the bull for the Mice quest or rat out Prochek and do the Frogs quest?


While both quests will progress this quest chain to the Battle of the Frogs and Mice side quest, I recommend ratting out Prochek over painting the bull. Doing so will fail the Mice quest, but give you access to a new quest called Frogs, which actually has better quest rewards. Here are all the completion possibilities and rewards for both the Mice and Frogs quests:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those who purchase the Avowed Premium Edition get the exclusive chance to experience it five days early. If you're here, you're probably wondering about the exact time it will drop, and we're here to show you what to expect.


Avowed Early Access Release Time, explained


According to the Xbox app, Avowed Early Access begins on Feb. 13, 2025, at 10 a.m. PST/1 p.m. EST/6 p.m. GMT. It'll be available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as long you already bought the Premium Edition. If you plan on playing the game solely through the Xbox Game Pass, you'll need to wait until Feb. 18 for Avowed's full launch date.


Game Pass users can still partake in Early Access when buying the Premium Upgrade Edition for $29.99. Not only does the pack include five-day Early Access, but it also offers two Premium Skin Packs for each of your companions. Use the skin packs to deck out characters like Kai, Marius, Yatzli, and Giatta. You can also check out the Avowed Digital Artbook and the original soundtrack to experience the game in its entirety.

Once Avowed Early Access commences, you'll embark on a journey to the Living Lands, a breathtaking realm tainted by a devastating plague. It's your mission to unearth the roots of this darkness using the game's innovative combat system. Unlike many RPGs that confine you to a single class, this game empowers you to wield a diverse range of powers. You can brandish a traditional sword in one hand while the other wields a magical grimoire or experiment with a variety of other weapons.


Having had the privilege of a sneak peek during my Avowed preview, I can attest that it's a spectacle to behold. The sheer number of possibilities in both your defense and offense strategies is unlike anything I've seen before. So, if you're eager to experience it for yourself, get ready for its Early Access launch this week.

Since you'll be doing some thieving, you'll need to look the part with a specific outfit. Here's where to find Thieves Clothing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.


Where to find Thieves Clothing in KCD2 Materia Prima quest


When you arrive at the quest waypoint of the Thieves Clothing, you must speak to the bathhouse owner, Dorothy. She'll tell you that the outfit costs 199 Groschen to purchase, which is a pretty hefty price during the game's early stages. Fortunately, there's a way to get it for free if you sneak your way to the chest holding it. Get a lockpick if you don't have one already, and wait until nighttime to put it to use.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 bombards you with a wealth of information during its tutorial, a few features still fly under the radar. A perfect example is the enemy’s health bar — a seemingly basic mechanic you'd expect to be front and center, yet it’s actually cleverly concealed.


I didn't even know that such a thing existed until Reddit user AdministrativeGain77 pointed it out. You'll see it just beside Henry's health, displayed as a purple bar during combat (the same place you see your horse's stamina). In all my 25+ hours, I thought it was my armor health or something to do with stamina. But now that I've seen it in action in my own playthrough, I can't believe it took me so long to put two to two together.

Of course, certain victory conditions are more straightforward to achieve, but they might not be the best route for you to take.

If you don't like to take a direct approach, going for a Domination or Points Victory might be far more suitable.

There are four Legacy Path Victories, which are divided into Culture, Economics, Military, and Science. First, let's examine how to achieve these four victory conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Croix Bethune Future Stars SBC is now available in EA FC 25, and you can complete it to obtain a special card.


To obtain the item, you'll have to complete all the SBC tasks before they expire from the Ultimate Team. To do so, you'll have to submit different squads according to certain requirements. Let's take a look at how to complete the SBC and if it's worth completing at all.


EA FC 25 Croix Bethune Future Stars SBC tasks


The Croix Bethune Future Stars SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements.


Task 1 - United States



Min. 1 Players from: United States


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Croix Bethune Future Stars SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest Future Stars challenge in Ultimate Team.


Task 1 - United States



Sanchez 83


Dumornay 83


Palmer 85


Dovbyk 84


Palacios 84


Bennacer 83


Dimarco 84


Neves 84


Mane 84


Orban 83


Casemiro 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Sanchez 83


Dumornay 83


Any 85-rated TOTW item


Dovbyk 84


Palacios 84


Bennacer 83


Dimarco 84


Neves 84


Mane 84


Orban 83


Casemiro 84



The SBC offers two special items: one with the Incisive Pass+ (CAM) and the other with Power Shot+ (ST). While both cards are average at best, I like the CAM item a lot more. Its stat distribution is superior to that of the ST item, and it has more playstyles. This certainly makes the CAM item a good bargain choice for beginners.


If you want to spend more fodder and obtain top-tier meta items, both the Fernando Torres and Andrea Pirlo Future Stars Icons are great choices. These SBCs cost significantly more in terms of fodder costs, but the cards you get are far more useable in the meta. They're well-suited for players who have a fair few amount of fodder in their clubs.

Translated via Google, Hino prefaced the screenshot drop by stating that major information reveals for the game have been slightly delayed by issues with "compatible models and new hardware" (what could he possibly be referring to there, eh?), but the visuals and content have developed to make the upcoming title "one of the best RPGs out there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

If you, like us, have been eagerly waiting for new information on Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate, then you're just going to have to be patient and wait a bit longer.
However, given that next to nothing has been shared regarding the game since its initial teaser trailer in 2021, it's understandable if you're feeling somewhat anxious about its development. Thankfully, in a new livestream (thanks, Automaton), creator Yuji Horii has stated that the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest XII".

We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

If you'd have told us five years ago that Batman: Arkham Knight would make its way to the Nintendo Switch, we would have laughed in your face and waddled off back to the Iceberg Lounge.
Alas, alongside its predecessors, Arkham Knight arrived on Switch in December 2023, and though it wasn't particularly very good in terms of performance (in fact, we'd say it was incredibly poor), it was nevertheless a surprising addition to the Switch library of games.

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels are "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game", according to a report by Bloomberg. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water.

It’s always a bit disappointing that they don’t do the same when the leak’s coming from inside the house. Such is the case for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, after Sony seemingly accidentally…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not the destination, they say, it's the pickled eggs we slurped along the way. In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here's a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

As noticed by third-party tracking platform SteamDB, Valve have begun adding warnings to early access info boxes, making it harder to accidentally spend your pocket money on a promising project that hasn't advanced in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vendrán Las Aves - "The Birds Will Come" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

Ah well!

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry's Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called Grab Them By The Eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ye to the walls, pikefolk of PC gaming. We've had a languid and fattening winter with a quiet game arriving here and there to peddle its wares. But the calm times are coming to an end. The big releases now march towards us in droves. But they do not know what lies waiting for them in the moat.

The battle is yet to start, but we will upturn the chumbucket of news into the water below. Feed it, for heavens sake. FEED THE MAW!

While VPNs also face blocking, the task isn't always straightforward. The data shows that sales sites in Russia prefer to expose IP addresses owned by foreign companies, located outside Russia.

If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA's export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

The government considers a 'viewing ban' for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cherish my fairly sharp memories of the 2016 launch version of No Man's Sky, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.

Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this immersive sim offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone's car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I'm still messed up about it, honestly.

This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reckon you're likely to be in one of two camps with precision platformer Bauhaus Bonk - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word "bopping" -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

The latest reminder being Snow Town Geek Store, a shopkeeping sim brimming with 2000's non-tude. Like the 2000's themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing last week's Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don't act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by PC Gamer, one Crastinator-pro has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.

Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
