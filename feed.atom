        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning, popular game-engine creator Unity Software announced an update to its pricing and packaging plans, which will go into effect on January 1, 2024. The new pricing plan introduces a fee that activates and charges developers of high-performing games each time the title is installed by a user or player. The justification is that each time a game is installed, Unity Runtime is also installed. 
Unity Runtime Fee
Starting in January, games will qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee after the game has passed a minimum revenue threshold in the last 12 months and passed a minimum lifetime install count. Unity says it has intentionally set high revenue and install thresholds to avoid impacting smaller developers.

Humanity is wide-eyed with dreams of discovering new planets, colonizing homesteads among the stars. Our science fiction texts are overflowing with the lofty possibilities of leaving our home world behind to seek a future elsewhere.


Yet, I was intrigued. I knew the backstory of Earth – or at least Starfield's version of it – so I wasn't hopeful about seeing any level of detail. I wasn't expecting, for example, to land on my street and see how Bethesda had modelled my home. This isn't Microsoft Flight Simulator, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning, Unity Technologies announced an update to its pricing plans and fees that sparked a bit of an outcry among developers. Unity says that, starting on January 1 of 2024, the company will introduce a new runtime fee based on game installs for any game that passes certain thresholds.


To break it down in straightforward terms, there are two components of Unity: the Editor and the Runtime. The Runtime is code that plays on devices, making Unity-made games work.


This new Unity Runtime Fee, as the company dubs it, would be based on each time a game is downloaded by a user. According to Unity, games that meet these thresholds qualify:



Unity Personal / Plus: Games that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a bunch of new Fortnite My Hero Academia characters in the game, as announced Tuesday by Epic Games. You can now play as Shoto Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima, and Mina Ashido from the anime's Class 1-A. Todoroki is available by himself, while the other two are included in a bundle. Additionally, characters can now create an Ice Wall, in addition to using the Deku Smash.

Todoroki, Kirishima, and Ashido are available on Fortnite's Item Shop. Todoroki himself comes with two costumes and is 1,500 VBucks. There's a bundle with him and three other items, such as the Cold-Hot Hitters and U.A. Uniform weapon skin, for 2,400 VBucks. 


Ashido and Kirishima are 1,500 VBucks separately or 2,800 VBucks together. That 2,800 VBucks bundle also comes with the Cultural Festival Dance, Red Riot Thrashers, Red Riot Shield, and Acid Axe. 


Fortnite players can also find the Ice Wall ability, in addition to the Deku Smash as an item pick-up. You can score them easily from the All Might supply drop, which has the former hero's face on the balloon. The Ice Wall can protect your friends or slip up players as an offensive attack. 


Additionally, there are quests focused on My Hero Academia. These include finding All Might supply drops, damaging foes with the Deku Smash, and causing fire damage to structures around the world. If you finish enough of these quests, you'll gain an instant level-up.


Deku, Bakugo, and Uraraka are currently not on the Fortnite Item Shop at the time of writing, but they'll may join the lineup soon if you missed them the first time. Epic Games likely wants to go all-in with this Fortnite My Hero Academia collab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NIS America launched a playable demo for Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless, alongside a new trailer for the latest in the long-running, strategy RPG franchise. The demo is now available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. In addition, all progress made can be transferred to the full release.




For longtime fans of the Disgaea franchise, the new trailer for Vows of the Virtueless includes the return of Tsunami Bomb’s “The Invasion From Within,” which was included as the trailer music for the original Disgaea: Hour of Darkness back in 2007. To hit its fandom over the head with a nostalgia meteor this close to release, NIS America must have a lot of confidence in Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless.


In the latest entry in the Disgaea franchise, we follow Fuji and Pirilika as they seek to return the bushido code to the demonic realm of Hinomoto. As is to be expected from the series, there are a vast number of character classes to pick from, along with new features such as Item Reincarnation, Jumbification, and Hell Mode! Plus, with the inclusion of online ranked battles, it seems there’s much to do this go around.


Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is set to release on October 3 for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. You can download the demo today to test out the new features and, as mentioned above, transfer any progress made to the full version of the game when it launches.

I wondered why this was until I thought about how it handles romance. When I shipped Karlach and Lae'zel together, I compared Baldur's Gate 3 to dating sims rather than other RPGs and everything clicked. This is a fantastic RPG, but more importantly, it's an awesome dating sim.

Devised as a way to push updates for games online, Steam blossomed into the juggernaut PC gaming storefront it is today, including hardware like the Valve Index and the Steam Deck. Now, Valve is celebrating its 20th birthday with a sale, commemorating the storefront's legacy, and the biggest games on the platform throughout the years.

In response to widespread criticism of the changes from game developers, Unity have since posted a further statement, saying, "Yes, this is a price increase and it will only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre launches its next update today, September 12, 2023, and players irritated by those long lobby queues may see some relief. 


Patch notes for today's quick fixes add a lot of little tweaks that add up to big changes. Notably, Gun and Sumo Digital took out the lobby timer that was added in a previous update following community backlash. Sumo intended to give players more time to fill lobbies, but the patch notes seems to acknowledge it backfired: 


"The community generally disliked this change, and we have therefore reverted it back to the standard 3 minutes."


The seemingly endless lobby timer starting and stopping was occasionally my experience, too. There's quite a few threads hanging out on Reddit and Steam complaining about waits and changes to the system. Now, you'll wait three minutes, and the Texas Chain Saw Massacre's community lead, Matt Shotcha, noted player feedback on a few occasions.

"Maybe they can add a prompt or sound if 6 of 7 players ready up or it cuts the timer to a minute or 30 seconds," wrote one player. Shotcha responded it was "something we can consider for the future."  


Other fixes include the funky matchmaking queue with active players continuing to countdown long after everyone readied up. This happened a few times within my own pre-made groups. But now, assuming everyone selects ready, you won't have to wait for the full-timer to expire to find another lobby. 


As for the rest, they're mostly things that didn't impede in my matches, but are noteworthy. Bone scraps now limit players to three uses, and the car battery begins Texas Chain Saw matches fully charged. The full list is worth a read, even if you aren't adding new victims or family to the roster. Queue hiccups aside, I've had a blast in it, terrifying grandpa jokes and all.

Unity has announced plans to charge developers a fee each time a video game using the Unity engine is installed. Unity Plus is also being retired for new subscribers, starting today.
In a blog post released today (spotted via Game Developer), Unity revealed the 'Unity Runtime Fee'. This new model be implemented from January 2024 and essentially means that developers will be charged a fee per install (compiled via a monthly charge) once a project crosses has made $200,000 in revenue over 12 months and achieved 200,000 total installs for Unity Personal and Plus. For Pro and Enterprise, the threshold is increased to $1 million in revenue over 12 months and 1 million total installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Apple is leaning more into the gaming market than ever with the iPhone 15 Pro. At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that some big titles will be running natively on the new device, including Resident Evil 4 Remake, Resident Evil Village, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding.


This is a massive deal because this will be the first time a mainline Assassin’s Creed title will run on iPhone without the help of cloud streaming. This could be a significant improvement over the latest generation of iPhones, especially for those looking to play the biggest titles on-the-go, but don’t want to invest in a fully (or partial) portable console like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck.




It’s not the first time a console quality game has been natively run on mobile phones, however. An example of this would be Fortnite, which has been running the same experience as on consoles on mobile since its launch in 2018.


So, the viability of this announcement will largely depend on how the iPhone 15 Pro’s battery life holds up while playing as an assassin or skulking the village in search of your missing daughter in Resident Evil Village.


It’s worth noting that while Assassin’s Creed Mirage is set to release for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on October 5, the game will not launch for iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max until the first half of 2024. As for Resident Evil 4 Remake, Resident Evil Village, and Death Stranding, those are due to arrive later this year. It would seem that, if Apple has anything to say about it, 2024 could be a red letter year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Starfield, there was No Man's Sky. The universe exploration title from Hello Games went through a tumultuous launch, but is celebrated these days. In fact, it looks as though it's experiencing its biggest uptick in a while.


According to a recent tweet from the developer's own Sean Murray, No Man's Sky is "having its biggest month in the last few years," with this message being accompanied by a flexing arm emoji.




A quick look on SteamDB does indeed show that things have been looking up, particularly over the last couple of weeks, based on the lifetime player count chart.


Reasons for this are likely varied


There are lots of reason why a game would experience a burst in popularity. In the case of No Man's Sky, it could be down to the recent ECHOES update that added mechanical lifeforms to the game.


It could also be down to a very recent experimental build that's been sent out to PC. Hello Games is nothing if not persistent in keeping its at once hyped sci-fi release in good standing, with plenty of patches and new content.


However, perhaps you're thinking what some of us are thinking. Could the game experiencing one of its best months in years be down to the release of Starfield? It would certainly be crass to suggest it's a major factor in No Man's Sky's recent popularity.


However, given that comparisons will no doubt have been drawn between this game and Bethesda's new sci-fi RPG, it's not too much of a stretch to think that space exploration is on a lot of gamer's minds right now. In which case, to paraphrase Dr Zoidberg: why not No Man's Sky?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's nothing quite like anime OVAs from the '80s and '90s, and that vibe lives on in The Scramble Vice. The 2D side-scroller from Studio PICO evokes nostalgia for mech anime of the period, and it's coming to PC via Steam in 2024.


A teaser trailer debuted along with publisher Flyhigh Works' announcement. At a little over a minute long, it offers a snapshot of the tone and detailed pixel art fueling the visuals. The Scramble Vice features in-mech combat and Blaster Master-esque on-ground segments, all on display below.  




The story of The Scramble Vice follows Kei Sakuragi, an officer who works with the Tokyo Police Department's 9th Mobile Unit. That unit, as you might have guessed, is also known as "The Scramble Vice." In her ASURA suit she'll "scramble up Tokyo" with over 10 weapon types across 12 stages. Naturally, an anonymous terrorist group is behind all the ruckus, and your job is to pull off that mask.

When outside of your mech you'll be infiltrating enemy headquarters. There are over 10 vehicle types to pilot, some of which the teaser showcases. There are motorcycles, cars and, as glimpsed at the end of the clip, what looks like a cute li'l Vespa. Who needs a massive mech when you can putter around town in style? 


Steam is the only platform listed at the time of this writing. We'll have to wait and see if additional platforms are added as we approach The Scramble Vice's 2024 debut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. 

While details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. 
As for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.
Resident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled "Astral Purple." It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 
Xbox says, "This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection," noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 
Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. 
While waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 "Core" Edition controller. After that, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 best Xbox Series X/S games.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios' latest 2D fighter, Mortal Kombat 1, is right around the corner. Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. 
Today's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:


Shang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as "a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona." Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. 
While waiting for the game's release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer. After that, read our hands-on impressions of Mortal Kombat 1's Invasions and Story Mode.

We have been back on something of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge kick recently thanks to the release of the excellent Dimension Shellshock DLC. The heroes in a half shell are firmly back in our hearts thanks to developer Tribute Games and, after a recent interview from Xbox Expansion Pass with the game's narrative designer, Yannic Belzil, it seems that there is a chance we might see the studio take on a franchise other than the Turtles in the future.
When asked about what the future holds for Tribute Games following the DLC's release, Belzil commented that there is nothing currently in the works. That being said, he did note that the studio has been approached with offers to tackle something different:

Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

The launch trailer sets up some of the story for this "reboot", where Fire God Liu Kang has created a brand new world. But we also get a look at Shang Tsung and Reiko — a general under his command — in combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Mortal Kombat 1 is nearly upon us! And, just in time for that, the official launch trailer has … well, launched! Included in this most recent trailer is a special focus on historic fighters Reiko (who was introduced in Mortal Kombat 4) in addition to Shang Tsung, who is, interestingly, a pre-order bonus.


As the trailer begins, we hear narration from presumably Liu Kang, who has replaced Raiden as a god of the new timeline. He then utters the most ironic phrase I have ever heard in a game trailer, explaining that he “was free to craft a new era of peace,” followed by about three minutes and forty-five seconds of pure, unbridled evisceration.




In the trailer, we are shown a preview of the carnage that Reiko can dish out. Taking advantage of the new Kameo Fighters system, he takes a step back while the Kameo Fighter dishes out a boatload of pain. Then, only after brutally shattering the enemy fighter’s leg, Reiko re-enters the fray by sending a giant spear through their chest, pulling it out, only to send it right into their skull. Era of peace? Riiight.


Shang Tsung, on the other hand, seems just as lethal — if not moreso. In addition to showing off his devastating combos against Liu Kang, the trailer seems to suggest he’s up to his usual shenanigans and will be a significant force against the characters of this franchise-wise universe reset. To reiterate, it’d seem despite his presence in the game’s story, Shang Tsung will only be playable for those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 1, which releases on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We take it absolutely for granted these days the convenience Steam affords us. And the start of the digital PC gaming era hits a milestone today as the Valve service celebrates two decades.


According to Wikipedia, the initial release of Steam occurred on September 12, 2003, which is exactly twenty years ago. Since then, others have followed suit in helping us move towards video games as digital media in the age of the Internet.



Image via Steam.



It would be interesting to see what the site looked like back then. Unfortunately, the data from Wayback Machine only goes back to 2007. However, even then, Steam was not quite the powerhouse we know it today.


CD manufacturers hate this one trick


If you look at the website from the first snapshot on Wayback (May 17, 2007), you can see how different it is from what we're used to seeing, showing how many websites looked back then.


Ignoring the fact that images are now missing, the olive green is a far cry from the dark blue theme that would become synonymous with the gaming client.


You'll also notice paraphernalia for Half-Life 2, because that's pretty much how Steam started out. It was originally a way for Valve to digitally distribute its own games. Within a few years, it became the market leader in online digital storefronts.


It wasn't well-received at first, but that's all in the past now. Steam is easily the most popular method for downloading and playing PC games these days. Alternatives like GOG and Epic Games Store may owe a debt of gratitude to Gabe Newell and his team, who pretty much just wanted to offer a more convenient way of updating Counter-Strike.

If the first wave includes titles such as PaRappa the Rapper, Dance Dance Revolution, and Guitar Hero, and if the second consists of games like Hatsune Miku Project: DIVA and Rhythm Heaven, then we’re seeing a callback in this third, current era with Scratchin’ Melodii, Bits and Bops, and Melatonin.


I was a late adopter to ‘Heaven-likes,’ as my first experience with Rhythm Heaven Fever was in 2022. But I fell head-over-heels for this silly little game that nearly drove my roommate at the time to kick me out over the sound effects — if you know, you know. …]]></summary>

There's also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game's campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.


In case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. "EDITOR-IN-CHIEF," she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

"And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay."
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

If you watch and think that the first example from the NES' Athena was a particularly catchy tune, just wait until you have heard all the variations of the second track from Psycho Soldier...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 fans may find the game significantly heavier on their PC hardware than ever before, according to CD Projekt Red's Lead Scene Programmer Filip Pierściński. Ahead of the release of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0, it appears we should brace for the game's performance to change.


More specifically, Pierściński claims that the game will now "use all [the CPU power] you have," with the expected processor workload being around 90% on an eight-core system. Some impressive efficiency numbers, at least on paper. That said, Pierściński was also careful to point out that cooling may become an issue during such an intensive workload. In fact, he recommended that players run performance assessment tools like Cinebench to check whether their systems are stable under these conditions.




Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty aims to push your PC to its limit


Graphics are, obviously, one of Cyberpunk 2077's strongest features. The game features many visual bells and whistles with full path-tracing enabled, but this doesn't come cheap, hardware-wise. Pierściński's claims are well-timed, as the game will see its second massive visual upgrade with Phantom Liberty. 


There's no real reason to doubt what Pierściński is saying, of course. But warning people about their PCs' cooling capabilities over a video game patch is quite curious, all things considered. We'll see how well the game scales with different levels of hardware once update 2.0 hits. After all, this level of efficacy would make Cyberpunk 2077 an even more ubiquitous benchmarking title in the long run. 


At this time, there's no official release date available for Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. But we can reasonably expect the update to launch ahead of Phantom Liberty, which will arrive on September 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Time to make a comeback!".
Those of you who picked up the Switch during its launch period in the distant early days of 2017 may remember that, believe it or not, there were other games available at launch besides Breath of the Wild. One of those games was Super Bomberman R, which at the time was the title that broke the longest dry spell (nearly a decade) between releases in the long-running Bomberman franchise. Super Bomberman R sold relatively well considering the distinct niche it filled in the Switch library at the time, and after a rather ill-fated attempt to make a free-to-play version of that game for all platforms, Konami has now returned once again to the well with Super Bomberman R 2. At its core, this new release is little else than simply more Bomberman, but that’s hardly a bad thing when the gameplay feels this enjoyable.
Super Bomberman R 2 is fundamentally intended to be experienced as a party game, the kind of thing you play on a couch with a few friends while you shout unworthy things at each other as you repeatedly blow everyone up. Matches take place on a 13x11 grid viewed from a top-down perspective and the goal is simply to be the last (Bomber)man standing. You remove your opponents by placing timed bombs that send out plus-shaped blasts after a couple of seconds, though you have to be careful because you can easily blow yourself up if you don’t plan out your placement well.

This song believes in you, aggressively so. "MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!" The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn't take that "you can do it!" Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

Rather than tasking players with cooking a proper dish, developer Terrifying Jellyfish presents a playspace of ingredients, tools like blowtorches and meat tenderizers, and a suite of odd abilities that change gravity, freeze food, and make your culinary ingredients dance — all in the name of playfulness. While levels contain hidden experiences you can unlock by specific interactions, there's hardly a central goal in Nour. Similar to Townscaper, this joyful release is more akin to a toy than a game, and it's so much fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type "player.setpos x 10" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type "setgravityscale 0" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of "player.setpos" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

A patent for a new magnetic joystick design has been filed by Nintendo and the technology involved might just point towards a drift-free future (thanks, IGN).
The patent was actually filed back in May of this year, but it has now been published by the United States Patent Office so we can get a better look at the proposed designs. These show a joystick that utilises magnetism (much like the previously discussed Hall Effect technology) via a 'magnetorheological fluid' to register movement:

You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With "minimal load times" thrown in, too.
Just last week, we heard rumblings that Nintendo's next console — which we're still tentatively calling the 'Switch 2' — was demoed to select developers at Gamescom 2023. The reports from both Eurogamer and VGC suggested that the console showcased an improved version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, though details were sparse on what these improvements actually entailed. Well, the rumour mill has continued to churn and more reported details are now being shared.
The latest rumours come from a recent Nate the Hate podcast in which the host claims to have been told that the Gamescom tech demo saw BOTW running at 4K 60fps, with the emphasis of the show being that "load times had been erased". Again, this is not to suggest that the Switch launch title will be re-released with the next hardware, only that it was being used to demonstrate to showcase the successor's technical improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There aren't many video game developers who are as popular as Hideo Kojima. He left an indelible mark on the gaming world through the Metal Gear franchise, then managed to reboot his career following his departure from Konami. A new studio, Kojima Productions, was formed, and its first game, Death Stranding, was released in 2019. The studio's mascot is Ludens, and he wears a spacesuit, making him look ready for any adventure. 




Recently, a fan took inspiration from Ludens and created a handmade ring for Kojima. The ring, which Kojima showed off on Twitter, features the Ludens helmet, and the words "60th anniversary" are engraved, likely a reference to Kojima turning 60 this year. The eccentric game creator expressed great gratitude for the beautiful ring. 


Screenshot by Destructoid.


The significance of Kojima Productions' Ludens mascot


Ludens is the Latin word for play, and it beautifully captures Kojima's driving philosophy. The mascot's name is a reference to the 1938 text by Johan Huizinga titled Homo Ludens. The text theorizes that it would be more accurate to characterize humans as a species of play, as play and imagination form integral parts of human societies and culture. 


The concept weaves its way into Death Stranding, as seen with the Ludens sunglasses players receive early on. It features the following relevant description: "Sunglasses designed with 'Homo ludens' in mind, their form encourages the wearer to never forget their playful side". 




Despite turning 60, Kojima has certainly not forgotten his playful side, as he recently posted a picture of himself holding a Concorde Lego set. He's also shown his love for Starfield, suggesting he's been quite star-bound lately.

Jupiter has today announced Picross S+, the latest addition to the mind-testing monogram series for the Nintendo Switch. What's exciting about this one is that it is set to bring all nine of the 3DS' download-only Picross e games with it — so if you missed out on the chance to download them before their eShop closed, this will be your chance to snatch them up.
The base content (which contains the puzzles from Picross e) will be available for £3.99 / €4,99 / $4.99, with each subsequent entry in the 3DS series becoming available as individual additional paid content packages priced at the same cost. It might seem like a slightly expensive way of bringing each game over to the modern console, but that's a whole lot of puzzle for your pounds.

While I’m socially awkward and people suck, I think romance is one of the most commonly used and easily explained grounding elements in games. I love grounding elements and think that developers don’t leverage them enough. Give your protagonist relatable hobbies alongside their wondrous powers. For bonus points, let me get to partake in them.
Eternights puts this upfront in its descriptions: action-RPG and dating sim at the end of the world. That’s all I knew about it going in. And that’s basically all it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the roaring success of Demon Slayer, Aniplex has been dipping their toes into the proverbial pool of licensed games. 2022's The Hinokami Chronicles brought the series into the hack-and-slash genre to a fairly positive reception. However, the next Demon Slayer title trades the arena battles for dice blocks and minigames.
Announced as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi!, via Gematsu, players will battle one another in the classic Mario Party formula with a twist. 
As shown in the trailer provided by Aniplex, up to four players will roll the dice, walk spaces around the board, and compete in minigames to win currency to use against one another. Some of the games shown include a cup-and-ball-type game, and one where the players must slash targets as they rise from the ground. Much like Mario Party, some spaces will activate events where you may get an item to turn the tides of the game.

Kamado Party
After some time, the game will transition from day to night, where players will be able to take on the many demons roaming around the board. Once you encounter them, all four players will have to work together to defeat it. The Demon Slayer party game also boasts a roster of characters from all throughout the series, allowing you to choose from a handful of your favorite characters.
Though Aniplex hasn't announced who's going to be developing the game, Aniplex itself is producing the title. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi! is currently slated for a 2024 release on the Nintendo Switch for Japan, with no mention of other consoles.

In essence, the highs of the episode are probably the peak of The Expanse title so far, but the lows are equally as low. Episode 3 left us—as Camina Drummer—at an old abandoned mining station in deep space. Our oxygen is low and we're all alone after Arlen and Rayen took control of the Artemis and left us.
Drummer adventures back through the derelict station. in an attempt to find a communications panel to activate a beacon and hopefully get help. At the start of the episode, there is a power box puzzle similar to the ones in Episode 3, and then the episode turns into somewhat of a walking simulator. And I definitely mean it when I say "walking."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post on the official XDefiant website from Executive Game Director Mark Rubin, it was confirmed that the release of XDefiant is currently delayed. The popular FPS apparently received a Not Pass flag in the submission process for certification. The actual process started at the end of July, with the Not Pass result coming in mid-August. According to Rubin, most of the issues seemed to be related to compliance issues.
"We are currently in the CM prep part of that process and will hopefully be submitting to 1st parties in a little less than 2 weeks," Rubin stated in the post. "If that Passes cleanly, then we could be looking at a mid-to-end of September release. There is however a likely scenario where we get a conditional Pass meaning we have to do a Day 1 patch with some final fixes to ensure compliance. If we do need to do a Day 1 patch, then that pushes our date out to early/mid-October."

Typically speaking compliance issues are related to specific issues with first-party platforms. For example, trophies not unlocking properly on PS5, or friends lists not updating correctly. While these are certainly important issues, it's not as big of a deal as game-breaking bugs or crashes. Release delays are never fun, but in a case like this, it's definitely important to have some extra love going towards compliance issues. It's been a couple of years since the FPS was revealed, but fans will have to wait a little longer.
Rubin finished up the post by pointing out that nothing about XDefiant's development so far has been typical. In Rubin's words, XDefiant will release "as soon as we can". XDefiant will eventually release on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

NBA 2K24 should have been the perfect platform to celebrate Kobe Bryant's career and his ever-lasting influence on the game of basketball. Instead, his legacy gets overshadowed by omnipresent microtransactions and stale game modes. As a result, NBA 2K24 feels like a dull, lopsided blowout as opposed to a memorable, adrenaline-inducing affair like the ones the Black Mamba often blessed us with throughout his career.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lenovo's Legion laptop line looks lovely, and today the Legion 5 Slim gaming laptop with an RTX 4060 graphics card and Ryzen 7 7840HS processor has been discounted from £1500 to £1150 with code MEGADEAL111. That's one of the best prices we've seen for this spec - if not the outright best; that's reserved for Black Friday - and well worth considering if you're in the market for a high-end gaming laptop.

It's a fun way to stage those perfect shots, and snap pics of your journey through a game world. And photo mode has been a great way to re-engage with Cyberpunk 2077.
With the impending launch of Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for CD Projekt Red's futuristic RPG, I've been dipping a toe back into the waters of Night City. Much of it is just reacquainting myself, and getting back into the world and feel of it all. I've already spent at least an above-average amount of time both playing and talking about Cyberpunk 2077.

The year is 1991. 'Video games' — plastic, square-shaped cartridges that millions of people blow into every day — grip early-adopting proselytizers. Yet they don’t know their precious cartridge’s days are numbered. A mighty company from Kyoto rules the industry today, but a new laser-based challenger is lurking in the bushes.
Is it the mighty Sony PlayStation? No, not for another three years. Is it the Sega CD? Well, actually, that’s coming in a couple of days. But today, on December 3rd, 1991, the Philips CD-i has arrived. Its name is short for 'Compact Disc-Interactive,' which suggests the device plays CDs, naturally, but it can also play video games… though not very well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Microsoft acquired Bethesda Game Studios for $7.5 billion in 2021, it was made abundantly clear some of Bethesda’s upcoming fare would be exclusive to Xbox and PC. Yet, when Starfield launched, some PlayStation fans seemed to take umbrage with that. So much so that a mod has been created, the purpose of which is solely to take the Bethesda splash screen that plays when you load up the game … and replace it with the PlayStation Studios intro.
https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1699784591870218729
Talk about aesthetic-only mod choices
It’d be one thing if the mod had other purposes, and this was just one of them … but that’s not the case here. It's just a new intro, and it's hilarious in a multitude of ways. I know that some folks are going to read this story and get wrapped up in the console wars, to which I say … no matter how many times you load up Starfield and see the PlayStation Studios intro, you’re still playing it on a PC (at least, until this mod comes to consoles). 
Now, I’m all for the freedom to create and use whatever mods your heart desires. Note how I’m not saying you shouldn’t use this mod; only that you shouldn’t be surprised when someone calls it silly.

Or have some Raid bosses become overhyped Strike targets rather than top-end world-ending threats?
While we don't aim to make any of the following Destiny 2 Raid bosses seem like outright pushovers, one could easily argue that that's precisely what some of them are.

Nintendo isn't always the easiest company to predict, but things are usually pretty routine when it comes to Direct Showcases. There's usually one in February, usually one in the summer and usually one in September — plus a handful of Indie Worlds, Partner Showcases or game-specific presentations thrown in for good measure.
We're in September now (almost halfway through, even) and an event is still yet to be announced (at the time of writing, that is), so there's only one thing for it: let the speculation begin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group is a large company that has its fingers in quite a few pies. In 2021, Gearbox Entertainment was acquired by Embracer for an eye-watering $1.3 billion. Despite the pricey purchase, it seems not all is well, and a report from Reuters claims that Embracer is considering its options with Gearbox.
Reuters, citing three people familiar with the matter, states that the involved parties are working with Goldman Sachs and Aream & Co to explore a possible sale, and this comes after Embracer received interest from third parties. This is certainly big news, but it's not entirely a surprise, as Embracer had previously made it known that the company is undergoing drastic changes.
In June, the company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to shift from a "heavy-investment-mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word "immersive". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, "the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

A whopping 86% don't result in any removals.  This high rejection rate is mostly the result of "careless" incomplete notices sent by takedown companies, the report notes.

Abriss has you destroying brutalist architecture in a futuristic cityscape using rockets, wrecking arms and laser pinwheels of your own design. Whatever you construct, the result is a glorious physics spectacle. After a little over a year in Steam Early Access, it hit 1.0 earlier this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I've been on the internet for long enough to know that it's a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

Haver makes, among other things, comedic rotoscoped animations riffing on science fiction and video game tropes.

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.
When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games chief creative officer Donald Mustard is retiring this month after seven years with the company. He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

        <updated>2023-09-08T17:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Baird tells EW. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

According to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.
The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. 
Tokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24. Publishers like Capcom, Atlus, Sega, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix, among others, will air dedicated livestreams throughout the event.]]></summary>

It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, Islands Of Insight is, somehow, both an open world multiplayer game, and a puzzle game - something akin to The Witness but in a fantasy world you share with other players. There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confession time: if you've been keeping up to date with Colossal Order's feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you're probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

Now, the company has released several character posters highlighting Kraven, Lizard, Venom, our Spider-Men, and more, giving us our best look yet at a few of them. 
Since the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 in 2021, we’ve known Venom is a major villain in the game. And while that reveal teased what many thought to be Kraven the Hunter, it wasn’t confirmed to be him until later. Since then, we’ve learned that the game shares a tone with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and that Peter Parker will get a Venom Symbiote suit.

That’s thanks to 6 million Starfield players who had began their journey in space by 6 p.m. ET on September 7, which is when the official Starfield Twitter account tweeted that the game had become the company’s biggest launch.

Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon made an unexpected appearance on the popular interview show Hot Ones to talk about Mortal Kombat 1 and the series as a whole. As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most succinct yet exciting announcements from last year’s D23 Expo was Gargoyles Remastered, a modernized facelift of the classic (and challenging) side-scrolling Sega Genesis title based on the popular ‘90s cartoon. A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. 


If you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

The EA Sports UFC franchise made its debut in 2014, the first MMA game released by the company following its non-UFC-licensed title, 2010's EA Sports MMA. While the first licensed UFC title was somewhat disappointing due to the underwhelming feature set and the series trying to find its footing as an all-new franchise, it was a solid first attempt.

With each subsequent entry, which has traditionally been released at a two-year cadence, the franchise iterated in meaningful ways, adding new fighting mechanics, improved animations, more feature-rich modes, and larger fighter rosters. With…]]></summary>

We got code late due to an unknown random happenstance, but we've now put a bunch of time into playing it so can have a blimmin' great chat about Bethesda's space RPG. I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. How was Baldur's Gate 3 August for you? Ready for Starfield September? I hope you are, because lemme tell you, it's coming all right. In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

Detective Pikachu exists in an exceptionally rare space in the video game industry. A subseries to the wildly popular Pokémon franchise that started as a video game in 2018' 3DS title, the name Detective Pikachu is more synonymous with its 2019 live-action theatrical film starring Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds. But just before the release of that film, The Pokémon Company announced a follow-up to the 3DS game, and with the impending release finally upon us four years later, I got my hands on the long-awaited sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among Larian CEO Sven Vincke's greatest hopes ahead of Baldur's Gate 3's release was that it would get people interested in RPGs who had previously been turned off by them. This strikes me as a pretty tall order, given that Baldur's Gate 3 is also one of the most in-depth RPGs you'll play, but going by post-release responses, Vincke thinks Larian have managed it, thanks in large degree to more readable production values than you find in many RPGs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone - better known as ConcernedApe - has been quietly working away on the follow-up to his wildly popular and beloved farming game since at least the end of 2021. Given that secrecy and Stardew’s enormous following, it’s perhaps little surprise that a single cryptic screenshot from Haunted Chocolatier has immediately sparked fervent theories about its possible connection to Barone’s previous game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space. The medium frontier. These are the voyages of me, reviewing Bethesda's big space RPG Starfield. It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, the galaxy is your oyster. Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder.

That’s what he told Japanese magazine Famitsu in a new interview, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Based on his comments, the team behind TOTK might be moving on to a new Zelda game in a new Hyrule, too. 


“We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,” Aonuma told Famitsu, according to Genki. “This …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friend, are you weary of talk of blockbuster space-faring RPGs and blockbuster D&D adaptations and blockbusters in general? Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers? Do you, in fact, reject this framing of retro-styled 2D pixelart games as "older" and "simpler", regarding it as condescending and false? Look, shut up already. I'm trying to tell you about Isles of Sea and Sky from developers Jason Newman, Dan Collver and Craig Collver.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying homage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

For context, that ties the best price we've seen for a 2TB NVMe SSD, although this option comes with a heatsink and is therefore a better choice for many PC and all PS5 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed three new Switch bundles releasing next month. One is a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes a standard Switch model and the other two are special Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch Lite consoles that include the game. All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview. 
While waiting for these new bundles, read Game Informer’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review and then read Game Informer’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons review.

From the Stray Demons of Dark Souls through Bloodborne's Cleric Beast to the dragons of Elden Ring, you must learn not to be awed by creatures who look they could kill you with a sneeze. You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't have any firsthand insight to share on Void Stranger, which surprise-released on Friday, but when I read words like "forgotten labyrinth" and "traps that defy reason", I find myself reaching for my pen and inkwell, and when I encounter visuals that remind me of the nastier Zelda dungeons on Game Boy, I start vibrating gently in my chair, and when I see monochrome anime story scenes set to howling guitar and fuzzy chip tunes - well, here we are.
Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.
Spoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently juggling two playthroughs of Starfield with very different aims. While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

In the years since Sam Fisher’s last outing, 2013’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist, he’s made a handful of cameo appearances and even shown his battle-worn visage at a conference or two. And there is a remake on the way – of which we’ve only seen concept art. But by most measures, the franchise has been dormant for a decade.
Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years. With two decades of distance, it’s hard to see the defacto mascot of novelist Tom Clancy’s video game offshoot brand as anything other than the embodiment of its ethos; the avatar of Clancy’s own stabl…]]></summary>

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“It’s incredibly weird for anybody who knows me that I’ve become the romance guy,” David Gaider tells me. “I’m the least romantic guy. Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.
