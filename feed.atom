After writing about Final Fight 2 for the SNES, a few people suggested I look more into Final Fight 3. Admittedly, it’s been a while since I last played it. Thinking about it, I was probably just out of college when I last went through it with a roommate. It has at least been long enough that I forgot about the enemies that are literally Nazis. Stahlhelm, stielhandgranate, the name “Fritz.” Guys are Wehrmacht as all get out. So now I get to see Mike Haggar pile-drive Nazis into the pavement, and I wonder how I’ve gone so long without it. I previously said the original arcade Final Fight was the only one worth playing, but anything that lets you suplex the German infantry is required reading in my book.
In any case, Final Fight 3 is the last sequel to the brawler tha…]]></summary>

Since its release in June, the speedrunning first-person parkour shooter Neon White has been plagued by one common criticism. I've heard it more times than I can count, and it comes up as a counterpoint nearly every time I praise the game: "It's a good game with bad writing." The complaint doesn't always arrive in those words (I've also heard it described as "so cringy" many times), but the philosophy has pervaded discussion of the game for six months now.
There's just one problem: it's completely wrong. Neon White is a good game with good writing. And yes, it's a good game with writing that sometimes makes me cringe. Most of the jokes are cheap gags about the main character being either stupid or horny. The entire conceit of parkour demons …]]></summary>

It's been rumored for years at this point, and fans of the series have been desperately trying to manifest it into existence, but now it's official: Guerrilla is working on a Horizon multiplayer project, as they confirmed via their Twitter account today. It wasn't so much of an announcement specifically highlighting the upcoming multiplayer game as it was a post of job listings, but it's confirmation and that's all I care about. Even when these big studios try to play their cards close to their chest, it's those darn job listings that always give them away -- they have to make the game somehow, and I find it kind of a fun tradition now that we find out in a kind of indirect way.
https://twitter.com/LifeAtGuerrilla/status/1603752192166469634
The text of the tweet itself is innocent enough, but the studio announces their future plans clearly within the attached graphic. "We are continuing to create epic solo adventures for Aloy. But there is more," the post reads. "A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in Horizon's universe. Featuring a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look, friends will be able to explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together." Okay, so maybe this time around, the announcement was a bit more direct than usual.
Guerrilla has a whole host of new positions open from Combat Designers to Technical Artists to Programmers, but admittedly the roles that intrigue me the most are the narrative-focused positions. It's cool to see that the studio is investing some of its new talent into the storytelling side of things, because Horizon is so well known for its incredible worldbuilding and engaging narrative. I will absolutely be looking forward to any updates on the project, but this announcement alone is enough excitement to keep me going for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You only have a few days left
As we mentioned this morning, this is your second chance to dive into a weekend of Charizard raiding (and catching! Well, once!) in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Since then I've seen some confusion as to how to unlock and find these seven-star raids: so here's a full breakdown. Remember, you have until December 18 at 3:59PM PT to get your Charizard, or grind out the rewards.
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven't already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="354675,354676"]
Locate it on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing dragon icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You'll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100, and with an affinity for taking down a dragon/fire type. In any case, we have a full guide on how to take down Charizard here!
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="354677,354678"]
Search for a raid, even if you don't have one available
Alternatively, if you don't want to host a raid (or don't have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Charizard on the list. As soon as you see it click it: as you'll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Charizard raids show up, wait for the "check for new postings" sign to light up: then press X to search again.

Fall Guys seems to have just caught the end of the battle royale trend, but it's easily one of the silliest and fun games to take on the genre. You and your friends all take on the role of a little bean-shaped creature and run the gauntlet of different obstacle courses akin to the slapstick fun of the classic American gameshow, Wipeout. Don't forget you can also dress your bean up in all kinds of goofy costumes to make your run all the more giggle-inducing.
Of course, as much as we all love Fall Guys, any game is going to get a bit stale after we play it for a certain number of hours. That's why we've compiled this list of awesome games to check out if you want to play Fall Guys, but you also don't want to play Fall Guys. In other words, here are sev…]]></summary>

[Update: Pre-orders are live! You can find Best Buy links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here, and GameStop links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here. As of publication, Target also has Sephiroth and Kazuya. Thanks CJ!]
Well, Nintendo finally gave us amiibo collectors a lifeline, and revealed the full release date for the Sephiroth and Kazuya figures: January 13, 2023. That's soon! Amid that announcement, Nintendo has noted that folks should "look forward to the release of Pyra and Mythra," which is coming at some point in 2023.
Based on prior release cadences, Smash amiibo release waves are typically five-ish months apart, but they could be coming out sooner than that. In Japan, Pyra and Mythra are being sold as a double pack, but it's not clear if that format will be the standard around the world. All that's left on the amiibo list now for Super Smash Bros. is Sora. We haven't had full confirmation of his figure yet, or when it might release: but mid-to-late-2023 could be possible.
Right now there are no pre-orders available in most regions of the world. However, the Nintendo of Japan store does have all of the above (sans Sora): though they immediately sold out:
Sephiroth
Kazuya
Pyra/Mythra double pack
As always, here's a full up to date amiibo list that we've been keeping track of since the beginning. You can also find full images of the amiibo models in the embedded tweet, or the gallery below.

During last week's Game Awards, we were introduced to four more characters headed to Capcom's Street Fighter 6 — And while we were able to gleam some information on Dee Jay, Manon, and Marisa, one particular newcomer remains shrouded in unnerving mystery — the suave gentleman J.P.
We know very, very little about this eldery gent, aside from the fact that he is an extremely rich and powerful individual, essentially holding court over his off-grid nation of Nayshall. Though clearly a man of poise and presence, we are left concerned by his seemingly casual control of what appears to be Psycho Power, the dangerous and ethereal spirit that fueled long-time antagonist M.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get too hung up on it: decide in the moment
Briefly into High on Life, you'll get a series of rapid-fire choices that have almost no bearing on anything outside of a few (sometimes running) jokes. The chance to kill 5-Torg is one of those moments.
It doesn't matter if 5-Torg lives or dies
One of the first bosses you'll face in High on Life is 9-Torg, which is mainly a tutorial for your whipping grappling hook mechanic. To take this boss out, just stick to the skies, get a few potshots in while you're flying around, and go back up to whipping around the arena. Nearly none of 9-Torg's attacks have any degree of accuracy while you're up there, and many of them are ground-based.
After taking out 9-Torg, you'll be left with a choice: you can kill their sister 5-Torg, who is tied up in the middle of the arena. There's no fight per se, but if you do choose to shoot at her, the game calls it a "bonus boss" in jest. You can choose to let her live or take her out, and results are the same.
Whatever you get out of this sequence is up to you, as there's no achievement linked to it.

Merge Games has today announced that the upcoming psychological thriller Bramble: The Mountain King will be bringing the chills to Switch in a physical form next year.
After releasing a demo on PC and PS5 which gained popularity over Halloween weekend (who would have thought it), developer Dimfrost Studios has decided to make the full leap to consoles in the coming year and looking at the above trailer, us scaredy cats are going to have to hype ourselves up for this one.

Announced in a tweet today, it confirms previous rumours that Guerrilla were working on an online multiplayer Horizon game, and a recent batch of job listings for the project have given us a glimpse of what we might be able to expect once it's ready.

I'll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you're anything like me you'll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going "wheeee!".
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you'll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you'll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it's because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it's been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

After landing a huge new update in the form of the "Missions in Uncharted Space" expansion, Disney Dreamlight Valley has today received a quick hotfix to make sure that all of these features are running as they should.
The changes made this time around are mainly tweaks to the new quests - many of which focus around the latest additions of Woody and Buzz to the Valley. There is also a slight change to the size of the Boba Tea which was appearing in the game, as well as the usual stability and optimisation improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you eat whole lemons or pure salt?
Nintendo has dropped the details for the first Splatoon 3 splatfest of 2023! The next battle of squid kids and octolings will kick off in the first weekend of January, and will see players fight it out in another weekend of colorful chaos — hoping to bring home the gong for their team and bag themselves some exclusive rewards.
This time around, the topic is — quite literally — a matter of taste, as players will have to choose which is their favorite food flavoring. The options on the dinner table are Spicy, Sweet, and Sour, (a topic that sound suspiciously familiar, and I'm pretty sure that they've re-run the fun for this particular splatfest). It's also worth noting that spicy is a sensation and not a taste ACKSHUALLY. I feel sorry for anybody not on Team Sweet, as I have a feeling the public vote is gonna be running away with this one.
So far, Splatoon 3 hosts Big Man and Shiver have both secured Splatfest wins, but poor old Frye is yet to capture glory. Maybe January's event will see her finally crack that losing streak (watch her get Team Sour). The Taste Bud Turf War will commence worldwide on Friday January 6 (North America) and Saturday January 7 (Europe) and will conclude 48 hours later. We'll be sure to give y'all a reminder!
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it's a shame the FPS side can't match it.

The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not.

At the top of December, Game Freak held a special event that allowed players to capture a level 100 7-star raid Charizard in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but it only ran for a few days. Well, you have another chance!
The event is back on as of last night (December 15), and will run through the afternoon/evening of December 18 (US). To find the Charizard, all you need to do is search for a pulsing dragon Tera Raid icon: or use the online menu to navigate and browse for Charizard raids. If you're interested in whether or not it's worth your time, we have a full rundown of the Charizard's moves and loadout here, as well as a full guide on how to unlock higher-end raids.
I'm calling this a second chance, not a last chance, because...
The official Pokemon site has this little blurb to let folks know that this isn't the be-all-end-all of getting a Charizard in Scarlet & Violet:
"Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future."

Hopefully that process will not involve walking into a video game retailer; but it could also just be a Pokemon Home early-use bonus, or something super simple like that.
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Charizard Tera Raid event (second chance times):
Thursday, December 15, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 18, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Juri Duty begins again
Capcom has opened the servers, (this time officially), for the second closed beta of its great-looking scrapper Street Fighter 6. If you received an invite to the second beta, or if you previously partook in the October beta, then you should now be able to download the SF6 Beta client on PS5, PC, or Xbox Series X respectively.
Between now and Monday, the lucky participants will be able to let loose in a truncated version of the upcoming sequel. Much like the first beta, there are eight selectable characters, (Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Juri, Kimberly, Luke, and Jamie) and six available stages. Players can take the opportunity to build a custom character, check out the Battle Hub, play some Capcom classics, and jump into training while they wait for an online opponent. The comedic "Extreme Battle" mode always makes its return.
The Street Fighter 6 second closed beta will end Monday, December 19 at 00:00 UTC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilw0xDkfk2Q&t=1s&ab_channel=StreetFighter
If you were not fortunate enough to receive a beta, whether you were creating wholesome content or otherwise, then I understand your frustration and disappointment. However, it is incredibly likely that Capcom will hold further betas, (very likely open betas), between now and the game's official launch in June 2023. I know it sucks not to receive access, I've felt that pain with other games, but I'm sure you'll be jumping into battle with everybody else at some point in early 2023.
Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox July 2, 2023. Be sure to check out our other reports on the sequel, including my 50 things I loved about the beta feature, as well as CJ Andriessen’s experience with the "Modern" control system. You can also read our recent reports on incoming characters Manon, Dee Jay, and Marisa. A report on the mysterious J.P. will be arriving later today.

There were a few things that we could say for certain about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet prior to their release: the games would be a commercial success, Nintendo would push tie-ins wherever it could (hi Splatoon fans!) and at some point, we would be 100% guaranteed a Smoliv plushie. Well, now the latter of these has also come true, with Paldea's edible little guy joining Lechonk and Pawmi in a new cuddly range coming to Japan's Pokémon Centers (thanks, Nintendo Soup).
The latest collection will be appearing in the wild (and by that we mean 'retail') from 24th December and they should be available for international purchases from Amazon JP shortly after. Nothing says "sorry for forgetting your Christmas present" quite like a huggable olive now does it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doesn't stack up.
Toby, it seems, is having a very bad day. He’s found himself stuck in a mansion, investigating the strange happenings within it and why he seems to be trapped in it. Paper Cut Mansion is all about uncovering the truth behind the unusual surroundings and surviving long enough to make it to the next floor. There is an attempt to spice up the typical roguelite formula with unique visuals and setting, but the game falls short of greatness by not polishing up those changes enough.
The first thing that you’ll notice about Paper Cut Mansion is the visuals, which are a strange creepy papercraft aesthetic that gives powerful Corpse Bride or Psychonauts vibes throughout. The jazzy soundtrack and occasional musical number that plays as you make your way through the levels of the mansion only add to this feeling. The art design is fantastic and is easily the part of the game that stands out from the plethora of roguelites on Switch.

Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.

Nintendo has dropped another quartet of classic Sega Genesis titles into the Nintendo Switch Online library of 16-bit classics. All subscribers to the Expansion Pack service can check out the four new/old releases today, simply by downloading them from the Sega Genesis library.
The new selection runs a gauntlet of genres and contains some bonafide icons from the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis golden years. Scrolling brawler fans can take to the streets with the excellent 1991 release Golden Axe II, or drop the axes and pick up a bazooka or two with 1990's goofy, sci-fi classic Alien Storm.
Also released in 1990, puzzle heads will find the still-compelling block buster Columns a fine way to while away a lazy afternoon, while one-on-one fight fans can check out Sega's 1996 Genesis port of Virtua Fighter 2, a highly ambitious release that bravely attempted to squeeze the smash-hit arcade into a humble 16-bit cartridge.
Alien Storm, Columns, Golden Axe II, and Virtua Fighter 2 are now available to download for all Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers via the NSO app on your Nintendo Switch dashboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s well documented that creativity can help quell the waves of stormy mental health seas. Hours of documentaries chronicle how artists expressed their struggles through brushstrokes, or how an actor agonised over creating an accurate character to counterbalance their imposter syndrome or anxiety. It’s unlikely many creatives have found “refuge” in a 27 year old retro game engine - but that’s exactly how Dan Douglas talks about his sprawling mod for Duke Nukem 3D.

Nintendo has officially begun the countdown to the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest and this is going to be a tasty one. Moving on from the last Pokémon-themed take on the format (and in no way related to that horrifying eating Pokémon trend) the next event asks the question, "What's your favourite taste sensation?" with the team choices falling between Spicy, Sweet and Sour.
Kicking off on 7th January, 2023 and running through until the early hours of the 9th, the taste bud Turf War feels like it has been a long time coming. After all, it has been over a month now since we were all representing Team Fire-, Water- or Grass-Type in the last inky dual.

Not long after this, Cavill announced he would be reprising his role as Superman. Now, in a separate development, Cavill has officially been dropped by the DC Universe - with the new co-chairman James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, Suicide Squad) announcing an overhaul to the Superman movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only a few more weeks of waiting
The Dead Space remake is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and it's right around the corner as we near its January 27 release date. The team at Motive Studio have just completed the final step before release: they've gone gold! For those who may not know, this simply means that the team has finalized a version of the game that they're happy with, and sent it off to begin the physical manufacturing process to be made into discs, and to get the digital version ready to go up on its various platforms. It's a huge milestone at the end of the development process, and while it doesn't necessarily guarantee the game will come out on its announced release date, it's a good sign that there likely won't be a delay between now and January 27. Woohoo!
https://twitter.com/MotiveStudio/status/1603480192755851278
The studio took to Twitter to announce their gold status, announcing "WE ARE WHOLE AGAIN" to the entire world. Nothing like an ominous yet celebratory tweet to get me in the mood for some spooky space adventures. I admittedly didn't play the original Dead Space series out of fear, but now that I'm getting better with horror games, I'm thinking this time it's gonna be worth a shot.
Motive Studio was created by Jade Raymond, an executive known for helping to create the Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs series, under the larger EA umbrella. Motive created two games within the Star Wars franchise in 2017 and 2020, Battlefront II and Squardons, before deciding to shift their focus back to the beloved Dead Space series. In addition to the remake, Motive also announced that they're working on an Untitled Iron Man game for Marvel, which should be interesting to see as it will likely come around near the same time as Insomniac's Wolverine adaptation.
Dead Space will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on January 27, 2023.

A new trailer for Fire Emblem Engage details all the activities you'll be doing outside of combat. Fishing, cooking, training, and more take the spotlight in a lengthy look at the home base activities in Fire Emblem Engage.
The Somniel is a floating home that your protagonist calls their own over the course of Engage. The castle acts as your home base, where characters you've recruited hang out and enjoy leisure activities, away from battle.
There are a few different categories of things to do in the Somniel, so we'll run through them one-by-one.

Rocket League's winter event Frosty Fest is back, and this time, it's with a collab that no one saw coming, but now that it's here I can't think of a better way to celebrate the holidays. That's right, everyone's favorite cars-playing-giant-soccer esports game is teaming up with the Lofi Girl of YouTube fame. Her music on the iconic "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" YouTube stream has gotten us through countless work days and sleepless nights of studying, and now, her calming beats will be the soundtrack of mid-air dribbles and scored goals.
The event is already live, and will run until January 3, 2023. Completing this year's Frosty Fest challenges will net you all kinds of awesome Lofi Girl-themed cosmetics, and while Rocket League has never much been my t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next entry in the Ys series aims for next year
Falcom has announced the next numbered entry in the long-running Ys RPG series. Ys X: Nordics will launch next year.
News about this broke last night during an annual meeting, soon followed by the official news. Ys X is the latest numerical entry in the series, targeting PlayStation 4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. It's currently set to launch in Japan sometime in 2023.
According to a description of the game (thanks Gematsu), Ys X: Nordics will once again follow hero Adol Christin in a new adventure, this time set in the northern Obelia Bay. There are many islands and sea-faring people here, as well as some immortal undead who like to attack humans.
Ys X: Nordics will also let the player control a ship, for the first time in the series. Considering Adol's history with boats, it might not be a wise idea to put him at the helm. But hey, maybe the ship won't wreck this time.

Fighting in tandem
Battles look otherwise very action-y and flashy, as you would expect from a Ys game. The new Cross Action system will allow the player to fight in two modes: Solo Mode lets you control one fighter with automatic attacks and support from a partner, while Combination Mode has the player simultaneously controlling both characters for a series of actions.
Nothing's been formally announced about an English localization just yet. We have eventually received previous entries in the Ys series though, like Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and Ys IX: Monstrum Nox. Odds seem decent that sooner or later, we'll hear more about Ys X: Nordics.

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've missed you, Spidey
As part of an end-of-year post from PlayStation, Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac has returned to give us the newest update on the game's sequel: a release window. The PlayStation blog is meant to highlight the platform's upcoming highlights for the new year, and what better way to start it off than with Insomniac's announcement that Spider-Man 2 will be coming in fall of 2023. Okay, so that's a pretty big window, and there's always the chance that the game could be delayed. At the very least, though, it's nice to that development is coming along nicely and, for now, we can expect to play the game by the end of next year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQ3xNqkVC4
Insomiac's 2018 title Spider-Man, and its follow-up, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, are some of the best-loved games to come out of the last console generation. Based on the swinging mechanics alone, I have to agree. I've never played a game that made me feel more like a superhero, and I've been known to return to the game even after completing it just to swing my way around Manhattan. While Marvel had already taken over the box office, Insomniac secured the studio's hold on the newest console generation with the best superhero games since the Arkham series.
I think it's safe to say that Spider-Man 2 has been one of the most anticipated upcoming titles out there, so getting confirmation that it's on the way is going to be a huge boost for fans. We've got plenty to keep us busy in the mean time with all of the awesome releases headed our way in the first half of 2023 (I'm personally keeping an eye on Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom and Hades II), but I think it's safe to say that when Spider-Man 2 finally drops, we're ready to drop everything to slip back into the suit of our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.

My entire life, I’ve been really, really sensitive to horror. I usually chalk it up to being raised in a fundamentalist Christian family where I was told from a very young age that not only are Satan and demons real, but they are coming to get me and I have to actively fight them from taking control of my mind. Either that or I’m just a little too sensitive. Who’s to say?
Regardless, some of my childhood memories involve scary movies, or rather, my aversion to watching them. At my best friend’s sleepover birthday party in middle school, I spent an entire two hours upstairs by myself because I was too scared of whatever crappy C-tier horror flick they turned on that night.

In August 2022, though, Dark Road went offline. The game remains accessible with an overhauled shop, and, crucially, no in-app purchases. Everything is now available with in-game currency. I always want to give games more chances, and I often feel bad for games that are deemed "bad" by everyone, so I figured it was time to try Kingdom Hearts Dark Road again.

The strand genre is moving to the silver screen. Kojima Productions is teaming up with Hammerstone Studios to produce a film adaptation of Death Stranding.
Hideo Kojima will produce alongside Hammerstone Studios' Alex Lebovici, who executive produced this year's surprise horror hit Barbarian. The film is being fully financed by Hammerstone (per Variety), with Kojima Productions US and Allan Ungar as executive producers.
The plot, according to Variety, is being kept under wraps, though the outlet's heard that it will introduce new elements and characters. No writer or director is publicly locked in yet.

I've no way of knowing if that's what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month "upgrading all copies" of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC. 

If it was what they thought, it hasn't worked. Players report that Re-Elected isn't an upgrade at all, but that it has broken their save games, their mods, and introduced new launch and crash bugs to the nine-year-old game.

Amazon Games and Crystal Dynamics have entered a new partnership to publish the latter's upcoming Tomb Raider project. The new multiplatform entry in the story of Lara Croft will receive support and publishing help from Amazon.
The announcement today confirms Crystal Dynamics' newest partner on the project, following the studio getting acquired by the Embracer Group. The press release also confirms this will be a single-player, narrative-driven Lara Croft adventure. Crystal Dynamics will continue to develop, while Amazon provides support and globally publishes the still-unnamed Tomb Raider.
"Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider," said Crystal Dynamics head Scot Amos in a press release. "Transformative is what we’re looking for, and with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision, ambitions, and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum of possibilities."
The new Tomb Raider is also being built in Unreal Engine 5. Lara's new adventure is still in early development, but today's news promises there will still be enemies to take down and puzzles to solve in the new Tomb Raider.
A new benefactor
For Amazon, the online shopping giant picks up another publishing deal with this project. Bandai Namco's Blue Protocol is also joining up with Amazon for publishing, helping the online RPG launch sometime next year.
Meanwhile, for Crystal Dynamics, the deal ensures some support for the next big Croft game. The studio is saying it will be the "biggest" and "most expansive" to date. It's also set to carry on Lara Croft's story, though in what manner that happens remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


"What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we've been in absolute awe of the work of our peers," Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. "Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here's to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall." 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, "Following the events of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel's Spider-Man series." 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

Activision Blizzard sequel Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is opening the doors to all and sundry today, as the gazillion-dollar shooter launches its first free multiplayer weekend. Players on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox can download a truncated version of the title for free to check out its hi-octane action.
The trial kicks off today and will run until Monday, December 19 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. During that time, squaddies can check out a variety of Modern Warfare II multiplayer modes including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and, my own personal specialty, Kill Confirmed. Three maps will be made available for digital pew-pew desires — namely Farm 18, El Asilo, and the recently added battlezone, Shipment, which features a ton of containers and blind corners for all your hide 'n' seek needs.
Launching in October of this year, Modern Warfare II was mostly well-received by critics and fans, praising its top-tier visuals and atmosphere, while chastising the franchise's general sense of repetition even when bolstered by the power of the ninth generation of gaming. The campaign mode serves as both a reboot and a prequel to the original Modern Warfare canon, and sees Task Force 141 attempt to take down a global weapons cartel.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

We love a press release with a ton of puns, and A Little to the Left has them by the bundle. To celebrate the holiday season, the Nova Scotia-based development team Max Inferno have created a "Good Tidyings" event within the game, which comes with "a seasonal spin on normal proceedings." That seasonal spin comes in the form of six new "Yuletide disasters" that need tidying up.
Of course, those surprises are under wraps for the moment, because what kind of monster peeks at an advent calendar early? Each day, from the 22nd December to the 27th, a new, seasonal puzzle will be revealed to players of A Little to the Left, with wintry twists on the tidying puzzle mechanics of the main game.

Well, here's something we didn't think we'd be reporting on today. The popular energy drink company G-Fuel has announced that it will be releasing a special formula based on the boss character 'The Great Mighty Poo' from Conker's Bad Fur Day.
Shipping to customers in April 2023, the concoction is said to take inspiration from The Great Mighty Poo's favourite food: corn. It'll cost a rather hefty $59.99 but will also come packed with a Youtooz 'The Mighty Poo' vinyl figure (which actually looks pretty cool and we almost want one ourselves...). You can pre-order one for yourself by heading over to the G-Fuel website right now.

The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector's edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We'll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it's somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X. 
"The game is an artistic combination of action, shooting, strategy, and puzzles," the blog post reads. "The PS VR2 headset and PS…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-15T13:01:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village's VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn't just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


"A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters' journey takes full advantage of the headset's advanced features," a press release reads. "VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever."
Capcom says the platform's PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
"These [controllers] represent Ethan's famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game," Capcom writes in a press release. "Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The update includes a variety of graphical improvements to spruce up the now seven-ish year-old game to look a bit more relevant in our era of ray tracing and AI-based resolution techniques.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath's exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you've dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

And that's because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn't show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I'd argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn't a life investment, and that's rad.

I thought it had potential, but it's difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you've got to go on is footage they'd prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I'm excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe's CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

Living Large adds an unstuck button to the menu too, in case you get into peril on some geometry below the waves and can’t free yourself.

Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a'knockin... 
Whoopsie artwork isn't the only thing hiding in Crisis Core's ShinRa Mansion, though, because down in the basement is a rather cute nod a Final Fantasy VII fav. Spoilers within, obvs.

More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There's a look at Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge, Yoshi's Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood's video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can't wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood's Nintendo-themed land would be opening in "early 2023." Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

People have already taken to Twitter, Reddit, and Steam with their tales of performance woe since the update landed, with Steam reviews claiming it's caused everything from reduced frame rates to issues with the HUD. The RPS Treehouse has also been having trouble since installing the 4.0 update too, getting very inconsistent frame rates on the new max settings even with a RTX 3080 unless they turn off ray tracing and other new graphical features. Hardware editor James and vid bud Liam have more on The Witcher 3's performance woes here, but for now, here's how to avoid having the next-gen update ruin your Witcher 3 experience, and keep Roach running nice and smoothly.

Today, for example, you can pick up the 1TB model from WD's official UK web store for £75, down from £91, or the larger 2TB size for £140, down from £181. That beats the Amazon price considerably, especially for the 2TB size which is currently at £178.

The idea here is that it's more or less a 60% size mechanical keyboard, but with two useful additions: arrow keys and a numpad. This makes it about the same size as a tenkeyless keyboard, but without the (lesser-used) navigation keys. 
Combined with an asking price of £42, down from a usual price of £50, I think it's well worth considering - whether you're looking for an interesting mechanical keyboard for your growing collection (I see you there) or a first cheap mech to give the whole idea a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six months ago MPA-Canada, ACE, and Rogers Media teamed up to shut down IPTV provider SmoothStreams in Canada. The lawsuit already lists 224 records but no trial is expected anytime soon, even if it gets that far. In the meantime, photos of the service's servers and new details of the shutdown operation have appeared in a Federal Court order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

        <updated>2022-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).
It's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.

A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that's not an observation, it's an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn't see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator's post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there's a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


"I personally can't conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending," Kamiya told IGN Japan. "I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company."
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks "internally about how we could make nine of them." He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, "I'm not going to do anything that will betray the players." 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review.

A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns' stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you're playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…]]></summary>

No longer are my opponents just names on a screen: they're now names on a screen who I know have contributed to the 159 million Vibranium cards drawn during the Vibranium Forge event. It's neat to see some silly stats, even neater to see a Black Panther with a power level that tops 8 million. A normal number would be, like, 16.

Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon's Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they're treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I've played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won't pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series. After roughly two hours of playing Odyssey, I am rearing to jump back into the anime, and that’s the best compliment I can give the game. It doesn’t hurt that Odyssey is shaping u…]]></summary>

Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Basics have produced some great computer gear in their history - memorably, once selling a full-size mechanical keyboard for £23 that I reviewed and found surprisingly good value for money. Today though, it's something different: an Amazon Basics branded Micro SD card in a 256GB capacity, selling for just £15.67 rather than its UK RRP of £26.99. 
Here's what I've learned about the card, and why I reckon it's worth picking up if you're in need for a memory card for your Steam Deck, Switch or whatever.

In the past, copyright infringement was the most cited reason for action but that has been replaced by 'national security', currently a top priority for Russia. Google, however, is wary of overbroad censorship and hasn't complied with most requests.

However, today on Amazon UK the recent MX Master 2S is on sale for only £40, around a £25 reduction from its usual price point. This is a good deal for a mouse loved for its high-tech scroll wheel, wide and comfortable shape and long-ass battery life.

The Devil's Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a "wildcard condition" called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

There are decent discounts for Katharine's beloved Dorfromantik, my beloved Slipways, and many generally beloved digified board games. Most of the sales end on December 12th, so don't spend too long thinking about it. Reality's turn-timers aren't optional.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that's just my bad decisions talking. You're stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It's not super secret, but I almost don't want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

I am a chump who likes shiny things, so the release of Portal with RTX on Steam pleases me. It's free if you own Portal, but fellow chumps should be aware that it's not running too hot for everyone, with reports of crashes and literally too-hot GPUs. Ray-tracing does not come cheap.

How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children's hospital.

Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!]]></summary>

Chapter 4: Captive Freight comes out tomorrow, so it's a fine time to jump in.

At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. "Perhaps", I thought, "Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey". Even though there isn't a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey's redemption arc?

Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

She's also Zag's half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soulslike RPG The Lords Of The Fallen debuted its first gameplay trailer last night at The Game Awards, showcasing its violent combat, grotesque creature designs, and beautifully grim setting. The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it's another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom's Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative," according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it's due out sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble," Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. "Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities."
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming.

The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll "cleanse the world of its evil and corruption." 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, "It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey." Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, "Should we have connected," casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other "visual" works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.]]></summary>

The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here's what he said: 
"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast."
It's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-09T01:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?"


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
