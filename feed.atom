Veteran video game writer Mary DeMarle has confirmed that they will be joining BioWare in order to pen the narrative for the next entry in the epic and much-beloved sci-fi franchise, Mass Effect. Game Director Michael Gamble confirmed the signing on social media yesterday.
"Oh, hey! I’m really excited to let you know that Mary DeMarle will be joining the Mass Effect team as Senior Narrative Director," wrote Gamble on Twitter. "You’ve seen her work in Guardians of the Galaxy & Deus Ex (to name a few!). She’s amazing."
https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1544057781619044353?s=20&t=XtimLuMwQbWu1roJUmzFyQ
As noted by Gamble, DeMarle is no stranger to epic, dramatic, and operatic storytelling, having penned the excellent Deus Ex games for Crystal Dynamics, and the recent comic-book adventure Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. These are both titles that deal with group dynamics, friendship, politics, technology, moral turbulence, and character-based comedy — all traits that make up the emotive space opera universe of Mass Effect.
DeMarle's new role at BioWare follows their leaving Eidos Montreal in the wake of the Embracer Group purchase. With a resume of stone-cold narrative classics, and multiple awards to their name, DeMarle is a valuable, prestigious, and highly sought-after writer. No doubt their talent for engrossing, compelling, and, most importantly, immersive storytelling will be a major ace in "Mass Effect 4's" sleeve. Mass Effect is its story — it always has been — and it's comforting to know that the next chapter is in safe hands.
The next chapter of Mass Effect is currently in development at BioWare.

The Fallout 76 content drops seemingly never end, which is...a good thing for folks who bought it and always wanted the game to improve. The next one involves a new Fallout 76 PTS period, which will add content to the live version "later this summer." It's more stuff for The Pitt!
Through the PTS you can partake in the "From Ashes to Fire" mission, as well as any quality of life upgrades and fixes that are part of the new build (a "new round of bug fixes" is already confirmed). To diffuse the confusion, The Pitt expeditions are already part of the game currently, as you'll be able to go on little micro-quests there — but a bigger expansion is also coming eventually.
As a reminder, the Fallout 76 PTS has now fully moved to Steam at this point in Fallout 76‘s lifecycle, and is no longer tethered to the Bethesda Launcher in any shape or form. For more details on how to migrate all that over to Steam, read this article. Bethesda also keeps a running log of recent PTS updates, which patch notes, improvements, and fixes to boot. You can find that log here, just remember that it's going to shift depending on feedback.

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

The pirating world of Skull and Bones is re-emerging. Ubisoft is hosting a worldwide gameplay reveal on July 7, showcasing a new look at the seafaring multiplayer game.
This isn't quite the first-ever reveal of Skull and Bones footage. We've seen a few gameplay looks in the past, dating back several years. But Ubisoft's pirate game has been quiet for quite a while, resurfacing here and there in financial statements and reports.
On July 7 at 11 a.m. PT, Ubisoft will get a chance at making a new impression for Skull and Bones. The pre-show will start at 10:45 a.m. PT, followed by new gameplay and a behind-the-scenes with the developers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_c7F4PHzcc
For plunder and fortune
There was a supposedly leaked gameplay video not long ago, showcasing what Ubisoft's Skull and Bones currently looks like. The video, as a sort-of tutorial for various game mechanics, showed resource collecting, management, and sailing the high seas looking for combat with other ships.
At the time, the official account shared a video, asking fans to keep their eyes on the horizon. Seems like it's time for the official re-reveal later this week.
Ubisoft has also locked in a new multi-game showcase later this year on September 10, at 12 p.m. PT. While this week's spotlight will focus on Skull and Bones, the upcoming September showcase will feature updates and news on multiple projects from Ubisoft's teams around the world. Considering that Ubisoft has many projects in development, ranging from a new Avatar game and Beyond Good & Evil 2 to XDefiant and Project Q, expect just about anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have to stress: the original
Warcraft III turns 20 years old this week: just let that sink in. The strategy classic originally arrived on July 3, 2002, and changed the genre (and eventually, other subgenres) forever.
I can vividly recall when Warcraft III came out, as a friend of mine took off school for several days, and declined to hang out with my gaming group that weekend in favor of playing through the entire campaign. That act of isolation ensorcelled me into running out and buying it, and once we had a LAN setup going at his house, the rest was history. By then Warcraft III had fully caught on in the zeitgeist, and was on its way to becoming one of the most popular strategy games of all time.
Before long, we were playing hundreds of hours of custom games. Entire weekends were spent (with Diablo 2 hell mode breaks) trying to find the best custom games possible, and we'd all go out in these little individual excursion missions downloading them before taking turns presenting the group with the coolest, most-lasting maps to play. Eventually, someone found DOTA, and that turned into its own game (and genre) — but you know that story!
Years later, when we met my wife, one of the first things we did was surf custom games together (lots of tower defense!). It's been a unifying element throughout my entire life as long as it has existed.
All of the above is why it's such a shame that Reforged replaced the original client going forward. While the re-release did finally get an update recently, it's not only too little too late, but it's not enough. Hopefully if Blizzard hasn't gotten around to it but the time Microsoft takes over, the new owners will make it right. If all else fails, just de-couple Reforged entirely: the classic version of the game deserves to live on beyond file sharing.

A little while ago we covered the incredible work of @SpinaSanctuary and their Zelda 64-inspired, low-poly Star Trek creations. The last batch focused on the crew of the USS Enterprise from Star Trek: The Next Generation, rendering them in brilliantly blocky 64-bit form with a variety of instruments — Data with his violin, Riker with his trombone, and Picard with his Ressikan flute.
Now the artist has moved onto Deep Space Nine, the darker 'underdog' series in the Star Trek stable that (much like Majora's Mask, in fact) is all the cool kids' favourite these days. That's not a slight — it really is very good! — but it's certainly taken longer for the wider Trek audience to embrace DS9 to its collective bosom with the same gusto TNG enjoyed during its run in the '90s.

Developer Dreamloop Games and publisher Aksys are teaming up for a new social thriller. Inescapable is a new adventure game, directly inspired by Danganronpa, about how far some might go for cash and clout.
Described as a social thriller / ontological mystery game, Inescapable was revealed over the weekend as part of Aksys Games' Anime Expo 2022 panel. It seems to wear its inspiration on its sleeve, though it has a few twists of its own.
Inescapable follows Harrison, one of 11 contestants who are kidnapped and made to take part in a reality TV show. At the end of their stay, the contestants get $500,000. But there are no rules, and no escape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZIuIlh0dlc
No way home
It seems likely that, given time, some suspicion and murder might begin to take place. Much of it seems to be about mistrust, so I'm curious what the motivation would be to turn these contestants on each other.
Considering the last Danganronpa game (or at least the last mystery-focused one) was in 2017, I'm intrigued by what's being put together here. It's got similar vibes to the second Danganronpa and its summer vacation setting, with some style all its own. I dig the plastic standees used in the world here, for example.

So far, we've just seen some dialogue windows and cutscenes. I'm curious what the actual mystery and, if inspired by Danganronpa, murder side of Inescapable looks like.
Dreamloop has been steadily building up work though, partnering for technical support on several games. Its last collaboration with Aksys was on 2018's Switch release of Stardust Galaxy Warriors: Stellar Climax.
Now, it's tackling the thriller and suspicion of an island vacation gone awry. We'll see how it comes together when Inescapable launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Importing and the collector's edition (for one out of three figures) are two of the only options at the moment
Right now the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo hunt continues to be a mystery in the US, with no retailer sightings beyond the collector's edition: which comes with the lone Malzeno figure.
The others (the Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico) are nowhere to be found in the region.
Here's a quick recap of how the Sunbreak amiibo situation is going worldwide:
You can pre-order them now on Play-Asia or Amazon Japan, but they'll be shipping in late September/August depending on the retailer: some users are reporting that Play-Asia is canceling select pre-orders
Some UK/EU regions are reporting that they are available at retail, and are all out now with the release of Sunbreak itself
Again, the US release is a complete mystery outside of the Malzeno figure being locked to the collector's edition. As the Amiibo News Twitter account points out, the US site removed the amiibo category altogether. The current guess is that they'll be GameStop releases, with no open pre-order period: but having spoken to multiple GameStops in my region, they are not listed in the system yet, and managers have no idea when they might arrive. If they do come to GameStop, it could be a free-for-all "order in store" situation.
As usual, if you're a collector, consider importing! Given the current global supply chain issues they might end up becoming a rare little trio: or, things could smooth over and there could be plenty of stock. Even before 2020, it was always a gamble when it comes to amiibo.
[Update: A Twitter reader has pointed out to Destructoid that there are CPSIA ratings for English release figures (Malzeno, Palamute, Palico), which provides some hope.]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Rough Deal
One of our favorite spoilers, the Australian Classification ratings board, has updated its website with a new PlayStation listing for Daniel Mullins Games' deck-builder Inscryption, suggesting that the spooky roguelike card game is headed to PS4 in the very near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPBP3kWDcNk
Released on PC in the fall of 2021, Inscryption turned plenty of heads in double-quick time with its incredibly creepy and disturbing aesthetic, compelling strategy gameplay, and fascinating "found footage" framing device. The indie hit would go on to feature in many Best of Year lists, even winning the Game of the Year award at the prestigious Game Developers Choice Award and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Awards.
While the title is yet to receive an announcement of any such port, this new rating all but confirms that Inscryption is headed to the console market. While this rating is strictly for PlayStation platforms, it is difficult to imagine that publisher Devolver Digital will not also be looking to release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. We will be sure to give you a heads up when official confirmation is forthcoming.
Inscryption is available now on PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

He touched briefly on his upcoming projects (yes, plural projects) and was happy to report that the game likely to come out first – Haunted Chocolatier – is a solo endeavor. Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

We really miss physical game manuals. There was always a particular kind of joy that came from opening the box of a brand new video game and flicking through the pages of a manual to find out what the game was going to be like. Some of our favourites would get dog-eared, and torn up, but they were always well-loved by us!
One Twitch streamer and archivist understands the joy and importance of old video game manuals and has gone out of their way to archive every single Super Nintendo manual in English online, VGC has reported. Peebs, an SNES streamer-turned archivist, realised through streaming that there wasn't a one-stop shop for SNES fans to find all of their favourite manuals that they might be missing. So they embarked on a long, eight-year quest to find every single manual and get it archived online for everyone to see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current figure includes shipments and digital sales
Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion just hit two million in sales (with Rise reaching the 10-million-sales milestone), and to celebrate, a free Sunbreak gift is on the way on July 7 (in the form of "two item packs").
The news comes straight from Capcom's own site, where the publisher gloats a bit about how far the franchise has come as a whole:
"Beginning with the first title in 2004, the series established a new genre in which players cooperate to hunt ferocious monsters with their friends and has since grown into a global phenomenon with cumulative sales of the series exceeding 84 million units shipped as of July 5, 2022."

As a recap, currently, Monster Hunter Rise is soundly in the top five all-time sales list for Capcom, with the old figure of nine million units sold. If the 10 million mark fully clears and the site is updated, it'll surpass Resident Evil 2 and sit just below Resident Evil 7 (10.80 million units) in third place. From there, it likely will beat out RE7, then it'll have to take on Monster Hunter World's 21 million units (previously 18 million, before today's figure) to supplant the top spot.

The game's creative director was none other than Suda51 of No More Heroes fame. Lollipop Chainsaw is also the first and only game that Guardians of the Galaxy film director James Gunn has ever written for. While it's not clear that Grasshopper Manufacture is returning to develop the remake, we're still confident!

It's a puzzle-o-rama firing up a mysterious old computer to download pirated software from a BBS, letting us play everything from logic puzzles of circuits and flesh to a model kit-building simulation. I've played a wee bit and am keen to explore more, even as someone who is the absolute worst at Zachlikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long, suckers
Following last month's surprisingly under-the-radar teaser, Dragami Games has confirmed that it is currently working on a remake of the hyper-silly, hyper-violent hack 'n' slash hit Lollipop Chainsaw. The remake is scheduled to launch next year, though specific platforms are yet to be revealed.
In an article on Japanese website Automaton, Dragami Games' CEO Yoshimi Yasuda spoke of not his own fondness for the series, but his awareness of its dedicated cult following. As such, Yasuda thought it was apt to revisit the 2012 release for its tenth anniversary (which is this year, strictly speaking). For such a niche release, it appears that Dragami has faced a considerable amount of red tape in bringing the project to fruition.
"It has been some time since players have not been able to access the game on current consoles. We, the original development staff on Lollipop Chainsaw, think of the game as very precious to us, and did not want to leave it in limbo, where players who want to play it cannot," notes Yasuda. "As such, we purchased the Lollipop Chainsaw intellectual property from Kadokawa Games and decided to develop a remake. We have already contacted Warner Bros. about development and are being supported by them in this endeavor."
Yasuda notes that many of the original game's development team will be returning to work on the remake, which is expected to have a somewhat more "realistic" aesthetic due to the nature of modern gaming hardware. It is also lamented that, unfortunately, much of the original release's soundtrack will be omitted for licensing reasons, so players so expect a brand new score "aside from a few licensed tracks."
Lollipop Chainsaw is currently in development at Dragami Games. It is scheduled to launch in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoom and enhance… Yuck! Zoom out!
Cyberpunk is an inherently old-fashioned genre. Its iconic works draw on futuristic ideas that have either become unremarkable, like essential spheres of life based on tech owned by megalomaniacal corporations, or been superseded, like an obsession with cybernetic enhancements instead of codified social status. Video games, though, are somewhere these concepts have played out vividly. So an old-fashioned video game about a cyberpunk classic is something that makes sense.
In its own little way, Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is a perfectly authentic nugget of the genre. However, in this cyberpunk story, we players are the neon-mohawked, robot-armed gutter-sludge gang-grunts trampled down by the money-sucking Big Business Corp (here played by Nightdive Studios), and Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is one of the pellets of barely nutritional crud said Corp scatters into the storm drains for us to stay just alive enough that we can be leeched of blood to lubricate the cyborgs that drive the pellet-scattering hover trucks. It’s kippleware – software detritus that has come about spontaneously in the current epidemic of remake/remaster/rerelease/re-profit.

Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder," he says.

So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.
For now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, that's a shame.
Rumours have been swirling for quite some time regarding a potential remaster for Red Dead Redemption. The game originally launched over twelve years ago on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and followed the exploits of ex-outlaw John Marston as he hunts down his former gang members. The sequel, launched in 2018, showcased John's gang during its glory years and ties closely into the events of the first game. As such, fans have been clamouring for a rerelease of Red Dead Redemption to bring it more in line with modern gameplay and visuals.
Back in 2021, our sister site Push Square reported that a remaster of Red Dead Redemption was being planned, but its release could depend on the success of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy: The Definitive Edition. Launched on Switch and other platforms last year, the remastered trilogy sold well, shipping over 10 million copies, but was severely criticised by the media and players alike for its shoddy visuals and multiple bugs at launch.

It seems the game has also proved to be a commercial success, as Capcom has announced that the expansion has already surpassed 2 million shipments worldwide for Switch and PC. In addition, it states that the main Monster Hunter Rise game has reached an astounding 10 million units shipped. As for the franchise as a whole, the Monster Hunter series has now reached cumulative sales of over 84 million worldwide, although a significant chunk of this can be attributed to Monster Hunter World, which achieved an all-time record for Capcom of 21 million units shipped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthias Clasen z Red Hatu založil v projektu GTK návrh zvážit, zdali by GTK5 nemělo přijít na svět už bez podpory X11. Komentuje to jednoduše: situace s X11 se nijak nelepší a Wayland je již široce podporován. Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.]]></summary>

Nintendo has arguably been one of the biggest victims of video game industry leaks - with inncidents like the 'Gigaleak' revealing years of company secrets across multiple generations - including concepts, prototypes and even cancelled projects.
It's obviously not the best look when security and data is breached, and during the recent shareholder meeting, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa was questioned about what kind of "risk-management initiatives" the company was taking to deal with information leaks and hacks.

Throughout the lifespan of the Nintendo Switch, there have been a number of "impossible" ports released. We're talking games like The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt and the new version of DOOM, developed by specialist teams such as Saber Interactive and Panic Button.
One other developer who is also known to work miracles on Nintendo's hybrid system is Virtuos. Since the arrival of the Switch, it's helped bring games like Dying Light, L.A. Noire, Dark Souls: Remastered and Bioshock: The Collection to the device. Now, in the latest news, it's been revealed the same company is behind the NieR:Automata Switch release (originally developed by PlatinumGames).

Netflix just posted the intro to the upcoming Cyberpunk anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and it's got a Franz Ferdinand track over the top - but hey, it's still pretty good.

SGDQ, or Summer Games Done Quick, is a speedrunning charity fundraising marathon that wrapped up last weekend with a total of over $3 million raised for Doctors Without Borders. It included a run of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, a tense relay race in Super Mario Maker 2, and an absolutely nuts 30-minute run of Elden Ring as the finale.
But every year, there's always one run that rises above the rest — and, admittedly, it's usually a Zelda game, for whatever reason. This year, it was Ocarina of Time... or, it was sort of Ocarina of Time. Let us explain.

It’s 1 AM and you have just spent the past 12 hours replaying the same segment of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In your mind, there is no stopping until perfection is achieved – or the more likely option – you pass out from sleep deprivation. For the next few weeks, you continue to hone your skills, in the hope of reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a full run of the game. Meanwhile, you are in a race with a massive community of like-minded individuals, each with their own strategies and goals in mind. Welcome to the world of speedrunning.
Since its release in 2017, Breath of the Wild has been featured in several speedrun categories, with the most popular being Any%, where players attempt to defeat the final boss and complete the game as quickly as possible. Despite the longevity of the main adventure during a casual playthrough, BOTW can now be beaten in less than 30 minutes, with the world record currently sitting at 24:10 by a runner named Koroks. To understand the work that goes into running this huge game, we spoke with Koroks about that astonishing world record run, and life as a speedrunner.

The company wanted to gather a group of experienced but still-passionate developers, all focused on the idea of creating something ambitious despite the studio’s smaller size. The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.
Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is the latest entry in Nintendo and Koei Tecmo’s Warriors series, which spans The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem. Like Hyrule Warriors, which received a Breath of the Wild-specific sequel in Age of Calamity, this new Warriors game is set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe. Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review. 
I interviewed Nintendo Co. Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes.

It's happening, alright. Polium, a Web 3 company (Web 3 is an idea of a new version of the internet that we know today, with a form distributed in the blockchain) has revealed the very first NFT video game console this weekend.
Called the Polium One, this little black box is meant to be "a multi-chain console for Web 3 gaming" and will have both existing and exclusive games on the system when it launches sometime in 2024. And while the console has drawn some criticism online, some of you eagle-eyed Twitter users have spotted some similarities between Polium's logo and a certain Nintendo console's own.

And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I've gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls.

Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans.

I can confirm it's really good! A lovely point and click mystery with some tricksy puzzles, but unlimited goes so you still get to feel clever - plus the story plays with some mystery tropes in really fun ways. But the real joy is its characters. It's a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.

Metal Max has largely stayed in Japan, outside of Xeno and its Reborn cousin. We got Metal Saga on PS2, but that went by without much notice.

I když zbytek světa má okurkovou sezónu, v technice se stále něco děje a jako vždy pro vás máme připravenou spoustu novinek a zajímavých témat. Ptáte se, co konkrétně? Určitě si něco povíme o chystaném Raspberry Pi Pico W s přidanou Wi-Fi. Ze světa hardwaru nesmí chybět ani šílenosti jako 100n kondenzátory pro použití do 30 GHz nebo 10n do 110 GHz a kde je koupit. Ze světa obskurit třeba novou edici 25 let starých grafických karet Voodoo 5 6000 nebo “kutilský life hack”, který jenom v USA už stál nejméně 34 životů.

Pokud by Vám nestačila tato témata, bude samozřejmě probíhat po celou dobu volná diskuze v klasickém punkově-chaotickém stylu, který je nám vlastní a díky kterému není VB suchopárná konference, ale pravá hospodská diskuze, kde může proletět i virtuální půllitr.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 4. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

There are a lot of video games out there in the world. Shooters, platformers, narrative adventures, fighting games — iconic genres that have almost forty years of precedence to make them what they are today. Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there's anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design. The industry has plenty of answers for keeping things moving forward, but my absolute favorite trend in games right now is genre mashup.

When I was growing up, the sounds of sports were always all over our house. My dad likes pretty much every sport imaginable, from football to baseball to track and field. A lot of the time I had no idea what was going on, but having a game on in the background made for the perfect backing track to take my Sunday afternoon naps. Sometimes when I want to feel extra cozy, I'll find an old NFL game on YouTube to put on while I fall asleep.
These days, the closest thing I get to watching sports is esports. It's an entirely different world, as I've learned from my friends who work on that side of the industry, but there's also a lot of crossover there.

It's fair to say that The Lord of the Rings (and by extension, The Legendarium, a catch-all term that covers J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth works) is a huge part of my life. I'm writing this now listening to the soundtrack of the Peter Jackson trilogy, after having come back from a four-player session of The Lord of the Rings LCG co-op card game. Oh, and I went to a Tolkien-related academic conference this past weekend: Mythmoot 2022.
It was there that I caught up with Dr. Corey Olsen, The Tolkien Professor (more on that peculiar emphasis in a moment) to talk about his involvement with the Return to Moria game, as well as some thoughts on the upcoming Gollum project.
For hardcore Tolkien fans, Dr. Olsen needs no introduction. Bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can't you take a Yoke?
Still on its Namco kick, the retro fun factory that is Hamster Corporation is offering up something a little special for this week's release, as the under-the-radar but surprisingly groundbreaking Thunder Ceptor is available to download right now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released to the arcade market in the summer of 1986, Thunder Ceptor is an into-the-screen rail shooter with shmup elements and a hyper-futuristic aesthetic. Developed and released by Namco as something as an answer to smash hit Space Harrier, the game features the fast-paced, into-the-screen shmup action as the Sega classic, complete with dazzling colors and incredibly fast-paced galactic gameplay. Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber SidRetron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4nRyFUNJA
At the time, Thunder Ceptor was by far Namco's most technically advanced and resource-heavy release yet, and is also the first-ever video game to feature a 360-degree yoke controller. Like Space Harrier, Namco's offering also boasted an impressive sit-in arcade cabinet. Not content with this all this extravagance, Namco would offer up revamp-cum-sequel 3D Thunder Ceptor II later that same year, which added stereoscopic 3D visuals to allow for further immersion and/or headaches.
Surprisingly, however, Thunder Ceptor has not seen the same level of celebration as many of Namco's other releases, having been frequently left off of multiple retro compilations, leaving the 3D shmup to fall between the cracks of the company's long-term history. While not as slick or as polished as its inspiration, the pretender still brought a few cool tricks to the arcade dance hall, and its resurrection through the Arcade Archives range has been a long time coming.
Thunder Ceptor is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patch 8 looms on the horizon
Larian Studios has another update on the way for its ongoing early access RPG Baldur's Gate 3. A new Panel From Hell is on the way, unveiling the also-incoming Patch 8 for Baldur's Gate 3.
The next Panel From Hell, Larian's regular showcase for new Baldur's Gate 3 content, will air on July 7 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. You can follow the countdown and site here, or keep an eye on Larian's Twitch channel. The company rented out a theatre in Ghent for the occasion, so expect at least a little bit of pageantry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uqvdsgzO8U
Panels From Hell usually coincide with new patches for Baldur's Gate 3, and this one seems no different. Larian posted a PSA today for the upcoming Patch 8, confirming that this update will indeed render old saves incompatible. The team is keeping beta branches up so players can keep running their old files if they'd like, though with this new update, Larian will only keep the two most recent patches active. This means Patch 6 and 7, alongside the incoming Patch 8. You can find easy-to-follow instructions on opting into beta branches here.
A hefty update
Previous patches have added everything from new story content and areas to explore to new classes, though there's not much of a hint what'll happen in Patch 8.
What we do know is that it will be a fairly hefty update, file size-wise. Larian's post says this update will be roughly 40 GB, bringing the total file size of Baldur's Gate 3 up to 104 GB of storage space.
Whatever is on the way, I'm down for more. Larian has been up-front in saying that 2023 is its target for leaving Early Access, and I'm eager to see what it's building up to for the full game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team started building Fire Emblem Warriors 2, then pivoted
According to a new interview via Nintendo Dream magazine (translated by Nintendo Everything), the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes team had a different idea in mind for the follow-up to the original.
This notion is straight from the production team (including producers Yosuke Hayashi and Hideo Suzuki), who stated that they had helped work on Three Houses with Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, right after Fire Emblem Warriors development ended. After that lengthy and fruitful partnership between the three entities, they proposed a direct sequel for FE Warriors.
Hayashi recalls that it was originally titled "Fire Emblem Warriors 2," but everything pivoted when the concept of slotting the game into the Three Houses universe came to light. The decision was a no-brainer because of the "good reception and the setting," which made it an obvious choice for a sequel. The collective says it was "what the audience would want the most," and I think they nailed it!
Suzuki also muses a bit on how it all came to pass, and the decision to downplay other parts of Fire Emblem history was made to focus entirely on Three Houses:
"It ended up as the phantom proposal (laughs). The direction may have changed, but we’re fans of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, so we were more glad than anything to have the opportunity to create a Warriors title in that setting."

To put it bluntly: good! The first Fire Emblem Warriors didn't really have the same oomph, as it attempted to juggle a lot. The storyline wasn't nearly as cohesive as it could have been, and the idea to tackle a parallel universe with Three Hopes was a smart plan. It helps differentiate the original Switch strategy game completely, while providing a new take on the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NieR: Automata Switch is 720p in portable mode
We have confirmation of NieR: Automata Switch specs and things are looking good!
Announced very plainly on Twitter thanks to the NieR Japan account, Square Enix states that the resolution for docked/TV mode is 1920x1080p, with concessions for 1280x720p in tabletop/portable mode. They also clearly state the framerate: 30FPS. Well, that's pretty cut and dried!
This is important to note, as the account is tweeting out new details in regards to the Switch port of the game, following the reveal in the Nintendo Direct Mini. Some folks were noting that the Square Enix site stated a "60 FPS" framerate, but that figure seems to be copied and pasted from the Yorha Edition specs on other platforms. We've reached out for clarification on the matter, but until then we're confident that 30 FPS is the target for Switch.
As a reminder, NieR Automata is out on October 6 on the Switch platform. Thankfully, it will not be a cloud-based nonsense release! Take that Kingdom Hearts. While the jury is out on how stable the game actually is in the end, it looks like Square Enix is perfectly capable of putting out non-cloud ports. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Switch and not an outlier.

Hey there! I was going to be playing MADiSON today, a brand new horror game akin to Visage, as I heard it was released last weekend. Turns out it's been pushed til next weekend (hopefully) so today I’m pivoting to... Dark Souls II. I've always said I put it on pause for a rainy day, and today is that day, both metaphorically and literally.

The controls were the hardest part last time I played a few years ago, but I was also a noob. I’m definitely a pro and definitely ready for this now. See you tonight!

It has taken a while for Nintendo Switch Online to get here with its small-batch, subscription-based rollout, but the Sega Genesis lineup is starting to come into its own. Whereas the N64 additions for Switch Online + Expansion Pack have been solo drops, Sega fans get a few Genesis games at a time, and this week's lineup is surprisingly good.
As of June 30, Expansion Pack subscribers can play Comix Zone, Mega Man: The Wily Wars, Target Earth, and Zero Wing on Nintendo Switch. So what'll it be? Pain or pleasure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Extreme" US posters are so great
So I missed the Sonic 2 angry Tails movie poster, and I especially missed that the Japanese version had a more lighthearted happier one. While these types of changes are fairly common, it doesn't make it any less funny. Over on Twitter, user whisperwolf brought it to my attention, spotting the differences that I'm sure a lot of folks had already seen.
Then the comparisons started coming in, calling it a "Kirby moment," a classic example of a character that gets more lighthearted or serious depending on the region:
https://twitter.com/whisperwoIf/status/1542173257415147522
Another person reminds us of another Sonic 2 angry Tails makeover. The Ristar animation changes, which took the Ristar "serious" boss battle face and plastered it across the entire US version:
https://twitter.com/GnMarxide/status/1542296307854966785
For this particular case, Japan got it right. Tails, by nature, is a free spirit. You can see this trait in pretty much everything he's in, from Sonic 2 to the Sonic Boom TV show. Every so often Tails can get down to it and save the day (especially when he needs to step up after a Sonic absence), but his kind heart is what sets him apart from the otherwise stoic and wisecracking cast of friends.
Bet you didn't expect a Tails character breakdown this weekend eh? Well, as I've mentioned elsewhere, it's been kind of a rocky week, and my kid and I have been watching a lot of Sonic Boom together!

Disco Elysium is one of my favorite games of all time. I love recommending it to anyone who will listen, but something I forget is just how text-heavy that game is. I'm an avid reader, but for others, the game's script, which clocks in at over a million words, can be pretty intimidating. The good news is, though, that the developers at ZA/UM are well aware of this fact, and have made a bunch of great changes since the game has come out to help make the game accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. Disco Elysium: The Final Cut introduced a fully-voiced experience, but the newest addition is yesterday's free update that added dyslexia-friendly fonts.
The font used for most languages is called OpenDyslexic, which was designed to mitigate common reading mistakes that those with dyslexia can make. The great thing is that the font's creators made it open source, so that anyone can use it if needed.
In Disco Elysium specifically, OpenDyslexic is used for the English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese-Brazilian, and Polish versions of the game. Other languages have also been accounted for — the Korean version uses a font called Nanum Square Round, while the Russian version uses Adys.
ZA/UM also stated that they're still investigating options for both traditional and simplified Chinese.

The devs shared their thoughts in Steam blog post that announced the update: "It’s important, especially for a game with over a million words, that we continue to make improvements to ensure everyone can have the best user experience during their time in Revachol."
It's great to see yet another studio taking down as many barriers to entry as they can -- it feels like the games space is only becoming a more thoughtful and considerate space (for the most part).
The dyslexia-friendly font update is available to download now, wherever you can play Disco Elysium.

If you wanted a quick recap of the Nintendo Direct Mini announcements, we already gave you one! But life is often a visual medium, and we have the solution right here.
Bam!
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1542870646945976321
To recap, here are a few choice Nintendo Direct Mini announcements:
Persona games coming to Switch
A NieR: Automata port that isn't cloud nonsense
The Mega Man Battle Network series lives on again in 2023
In all, it was a pretty fun little Nintendo Direct Mini. A little stressful, I might add, because it all dropped at once with a giant VOD, but once we all got through it together and figured out what was actually new, it was fine. In fact, it was straight-up better and more justified in its existence than a lot of other "Summer of Gaming" streams. Leave it to Nintendo to just casually drive through without a big first-party stream even and crush some of the competition.
I have to admit though, the way Microsoft dropped that conference on us this summer and said "everything announced here is coming out within a year" was pretty baller. A select few of these Switch announcements are likely a ways out, and the "to be released in the future" notations for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are worrying in particular!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing Sly going on here
Today, Sucker Punch Productions published a message about its 25 years of games. In the process, it also confirms that no, it's not working on a new inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper game.
Sucker Punch says in its message that as its games continue to grow, they require the full attention of the studio. And being that it's currently focusing on one project, the studio says it's not working on any other one of its properties.
"As our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require the full attention of our studio. With our focus on our current project, we have no plans to revisit inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper right now, and no other studio is currently working on projects related to those franchises either. These characters are very special and near and dear to our hearts, so while we’d never say never to re-opening those doors down the road, for now there are no inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper games in development."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlNfJvFnzc8
An inFAMOUS legacy
That pretty much settles that. Sucker Punch does go on to confirm its performing maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC servers, to keep them running a bit longer. They will eventually be sunset, but Sucker Punch says it wants to keep them running "for as long as possible" for players who still want to dip in. The Cole's Legacy DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son will also be put up on the PlayStation Store in all territories soon.
It's a bit of a strange announcement, though there have been rumors in the past of a return to Sly Cooper revival and the like. This just seems like Sucker Punch getting out ahead of that, as it works on something it says is unrelated to inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper. Sorry to all the fans of thieving animals.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/01/new-cult-of-the-lamb-trailer-highlights-best-practices-for-keeping-your-cult-happy"/>
        <updated>2022-07-01T18:59:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

I've nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's less than a week until Amazon Prime Day 2022, the annual opportunity for PC hardware fans to contribute towards Jeff Bezos' next Jeff Bezos-shaped space rocket. At least you'll get some good, cheap kit in return, and there are already enough sales knocking about for a roundup of the best early Prime Day PC gaming deals.
The nice thing about these is that, unlike the deals that launch on Prime Day itself (July 12-13th), you won't need an Amazon Prime account to take advantage of them. In fact, many of them aren't on Amazon at all - while Amazon’s Prime Day landing page is up and already pointing to various discounts, rival retailers have some price-matched or even better savings as well.

Announced earlier this week as part of the game's 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone's hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that's not exactly ideal.

What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …]]></summary>

Satisfying the long term fans while keeping things approachable for newcomers on top of, well, making a good game. Add in the complexities of making a turn-based game based on an existing turn-based game and it’s surprising that developers don’t just collapse into gibbering, tentacle-waving Chaos Spawn.


Complex Games, the developers of recent XCOM-like Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters not only managed to resist the mutating power of the Warp, but produced an absolute cracker of a game. Suspecting pacts with Dark Powers were behind it, I put on my big Inquisitorial hat and set off to question Noah Decter-Jackson, the game’s Creative Director.

The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there's a fair bit of overlap with the series' established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that's been on the fandom's collective wish list for a very long time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a "punker granny" or a "famous streamer" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.]]></summary>

Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll soon have the chance to play EA's highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this "insider" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title "Still working on it." The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it's going to be a blast.]]></summary>

There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

June 30, 2022
In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, "You will die here, and I will live forever." We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, "Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else."
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

You can read more about the June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup here.

Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)
Arcadegeddon (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
While waiting for these games to go live, be sure to download last month’s games – God of War, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl – and then read about the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service to find out which new tier is right for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I've started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I've played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you'll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it's done ours. I'll warn you now, though. It's a big list.

It's a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it's only an hour or two to complete.

All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn't going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, "How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?" To which I responded, "Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now." Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.]]></summary>

2017's Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game's associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle's success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

So, I sat down with the game's creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a "true adventure".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

        <updated>2022-06-29T11:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel's Avengers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.]]></summary>

And that was the extent of our knowledge at the time. Well, thanks to Nintendo's latest Direct Mini, we got the briefest slice of new gameplay which expands our knowledge just a smidge further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers' exploration-heavy gameplay. 
As seen during today's Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears. You can obtain these gears by solving puzzles and comp…]]></summary>

While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today's Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed that we'll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.
Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.]]></summary>

This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you're exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild's paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it's worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level.

The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world's final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier's classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it's been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White

Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don't know much else about what appears to be an "ultimate" or "game of the year" edition of the title, but the game's inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy.

The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn't stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn't ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we'd like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn't a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it's 2005, baby, and they struggled. I'm okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn't have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

Lots of things with no end, basically. It's also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon's core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Bob vs. The Replicons is an ambitious 2D game about flying your spaceship onto a procedurally generated planet surface, gathering resources and tethering them to your ship, then blasting back into orbit to explore more of outerspace. There's a new trailer for it below, but it's not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.

Xbox Game Pass now helps me in my tests by, eventually, adding each iteration, and FIFA 22 is now available through the subscription service as part of June's haul of new games.

Also added this past week: the Shadowrun Trilogy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Naraka: Bladepoint. And Far Cry 5 will arrive on July 1st.

If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam... Until earlier today, when Blade Runner Classic was added to the Steam version, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I'm honest. Even the ones I've enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren't the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it's precisely because it's not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It's not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it's all the more faithful for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I'm willing to bet that "pluviophile" would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.

What I wasn't expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game's reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let's investigate.

The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.

Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as "complicated" or "simple". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.
