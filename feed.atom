The year was 2014 and Nintendo was in one of the worst financial pickles that the company had ever seen thanks to the poor sales of the Wii U. You might think that this was no time for joviality, but this is Nintendo that we are talking about, and Miyamoto had other ideas.
Taking his favourite child, Pikmin, the legendary game designer announced that he was working on a series of short films that would help to promote the series' third entry, Pikmin 3, which had released the year prior.

40 years ago today, video game history changed for the better.
That might sound a bit hyperbolic, but there's no denying that Nintendo's first home console — or at least the first one with interchangeable cartridges in a form we still recognise as a 'console' today — made a huge impact. Video games would not be where they would be today without this little white and red unit.

When Limited Run Games announced that Gex would return to modern gaming platforms, I decided to revisit the lizard’s debut adventure. I had no idea what I was getting into.
For the uninitiated, Gex is a mascot platformer released by Crystal Dynamics in 1995. It was originally developed for the 3DO console, a wildly expensive piece of hardware that, adjusted for inflation, cost around half a month’s rent in New York City. Naturally, this is how I first played Gex. Being in elementary school at the time, the only 3DO games that really appealed to me were Gex and Soccer Kid. All I remember about Soccer Kid is that there’s an enemy that says “get awf my laaaaaand,” which I found funny.

Capcom's new team-based competitive shooter Exoprimal is out, and well, it's a bit of an oddball. It's got guns, mechs, and it's all about whittling down the dino horde. And while it's still early on in this game's lifespan, we have a few tips for making life in Exoprimal easier.
Keep in mind, Exoprimal is a relatively full price ($59.99)  game, with additional progression and add-ons for extra cash. I don't personally recommend dumping that kind of cash unless you just want to fast-track through the suits. Some of the early suits you get will tide you over well to the later ones, and most of Exoprimal is about efficiency in PvE, though you will have to fight a player from time to time.

Exoprimal seemed to drift on and off my radar leading up to its launch. It was the game that would show up on a stream, I'd gleefully take in all the cheesiness of a mech-powered dino-horde defense shooter, and move on. Even after playing the beta, Exoprimal didn't leave too much of a lasting impression.
So maybe that's why, as I spend today playing the launch version of Exoprimal, I'm a bit surprised by how much I'm enjoying the experience. It's not taking my breath away, but it's not boring either. Exoprimal is pretty okay. And yes, part of that is because it's a game about piloting a mech suit against a horde of otherworldly dinosaurs. It's fun for a squad, but it's got an asterisk or two on it.

All that for £175 - not bad, right? 
To get this price, you'll need to sign up for Dell's newsletter to get a 5% off code, then use it with another code - TELEGRAPH5MON - at the checkout. That brings this £259 monitor down to £175, complete with a three-year warranty and free delivery.

There's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common "what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for".
Protagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.

Firefly Studios is celebrating the twenty-year legacy of the Stronghold series with an all-new Definitive Edition of the original game. Stronghold: Definitive Edition is updating the two-decade-old castle sim with upgraded visuals, modernized gameplay, Steam-integrated multiplayer, and a brand-new campaign.
Stronghold: Definitive Edition will feature the original game's classic military and economic campaigns as well as a new 14-mission narrative campaign. Furthermore, a 10-mission "Castle Trail" mission pack will allow you to defend or siege real historical castles. There will also be Steam Workshop integration allowing players to create and share their own maps.
We also got a nifty reveal trailer showing off the pretty new visuals:

That’s not really news to anyone by now, but what is news is that The Last of Us’ excellence has helped it make history as the first live-action adaptation of a video game to be nominated for any major awards. In this case, the Emmys, where it’s up for no less than two dozen awards.

But hey, when it's Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector we're talking about, I think it's okay to give it a pass. I am so, so pumped to head back into the world of the Helion System developer Jump Over The Age has created here, even if it's going to be a good long while before we get to do that yet. Indeed, when I spoke to them ahead of the game's reveal at this year's PC Gaming Show, creator Gareth Damian Martin said it probably wouldn't be until at least next year before we start seeing it in action.   
The good news is, while we wait for Starward Vector to come into orbit, Damian Martin is putting out a free monthly newsletter to help fill that Citizen Sleeper-shaped hole in our lives. Entitled The Helion Dispatches, the second episode just came out this week, and I've been enjoying it immensely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days, weeks often feel like years, so if you told me Steam Next Fest happened back at the start of the year, I’d believe you. And yet, it was little under a month ago that Valve kicked off its annual demo-filled celebration of upcoming PC games. Now, it’s checking back in with a ranking of the most popular demos that people played - and it’s a doozy of a list.

Join us today on Twitch at 10:00 a.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Nintendo is pushing Pikmin 4 hard before its July 21 release, and you love to see it. Like several of the publisher's older franchises, I'm always willing to let Pikmin have its time in the sun, and now you can literally do that with a set of Pikmin vases.
Revealed by the My Nintendo Store UK Twitter account, a trio of Pikmin vases will release on September 15, 2023, as a "My Nintendo Store exclusive." Nintendo once again decided to go with the classic three Pikmin: red, yellow, and blue. According to the listing, the size of each ceramic vase is roughly 13cm x 5.6cm, and clock in at £17.99 each, or £53.99 for all three. That translates to roughly 70 USD. That's quite a bit, but Nintendo has never shied away from costly merch.
https://twitter.com/NintendoStoreUK/status/1679464884512202752
You can find them for pre-order here, along with a few other pieces of Pikmin merch. If I had to get just one, I'd go with the blue Pikmin. The open-mouth look is just so striking and strange: it'll be a conversation piece!

If you're looking for more Pikmin 4 merch, there is some out there
PlayAsia has a set of Pikmin terrariums up for pre-order now for $51.99 (USD). It's a set of six and features various events and activities from the series. Note that the pre-order deadline for the terrariums on PlayAsia is July 24, and they are available at other places like Amazon.jp, but some outlets do not ship overseas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical has been delayed by one week. 
Initially due out on August 3, the musical RPG will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10. As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. 


Here’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: 
For the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. 
These songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.
Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though Game Pass may pick up the slack
Both Starfield and MachineGames' Indiana Jones are going to be exclusives for the Xbox. As such, not only will a lot of PlayStation owners be pissed off they won't get to play either of these games, but some may question whether Microsoft has considered that this move will likely mean less sales.
However, the Xbox company has anticipated this, it seems. Screenshots from court documents used in the Microsoft vs. FTC case (as uploaded by games journalist Stephen Totilo) reveal that Tim Stuart, chief financial officer for the tech giant, believes exclusivity won't be a problem.
https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1679307950706372611
In fact, Microsoft is confident both Starfield and Indiana Jones would sell "more than 10 million units" if they were going to be released on PlayStation. Testifying in court, Stuart said that the company had "evaluated exclusivity of ZeniMax [parent company of Bethesda] games in December 2020".
Ten million is a huge potential loss
Having said that, Microsoft is certain it can offset such a potential loss through Game Pass. By making Starfield and Indiana Jones available on the Xbox cloud service, the company hopes to make up for not selling 10 million units via its biggest competitor.
In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't seem like Stuart or Microsoft are concerned about not being able to shift millions more on the PlayStation. Given the immense hype surrounding Bethesda's upcoming sci-fi RPG, there's no question about it being able to make a significant profit.
Starfield is due for release on September 6 for Xbox Series X|S and PC. If you want something to do until then, may we suggest this 1,000-page compendium?

The even newer edition features the original game's two campaigns alongside a new one designed by studio co-founders Simon Bradbury and Eric Ouellette. The fresh campaign takes us across the "devastated English hinterland," while presumably doing what you'd expect from the series: gathering resources, managing your economy, building stuff, and waging war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These winds might be blowing in a favorable direction
I think Natsume is pretty confident in Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos. After announcing the game was on its way last year with no video or artwork beyond a logo reveal, it started to ramp up interest in the upcoming title with screenshot releases on its social media channels. Coming off of Harvest Moon: One World, it didn't too bad. In fact, it looked like it could be the best Harvest Moon game since Bokujō Monogatari dipped. With the release of the first trailer, that's still a definite possibility (even if it is a mighty low bar to clear).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUSvjMFkfhA
Right now, the farming sim genre is as competitive as it's ever been. Stardew Valley remains the stalwart favorite of the category, but that hasn't stopped a trove of indie and established developers from their hats into the ring. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life just dropped, and in the months ahead, we'll see titles like Fae Farm, The Ranchers, and Pixelshire. Despite the issues the series has had over the past decade, I think the Harvest Moon name still carries some weight in the industry, and with this trailer looking as good as it does, I wouldn't be surprised to see more people opting to give the Natsume series a shot this time around. This may end up as another misfire along the lines of Harvest Moon: One World, but I'm choosing to have a positive outlook on life.
Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos will launch for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on September 26, 2023. One thing to make note of if you're looking to get this on Switch is everything in the trailer was captured on a PS5. Just something to keep in mind.

Video game compilations might feel like a new-ish thing — a bevvy of digital treats all packed into one cartridge (or disc, or download), but they're practically as old as the medium. When we think of classic compilations, one of the first that springs to mind is the SNES's Super Mario All-Stars.
This 16-bit collection launched on 14th July 1993 in Japan, meaning this classic compilation is 30 years old. Hey, time flies when you're having fun! Before the semi-sequel that is (sorry, was) Super Mario 3D All-Stars, the original got a Wii rerelease, which coincided with Super Mario Bros.'s 25th anniversary, and you can play Super Mario All-Stars as part of the SNES library of Nintendo Switch Online.

Recently, it was announced that Twitch would be improving its revenue splits through what's being called the Partner Plus program. This means streamers will be entitled to a 70/30 split instead of the current 50/50, providing they meet certain requirements.
However, while it's generally been accepted that this is a step in the right direction, more than a few content creators are concerned about the upcoming program. Speaking to Eurogamer recently, a number of streamers say they feel the scheme is "anti-community," with concerns that a lot of people who regularly use Twitch to stream will struggle to qualify.

In April, the CMA blocked this acquisition over cloud gaming concerns, making Microsoft’s fight for the green light in this acquisition more challenging. But it shifted its sights on the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. afterward, with plans to appeal the CMA’s ruling in the meantime. 


Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard.

Then I slowly swapped all of that out for gems, and my board became a pristine, soulless, basically fully optimised money printer. 
Luck Be A Landlord is about meeting ever escalating rent demands by playing a slot machine. Each month gives you a limited number of spins to come up with the money, and the chance to add one of three random symbols after each spin. Those symbols bounce off each other in zany but logical ways: bees pollinate flowers, comedians amplify monkeys. Dogs befriend humans. Billionaires get guillotined.

We are just one week away from the release of Pikmin 4 now. If you have been anticipating this one for the past seven years then we assume that you have already played through the demo and you might even have the preload all set up and ready to go on 21st July. But have you yet acquired all the merch?
There have been some particularly pretty merchandise announcements for the game so far (much of which is coming only to Japan), and the latest item to drop on the European My Nintendo Store might just be pushing our gaming shelves from, "oh, you like Pikmin?" to "oh, you like Pikmin".

Pikmin 4 is just a week out, and if you happen to have preordered a digital copy of the game from the Switch eShop, you can now preload it. The game download should already be underway unless you need to free up some space on your system or have certain other settings disabled.
While the demo was only around 4.8 GB in size, the full digital version will require 10.4 GB of free space to fit on your home menu. Keep in mind, there will also be future updates for the game as well. And if you haven't already pre-ordered you can always head on over to the eShop now to claim a copy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making 'ample space' for the gods
The summer is becoming increasingly packed for games, especially as dates start to shift around. With Baldur's Gate 3 moving its release date up, it put Larian's RPG in direct contention with another RPG, Stray Gods.
Now, Summerfall Studios is taking the opportunity for a slight delay. Originally scheduled for August 3, Summerfall is pushing the launch of its musical RPG to August 10. And in a statement on the matter, the studio was pretty straightforward about why:
"We want everyone to have ample space to check out Stray Gods when it launches," said the studio. "Baldur's Gate 3 is hotly anticipated (by us, too!) and we want to give our fans room to celebrate Stray Gods."
The extra time may prove a boon, though. As the statement goes on to say, Summerfall is taking on a lot by launching on a plethora of platforms—PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.
"This is a huge undertaking for any team, let alone an indie shipping its first title," said Summerfall. "This extra week allows us to have performance parity as close as possible—across every platform."

I admire the candor, as well as the hope that players looking forward to both of these games could finish the titanic Baldur's Gate 3 in a week's time. Jokes aside, though, an extra week can be a silver lining for a team to put extra polish on something.
Stray Gods is definitely on my shortlist for the summer. It's a role-playing adventure centered around actual musical performances, with quite a star-studded cast. Having a little extra time to space these games out will be nice, and hopefully give Summerfall whatever extra time it needs to fine-tune all its launches.
Stray Gods arrives on August 10 for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

There’s no real reason why I should love Pikmin as much as I do. On paper, the idea of having a salad army run around picking up rocket parts doesn’t sound too exciting. However, Nintendo hooked me right away back in 2001. My new GameCube was hungry, and I was eager to feed it more.
Nowhere has my enthusiasm for the game been tested quite like with the wait for Pikmin 4. Shigeru Miyamoto first teased us about it back in 2015, and then Nintendo remained coy about it until just recently. Pikmin 4 is finally happening, and it’s happening very soon.
So, while I eagerly sit here, chewing on my fingernails and waiting for it to reach my local game shop, I’m going to take a look back at the series up to this point. Once the new game does reach my big meaty claws, I’ll circle bac…]]></summary>

Larian Studios is nearing a moved-up launch date for its massive RPG Baldur's Gate 3. But while the adventure is arriving sooner than announced, it comes with a caveat that PC owners won't get an extra-extra head start.
Originally, Larian had planned to give a 72-hour head start to everyone who picked up the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur's Gate 3. This Early Access would allow a head start on Act 1, the same area already in the current Early Access build, but in the 1.0 version. It would've been a lot of players too, as Larian upgraded everyone who bought the Early Access of Baldur's Gate 3 to the Digital Deluxe Edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super brawling robot
Strap on your robo-boots, Domesticated Ant Games has dropped their retro-inspired platformer, Gravity Circuit, today.
What’s Gravity Circuit? I’m just learning that right now, myself. Past me really dug it since I put it on my wishlist and forgot about it. I can totally see why! It looks like a missing link between the classic Mega Man series and Mega Man X.
You play as metal hero Kai, who is trying to stop the evil doings of the Virus Army. Gravity Circuit barely tries to hide its influences behind a fake mustache. There’s ride armor and upgrade chips. However, there seem to be more combat options, as hand-to-hand plays a big part. It claims to have action “dialed to the max.” Its trailer sure makes it look like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnwIQ3hpDTk
The graphics are done in a way that emulates the NES color palette. Obviously, a lot of the effects would be extremely difficult to pull off on the actual 8-bit hardware, but the aesthetic is there.
Mega Man X is my comfort food, and I feel there’s more room in the world for platformers that can nail that same pace and feel. I’m not sure Gravity Circuit can do that, but I’m willing to find out.
You can find out yourself on Switch, PS4, PS5, or PC. Gravity Circuit is available today.

Six weeks have passed since the release of Diablo 4, and people are really diving into theory crafting to try and min/max their builds. Content creator Rob2628 discovered a unique interaction for the Barbarian class that resulted in some absolutely insane damage numbers.
And when we say insane, we're not exaggerating. At its peak, he was able to do 35 undecillion damage in a single hit. If you're like me and have no idea what an undecillion looks like, here's the number type out:

In the outlet's latest video, John Linneman puts The Last Hope through its paces and it's fair to say that it is bad. Really bad. In fact, Digital Foundry even goes as far as to say that it is "the worst game we've ever reviewed," with "no redeemable features whatsoever" — yikes.

Manic Mechanics is the marquee game showcased by Nintendo this week, and it's coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop today.

So far, it sounds decent! Nintendo managed to get their paws in the door on the eShop this week too, as they've just released the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Wave 5 DLC.

The actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. 


Wayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. 
Clock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['80s and '90s Nintendo games on the 'endangered' list.
You may have read a recent study by the Video Games History Foundation that suggests an eye-watering 87% of video games are "critically endangered". The organisation, which is devoted to video game preservation and archiving, found that just 13% of games released prior to 2010 were still 'in print' and officially available to buy, play, and enjoy.
It's a shocking, sobering statistic, especially given the relative youth of the medium. Nintendo, thanks to its revered status in the video gaming industry and community, enjoys unrivalled interest and a nostalgia factor that shines a spotlight on even its most obscure titles and territory-exclusive releases. Today, Nintendo Switch Online has taken the place of the Virtual Console which began on Wii, and — compared to many other publishers — a significant amount of its vintage software is relatively easy to play these days, even if it's tied to a subscription service.

Valve's team-based shooter Team Fortress 2 isn't exactly the most grim, serious game. While it centers around mercs fighting each other for control of objectives, its tone has certainly been light-hearted. And that carries over to the latest, community-driven update that brought an adorable seal into Team Fortress 2.
As part of the Summer 2023 update, which is seeing Team Fortress 2 hit some new player count records, there are 14 new maps to play. One of these, Selbyen, is a Player Destruction map with a simple objective: be the team that feeds the most fish to the seal.
While carnage ensues, players can pick up and give buckets of fish to the seal that will routinely hop through the center of the map. Really, it should be obvious how the fanbase has reacted to an adorable…]]></summary>

Team Fortress 2 got a surprisingly large update this week, and it seems like players are flocking to it. Steam charts show Team Fortress 2 hitting an all-time player high following the Summer 2023 update.
Judging by Steam tracking site SteamDB, Valve's team-based shooter climbed well above its previous player count records with the Summer 2023 addition to Team Fortress 2. Anecdotally, it seems like a lot of people are hopping back on, too.
What's in the content update, though? It's actually a lot of community content. A while back, Valve had put out a call for Steam Workshop submissions for a seasonal update. The Summer 2023 update looks to be the fruits of the community's labor, bringing in 14 new maps and even fully incorporating a game mode, VSH—Versus Saxton H…]]></summary>

The survival genre is one that’s never entirely worked for me. Life is already stressful enough, and playing a game built on the idea of stress, resource management, and, well, survival has never appealed to me in my off-hours. But Keen Games, the studio behind Portal Knights, let me watch roughly an hour of gameplay of its new survival game Enshrouded behind closed doors, and I came away excited about everything it’s doing to alleviate the stresses of the genre. 
Keen Games describes Enshrouded as an open-world survival action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world drowned by a mysterious fog. You play as a unique person brought back to life by a powerful force called The Flame. From there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Ra Ra Boom, an upcoming beat 'em up headed to PC this year. Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. 
Enjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


In 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a "rising tides raise all ships" scenario. 
After playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. 
Ra Ra Boom hits PC this fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming action RPG from Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Vampyr, which was first revealed at The Game Awards last December. The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. 
The game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  


Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Trade Commission has filed an appeal to a California judge’s ruling earlier this week in its Activision Blizzard acquisition court case against Microsoft. 
Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring the Call of Duty maker. The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order Microsoft to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal, and it did so on July 12. 
Here’s what the FTC’s appeal filing says:

Ah, Doom. Who knows where we'd be today if it weren't for the innovation that made you the granddaddy of first-person shooters? Probably one of the things that's helping to keep id Software's iconic game alive after all these years is the fact that it can be ported to just about anything. It's even possible to play Doom inside Doom itself.
As you can imagine, many people have attempted to see what crazy methods they can to play this legendary FPS. Now, some scientists are doing something a little different. Namely, they want to see if it's possible to grow their own neurons that can be taught to play games. And yes, they want to see if they will be able to control Doom.
A video from the YouTube channel The Thought Emporium goes into detail about the hypothesis. The basic idea …]]></summary>

Hacker group UWeaPons Store has found a new way to run emulated software on the Xbox Series consoles...again. Earlier this year, Microsoft closed the consoles' original loophole that allowed players to run emulated games in the console's base "retail" mode. We thought it might not open again, but Youtuber Modern Vintage Gamer recently revealed otherwise.
https://youtu.be/WdFBseEphwo
One of the Xbox Series S|X's strengths is the ability to download specific apps from Microsoft's store. Some such apps allow players to run emulated games from various systems without having to resort to modding. The original loophole bypassed Microsoft's requirement of a $20 monthly payment to gain access to the "developer" mode, where Microsoft is fine with users gaining access to such software. The loophole allowed an Xbox to also mostly be a PS2, a GameCube, a Dreamcast, and even a Nintendo Wii at no extra cost. That's the part that Microsoft didn't like.
UWeaPons Store has found yet another confirmed loophole. Still, the group is not openly disclosing its findings out of fear of triggering a quick response from Microsoft. Anyone interested in gaining access to the forbidden knowledge will need to subscribe to the group’s Patreon.
This doesn't guarantee that Microsoft won't find the loophole and shut it down, but it still makes a statement. It further clarifies that gamers want video game preservation, and want it at a non-premium level. As we all know, video game preservation is at serious risk.

As with its ancestors, you're invading a fictional country with a team of dysfunctional freelance mercenaries, managing their equipment and clashing personalities through a guerrilla war on an open world map whose every sector can host turn-based battles.
It challenges the all-smothering XCOM standard of "two actions per turn" by restoring the ancient way of the Action Point. Everyone has a dozen or so action points per turn to split between movement, shooting, or miscellaneous contextual actions. Chance to hit is never listed, but accuracy can be bumped by spending extra action points. It innovates too by giving everyone a small pool of free movement, keeping battles moving, and broadening the tactical possibilities. It borrows as much from modern designs and is mostly better for it.

Yesterday's stream from Limited Run Games certainly had its share of curious announcements for anyone still holding onto their GBA or who actually liked Gex. I told myself I wouldn't give it any thought this year as my backlog is already stuffed with old games LRG has resurrected over the years. But then they had to go and show off a Rose & Camellia collection. Now, they had my attention.
For anyone who forgot or is simply too young to even know about it, Rose & Camellia is a ridiculous flash game where you try to worm your way to the top of the pecking order by smacking the shit out of your competition. I remember playing this game one lonely night at work, completely enthralled by its ludicrous nature. Unbeknownst to me, it got an official sequel, and later a crossover with La-Mulana. All three of those games, as well as two new sequels, are being brought together by LRG, Nigoro, and WayForward for the Rose & Camellia Collection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA6U2v-X9PI
With five games and more than 30 characters, your hands are going to be sore after slapping your way to the top of the household. What I'm most excited about are the motion controls. It just wouldn't feel right if you were pressing a button or flicking a control stick to Zsa-Zsa a woman. This is honestly the first time I've been excited about motion controls in a Switch game since...well, I guess the reveal of WarioWare Move It! from a couple of weeks ago.
Either way, this whole thing looks like a hoot and it's nice that a piece of my past, even if it was just for one night, is managing to make its way back into my life with this port. Rose & Camellia Collection will launch in late 2023/early 2024 for the Nintendo Switch.
Oh, I should mention it has two-player local versus. So you and your friends can stop settling it in Smash and settle it in slaps.

As it turns out, there's been one particular demonstration that's stood out above the rest, and that's House Flipper 2.
If you haven't had a chance to check out the original game, you're missing out, especially if you're into methodical, job-based simulations. The sequel is due for release sometime in 2023, and a recent update on Steam shows that not only was House Flipper 2 the most downloaded demo of the recent Next Fest event, but it came top ahead of Lies of P.

Look, I’m not going to pretend that new games on retro hardware is a novel concept. If Destructoid’s Zoey “The Flying Zebra” Handley can write 1000+ words about an Atari Lynx game that came out in 2009, nothing should surprise me. I say should, because WayForward has announced that Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution will hit the Game Boy Advance in 2024, and it’s taken me a good hour to wrap my mind around it.
To provide some backstory, Shantae Advance is a long, long lost chapter of WayForward’s trademark Shantae series. Though it began development in the early 2000s, the lackluster sales of the first Shantae game scared off potential publishers. Refusing to release a compromised version of the game, WayForward decided to cancel the project in 20…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little tongue now, a lot of tail later (What!?)
As part of the Limited Run Games Showcase stream, the physical publisher announced that they’re resurrecting the GEX series as in the GEX Trilogy. Wow. Oh no.
Like a few of their surprise game announcements, there wasn’t much to go on from the trailer they showed. If I’m not mistaken, the James Bond parody was a promo for the third game way back in the day. Or maybe it was the second. That lizard really liked parodying characters who were cooler than him. However, the trailer does reveal that the GEX Trilogy will be coming to most current platforms via the Carbon Engine.
https://youtu.be/HhXZZsEfRgk
So, Timothy “Toothpick-Fingers” Monbleau and I immediately started venting our shared trauma with this announcement. He played a lot of the first game on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, while I, as a kid, spent way too much time playing GEX 64. None of the three games included in the trilogy are terrible, honestly. If anything, the most grating part about it is listening to the eponymous gecko spit one-liners that I didn’t really understand at the time. The first game is a sidescroller, whereas the two that followed are collect-a-thon platformers.
Anyway, any port of these games is a net gain. I’ll be honest, I will probably pick up a digital copy of the GEX Trilogy. I already own all three of these games (the first on Saturn, the other two on N64), but I’m willing to shell out to have them in one place and support the endeavors of kusoge preservation.
GEX Trilogy is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC at some point in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nice do
As part of the Limited Run Games showcase, the boutique publisher announced a number of retro games that are getting modern ports. Among them is Tomba, the 1998 (1997 if you count the Japanese release) platformer by legendary developer Tokuro Fujiwara.
Tomba is a game about the eponymous and fabulous pink-haired caveman. It’s a rather ambitious gated exploration platformer for the PS1 platform that got a sequel, but not nearly enough love. I was actually introduced to it through the passionate rantings of Destructoid alumni James Stephanie Sterling. Original PS1 copies go for mad dough on the collector’s market, but I think seeing one in person might have me making my wallet cry.
However, it’s not necessary for you to make your wallet cry. Instead, Limited Run Games is bringing Tomba to modern platforms. That’s about all the information we have right now. The trailer shown during the stream was just a cutscene. A Tweet following the stream clarified that it will be coming to us with the help of the proprietary Carbon Engine, and will have physical and digital versions.
https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1679227783149486082?s=20
Good enough! I’m just happy that Limited Run Games is whole hogging it with retro revivals. Game preservation has been a topic that I’ve been pounding on for a while now, and I’m happy to see another company take a leap with it. Limited Run Games has had a history with preservation, but it seems like they’re really doubling down on it!
Tomba will be coming to PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC eventually. No word yet if Tomba 2 will be getting the same treatment.

It looks like a faithful recreation of the SNES original, with a fresh localization and bonus features.

Blizzard President Mike Ybarra took to Twitter to squash a rumor that Diablo 4 was coming to Game Pass. In a tweet that has since been deleted, an ad from Brazilian gift card retailer PICPAY indicated Diablo 4 was on Xbox Game Pass.
"Available now. Get it now or play it through Xbox Game Pass" the advertisement allegedly read. Ybarra didn't mince words when responding to the claim, stating "This is not happening."
https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1678564200581595137
This isn't the first time Blizzard has addressed the possibility of Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. Back in May, Executive Producer Rod Fergusson tweeted "We've been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that." Although it seems like a popular request for the action-RPG to be part of the membership, it doesn't appear that will happen any time soon.
Maybe other Blizzard games will hit Game Pass
I know it's hard to even imagine Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. But with recent legal developments, it may not be a strange thought for long. After all, Bethesda's first brand new IP in a long time, Starfield, will launch on Game Pass day 1.
We may see not-so-new Blizzard titles eventually make their way to the pass. Perhaps even the older iterations of Diablo like Diablo III. We'll have to see which Blizzard IP finds its way to the subscription service first.
For now, though, it looks like Diablo 4 will continue to have a full-price barrier to entry. Who knows, maybe we'll get some sort of discount when Season 1 of Diablo 4 releases on July 20.

Juggling two core systems that work in tandem, it’s a game that excels as both an exploration experience and as a management sim and does so in ways that are intuitive and easy to pick up. However, the real triumph is a focus on novelty at every turn, with a near-constant supply of sudden twists, activities, and ways to engage with the game, resulting in a joyful and approachable adventure that is hard to put down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teletext. Notepad. Twitter. A tractor. A pregnancy test. There have been few limits to the weird and wonderful ways that enterprising Doom fans have found to play the seminal FPS over the last 30 years, but this latest one might take the crown for both weirdest and wonderful-est. Someone is teaching a bunch of lab-grown rat neurons to play Doom. Yes, their literal conscious existence is Doom. I told you it was weird.

        <updated>2023-07-12T18:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, an upcoming sequel in the classic beat 'em up series. Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.
Enjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


Developer Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. 
Secret Base says the beat 'em up features "seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves." Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Like Alice0 wrote when The Banished Vault was first announced seven months ago, the idea of exploring space in "an interstellar gothic monastery" is obviously an instant yes, but I'm also drawn to its neat, grid-like maps of its procedurally generated solar systems, as well as the haunting monochrome portraits of your band of exiled survivors. It looks stunning, and happily the wait for it is almost over, as Tringali and publishers Bithell Games have announced it will be coming to PC on July 25th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers Bulkhead are now offering refunds to all Kickstarter backers who supported World War 2 FPS Battalion 1944, also known as Battalion: Legacy. The studio described the development process as an Icarus situation where the team “flew too close to the sun,” and “were unable to accomplish all the goals” that were laid out in the initial Kickstarter plans, leading to these refunds.


Bulkhead announced plans to refund players last year after cancelling the console ports, although all backers are eligible for a refund regardless of pledge tier, platform, or time played. No questions asked. Backers can find information on how to claim refunds via an email from the company.

        <updated>2023-07-12T12:34:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Souls, the upcoming third-person horror game from first-time developer Jukai Studio, will hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this fall. 
Jukai Studio and publisher Versus Evil announced this release window in a new trailer that also revealed Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka will guest compose on the game’s score. And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” 
Check out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. 
Stray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall. 
Are you going to check out Stray Souls later this year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Worldless, which was revealed at last night's ID@Xbox Showcase, is one such Metroidy platformer that's hoping to shake things up with its rhythmic, turn-based battling. I had a sneak peak at its freshly released Steam demo back in March at GDC, and I came away impressed by both its abstract visuals and fluid, dance-like scraps with its angular enemies. The demo is only 30 minutes or so, so why not give it a go for yourself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I played a timed early demo of Forever Skies last year, my key question about this airborne Subnautica-like was how it would successfully guide its players across its boundless world of ruined, rusting skyscrapers, overgrown plant tendrils and swampy, toxic clouds. As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? 
Having now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.

Katharine gave it a glittering review, with words like "beautifully crisp" to describe the sound, so you know the patter of gunfire will conjure up sensations similar to, say, taking some sizzling roast potatoes out of the oven.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember playing the first Oxenfree so clearly. The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.
So I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals delivers what I have wanted out of a sequel seven years after the first game's release. Although its overarching A-to-C narrative feels like it is missing a “B” in the journey, I’m impressed with most of what Oxenfree II accomplishes. It brings back the original's simple but charming radio mechanics, adds a walkie-talkie that expands the world around protagonist Riley, and, most importantly, features incredibly well-written and believable characters. While Oxenfree II’s paranormal events are spooky an…]]></summary>

For almost 20 years, Nihon Falcom has created one the richest ensembles of original characters, history, and politics in video games with The Legend of Heroes. Across three narrative arcs (and counting), I’ve explored myriad diverse locations, cultures, governments, and organizations, making the continent of Zemuria the most lived-in world I’ve ever experienced in the medium. Trails into Reverie, the latest entry in the long-running franchise, is a bittersweet culmination; I must potentially say goodbye to some of these characters for good after the series succ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. 
Back in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. 
Our statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS
July 11, 2023
It's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is "ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report," likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). 
Game Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. 
What do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The legal proceedings led to juicy behind-the-scenes details about revenue shares, blockbuster budgets, and other potential acquisitions. But after listening to five days worth of testimonies, Judge Corley has decided to rule in Microsoft’s favour, allowing the company to close its $70 billion acquisition.

        <updated>2023-07-11T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. 
Tuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. 
Check out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:


Tuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.
“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” 

Let Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. 
Tuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”]]></summary>

Thankfully, the post-launch plans do get slightly weirder with two crossovers: one with Street Fighter and another with Monster Hunter.

Perhaps embarrassed by the relatively small amount of egg on their face compared to some of their more ridiculous contemporaries, Konami have decided to come crawling back to try and buy our collective forgiveness by way of their second-only-to-Squeenix PS1 back catalogue. Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. 
MGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago.

The new multi-department union represents over 200 employees at the company’s Irvine and Burbank offices, working across divisions including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, live service, and more. Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” 


AEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”

Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.

Our James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.

In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).
Choosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've put up with a clunky clicker for too long, now's the time to pull the trigger, or in this case, press down with enough force to add the HyperX Pulsefire Haste to your basket. It's got a hefty 50% discount for Amazon Prime Day, the biggest discount since last year's Black Friday. Can I vouch for it? Yes, I have one! It's light and accurate and does a very good job of skating across my mat like a perfectly tuned puck.
The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a cracking option if you're after a no-nonsense gaming mouse that'll stand you in good stead for anything, really. MOBAs, ARPGs, the likes of CS:GO, all handled brilliantly by the Pixart 3335 sensor. Its honeycomb shell also means it's really light, with an ambidextrous body suited to lefties or righties alike. I wouldn't say the included grip tape is all that useful, mind. Mine sort of peeled off, but I've had no qualms popping my thumbs and fingers on its plastic body.

There is, however, a lick of sense behind it. Sifting through the hundreds, if not thousands of discounted gaming wares is a time-hungry process – just ask Ed and Liam, who I’ve shandhaied into helping this year – and the main Prime Day PC gaming deals hub, the Prime Day graphics card deals hub, and the Prime Day Steam Deck accessories deals hub all tend to get larger but less frequent updates. To say nothing of the Anti-Prime Day deals guide, which also highlights savings on quality hardware from non-Amazon sellers. Keep an eye on this liveblog, though, and we’ll point out the really great stuff more or less as soon as we find it.

This is a 40% savings versus the launch price of £599, a huge discount that surpasses the last deal we've seen on AMD's fastest 12-core, 24-thread CPU by more than £100. 
I hope you can understand the excitement, as this is a great price for a high-end CPU that perfectly balances gaming and content creation performance, making it ideal for gamers that also indulge in video work, 3D rendering or coding.

        <updated>2023-07-10T17:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.
EA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.
EA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.
We'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!]]></summary>

The Arma series usually prides itself on realistic military simulations - apart from that one kooky expansion that added aliens - so WWII is almost the perfect battlefield for the long-running shooter. 


Developer Bohemia Interactive say we’ll “be a part of the US First Army’s advance as they attempt to break through the German lines,” while using US equipment to “traverse the fields and bocage an all-new Normandy terrain.” Take a look at the impending battle below.

        <updated>2023-07-10T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.
The upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”
Cliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. 
“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.
Black Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones.

Both publishers gave non-committal responses but we know more redos/reimaginings/remakes are coming. Of course they are. Seemingly every publisher under the sun is onboard the remake train and it’s only a matter of time before your favourite game gets a nostalgic refresh. So, dear readers, what older games would you like to see return?

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With millions of users, YTS is arguably the most visited torrent site. The site owes its popularity to the constant stream of pirate movies it makes available. For several years, this excluded titles from Millennium Media, Voltage Pictures, and other independent film companies, due to a settlement agreement with the site's operator. However, somewhere along the line, YTS decided to disobey this agreement.

I keep meaning to write something about this but it boils down to a kinda straightforward thought: Diablo 4 is so perfectly occupying yet uninteresting that I could play it for 700 hours while chatting with pals as a hangout game or I could never touch it again, and I have no preference in either direction. That's all. So. I will not be playing Diablo 4 this weekend. What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we are clicking on!

If you looked at it and went "ooh", your coo lobe was right. "Design a vehicle" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.

We were going to talk about children's games this week, but given the game for children I was going to talk about was once Stadia exclusive Gylt it seemed a time to talk about the precariousness of digital media a bit (and also make James explain Stadia).


We've all been playing a few games here and there, and most of them are current, with Nate still very enthusiastic about being a dinosaur. James comes with more beans to the hardware altar, and we all have some slightly weird suggestions for your recommendations. Plus, because Liam is actually away this week, I made a special effort to pay attention to audio levels and reduce background noise because I've seen ye all complaining about when I have to edit the podcast and I'm sick of it.

        <updated>2023-07-07T13:05:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since played the Gunbrella demo at the Devolver Digital booth at PAX West last year, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it again. I don’t usually go for nails Metriodvanias, but there’s something about Gunbrella’s slick, parkour platforming and scrappy world that made me wanna give it a chance. Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?
The demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.

The debut trailer was full of creepy shape-shifting monsters and evocative cityscapes, but relatively light on concrete details. We now have a clearer picture thanks to a recent dev diary that shows a few pre-alpha clips. Slitterhead seems to have a heavier focus on combat and a cute playable dog. Genuine shocker there.


In-game footage is scattered throughout the video, but the good stuff starts to show up at the 3-minute mark. Take a quick peek:

Season of the Malignant introduces a new questline set after the main campaign in which Malignant Monsters, born from Lilith’s corruption, are terrorizing Sanctuary. It’s up to you and a former priest named Cormond to locate and eradicate the source of this blight. 


Killing these creatures lets players harness their corrupted hearts to transform into new powers. Up to 30 new Malignant abilities are borne from these monsters, and this power can be imbued into Rings and Amulets. This update also introduces a new boss in the form of Varshan the Consumed.

A new post and a new trailer from developers Arrowhead explaining how Helldivers 2's combat and co-op works is, at least, an opportunity to differentiate itself.

        <updated>2023-07-06T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

        <updated>2023-07-06T15:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

A mod that lets you slay hollowed enemies as Tony Hawk is a good guess, but Dark Souls Pro Skater is almost the reverse. A clip went viral over the weekend showing praise-the-sun-guy Solaire shredding around the game’s opening Firelink Shrine. And yes, it looks as cool as it sounds. 


You can watch the clip on Twitter, but if that cursed site’s not working, you can find it on YouTube. There’s also a version that has Shrek shredding but badly, for some reason. Firelink’s ancient, mysterious ruins are transformed into a fun skatepark. Who cares where the skaters came from? Just grind, Gwyndammnit.

Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year.

Nowadays, Barlow is known for making Her Story and founding the studio Half Mermaid, developer of Telling Lies and Immortality.

“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.
“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go developer Niantic has announced a massive restructuring, where it will be closing its Los Angeles office, terminating over 200 employees, and scaling back development on a few titles as it narrows its focus towards supporting current titles while increasing its commitment to mixed and augmented reality development.
