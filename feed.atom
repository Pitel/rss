It's the weekend folks, so hopefully you're already putting your feet up, sipping on a nice cup of tea, and enjoying a bit of down time with some games.
This week in the world of Nintendo, a new placeholder listing at a retailer may (or may not) hint towards a cheaper-than-expected price for the Nintendo Switch 2. Meanwhile, a new patent has been made public that heavily hints towards 'reversible' Joy-Con functionality; effectively letting you flip the Switch 2 upside down.

The popular team-based hero title Marvel Rivals has experienced an incredibly successful launch and as it continues to grow developer NetEase Games is looking at new ways to expand the experience. While it's reportedly ruled out a release on the original Switch, it seems there's a real chance of the game coming to the Switch 2.
Speaking to IGN at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu mentioned how the team was "already in contact with Nintendo" and was apparently "working on some development kits", so the decision will come down to how the game performs on the system:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though John Noble had been cast for Season 2 of Severance, we've yet to see his character as we reach the halfway point of the season. Well, sorta. Let's talk about who John Noble plays in Severance Season 2.


Image via Apple TV+


Who is John Noble's character?


In the Severance Season 1 finale we learn that Burt's outie is actually married. We only see a glimpse of his husband when Irving's innie approaches Burt's house and bangs on the door. In Season 2 Episode 5, Burt confronts Irving about what happened in the finale of Season 1, before informing him that his husband, Cecil Fields, was upset about the events that transpired. Despite the trouble caused, Burt invites Irving over to his house to have ham with him and his husband Fields.


It looks as though the Fringe and Lord of the Rings actor will be taking over the role of Burt's husband Fields in Severance Season 2. We haven't seen him just yet, but it looks likely we will in Severance Season 2 Episode 6 which is titled Atilla.


So was John Noble cast as Fields in Severance Season 1?


Nope! Even though we got a glimpse of Fields at the end of Severance Season 1, it was very brief and was not played by John Noble. In Season 1, Fields was portrayed by Arthur Brooks, who also appeared in Independence Day, Beverly Hills 90210, Newhart, and more.


Interestingly, if you look back at the Season 1 finale, Arthur Brooks as Fields actually looked like it could have been John Noble. As such, it's likely the deal for Noble to play as Fields in Season 2 was already done, but he was unavailable to film the brief scene in the finale which led to them picking someone who could look close enough that it wouldn't be a complete shock to the audience to see him again in Season 2.


Based on Irving accepting the invitation from Burt to come over and join him and Fields for ham, we might be finally seeing John Noble in Severance Season 2 pretty soon!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each section of the Ability tree requires reaching various ranks in the Fighter, Ranger, and Wizard classes. If you want the most of this feature, you must unlock the maximum player level. So, let's dive into the Avowed max level.


What is the maximum player level in Avowed?


The Avowed maximum player rank is Level 30, where you must earn more than 100,000 XP. A feat such as this will undoubtedly take up a lot of your time, and it may only be achievable during the game's later stages. However, given that there's a ton of content in the beginning, it could be possible to reach the maximum rank if you explore Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp to the fullest.


Avowed offers a multitude of ways to earn XP, from engaging in side quests to exploring new areas and undertaking bounty missions. One of the first things I like to do is fill out the map as much as possible. You can earn XP simply by walking into a new area, but you'll still need to fight off a few enemies here and there. For more help on this front, check out our guide on how to level up fast.


Once you reach Level 20, you can start collecting from the final tiers in the Fighter, Ranger, and Wizard classes. There's not really a bad choice here, as it mainly correlates to your playstyle. Continue to earn XP to reach the maximum level, unlocking the Peak Performance achievement. Xbox users will get 30 G points out of it, which you can exchange in the store.

Even if you do unlock the maximum level, there's still a lot that needs to be done in the achievement collection. You'll likely have to do multiple playthroughs, especially when it comes to major choices. It also involves objectives with your Companion skills and solving all the treasure maps. These ventures will undoubtedly include a lot of grinding, but at least you'll have the advantage of a maximum player level.

Avowed is set within the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity series, and the stats available reflect this, meaning they function similarly here, and certain ones hold the highest value for your character in the early game.

Here's what exactly that song is about, and how it may be a huge clue for what's going on in Severance.




What is The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald about?


The roughly six-minute song The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald was written, composed, and performed by Canadian singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot in 1976. Lightfoot wrote the song to memorialize the sinking of a bulk carrier ship, the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, that sank just a year earlier in Lake Superior on November 10, 1975.


Lyrically, the song tells the story of the fi…]]></summary>

Avowed features three points of no returns that occur in the following missions:

The Ancient Soil main quest is the first one you'll encounter, which fails missions within Fior mes Iverno after you complete it.

The latest objective has a host of different rewards for you to earn after completing the tasks. Let's take a look at how to complete the tasks, and what rewards you will get after finishing the full set. 


EA FC 25 Grassroot Greats: From the Ground Up objective guide


The Grassroot Greats: From the Ground Up objective has four different tasks for you to complete, and doing so will unlock all the available rewards.


Task
How to Complete
Rewards




Humble Beginnings
Play 3 games in any Ultimate Team game mode.
80+ x5 Rare Gold Players Pack


Finding the Net
Score at least 2 goals in 5 separate matches in any Ultimate Team game mode.
Prime Gold Players Pack


Rising to the Challenge
Win 7 games in any Ultimate Team game mode.
83+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack


Clean Sheet Legend
Keep 2 clean sheets in any Ultimate Team game mode.
80+ x5 Rare Gold Players Pack






The main rewards of the objective set is what you should be looking to get. It will require you to complete all the tasks, and doing so will unlock a special player pick. You'll be able to select 2 Grassroot Greats from a pool of 5 cards. All available items will be rated 89 or lower, which is a major limitation. However, you can get the cards for free, so there's not much to complaint. 


Thankfully, EA Sports has also kept the conditions pretty easy, and you can get them done in Friendlies as well. If you don't want to do so, Squad Battles is the best place to grind. You can just concentrate on the objective tasks, and winning the games are far more easier. 


While you grind out the objective, make sure to check out the N'Golo Kante Grassroot Greats SBC and Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC as well.

What's special about Drowned God: Conspiracy Of The Ages?


Drowned God: Conspiracy Of The Ages is a point-and-click adventure title in the vein of Myst and Riven. Though not as revolutionary as the games that inspired it, Drowned God enjoyed good reviews, featured gorgeously eerie art, and even earned some award nominations back in the day.

We were more than a little surprised when Hideki Kamiya and Capcom popped up at The Game Awards to announce an Okami sequel. Surprised, but excited. The title is still in early development and we know very little about it, but in a recent interview with IGN, some of its creatives began to explain what we can expect from the sequel and how it'll fit with the series' previous entries.
Throughout the interview with Kamiya, Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata, the trio refer to the upcoming sequel as "a continuation of the story that we saw in the original game". But, as any Okami fan will be able to tell you, we've already seen a follow-up (of sorts) in the 2011 DS follow-up, Okamiden.

        <updated>2025-02-14T17:37:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you first explore the region of Shatterscarp, you'll come across a roadblock with its broken lift. The NPCs will ask you to mend it, but the game doesn't necessarily tell you how. So, if you're wondering what to do, here's how to fix the Shatterscarp lift in Avowed.


How do you fix the lift at Shatterscarp in Avowed?


You'll likely encounter the broken lift while on the quest for the Fires in the Mine mission or when simply traveling around the Shatterscarp map. Interacting with the lever won't do you much good, so you'll need to go the long way around and fix it from the other side. Head towards Deadfall Highlands and then make your way to the Sulfur Mines Basecamp.


Screenshot by Destructoid


As you may expect, there will be a few enemies along this pathway, so come prepared with weapons and healing items. Once you cross the bridge to the camp, you must use electricity magic to power the generator on the lift's right side. You can shock the Essence Generator yourself with a grimoire or utilize Giatta's Spectral Jolt.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The lift should now work after you power the generator, allowing you to interact with the lever. Head down to get a nice little dialogue scene from the NPCs below it. I was hoping it would unlock a quest or reward with them, but nothing seems to be tied to them after this. I checked back on these characters, and they just continue to stick around there. However, this time, they're thankful for what you did.


An event could trigger later on, as the townsfolk mention they need to return to work soon. At the most, you can finish out the Fires in the Mines quest, which you can begin on your way to Thirdborn. The Shatterscarp lift will always work from now on, making travel much more accessible in Avowed.

I hope said test provided FromSoft with some helpful data, considering Nightreign releases in May, though it would have been a lot easier for everyone if I could’ve just sent Hidetaka Miyazaki an email saying "Sir, your server infrastructure is made of biscuits."
In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something uncanny about dipping "classic" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.

Before Nintendo Switch Online, there was Virtual Console. Available on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, the Virtual Console was effectively a line of purchasable retro games available via the Wii Shop Channel and eShop.
Unlike Nintendo Switch Online, which offers up a range of playable games for an annual or monthly cost, Virtual Console allowed you pay for games ad-hoc, enabling you to download whichever title you wanted and keep it indefinitely. While we certainly love what Nintendo has been doing with Switch Online over the years, it's no secret that lots of fans would rather the firm revert back to the Virtual Console model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed pays a lot of importance to a character's leveling-up system, and you should pay proper attention from the very beginning of your journey.


As you level up, you'll inherit different skills and boost your in-game stats. You'll be able to dedicate a level-up point to one of your major attributes (as long as you don't break the cap), along with secondary stats. This will make it easier to complete certain tasks and unlock new abilities after hitting important milestones.


When you complete any task in the game, you'll gain experience points and level up (standard Obsidian system). The main aim is to streamline the process to boost the speed you level up.


Best ways to level up in Avowed


Completing the main quests makes a lot of sense as that will allow you to progress through the main story and move closer to reaching the ending point. However, you should also invest an equal amount of time in side quests. You'll find plenty of them when you access new regions.


Completing the side quests has two major benefits. You'll gain a lot of useful in-game resources, which include new equipment and money, and your character will gain a lot of XP, allowing you to level up faster.

Similarly, Bounty Missions can be a great source for leveling up your character. You'll find boards set up in different regions, and going through them will allow you to accept the quests. Compared to side quests, Bounty Missions are a lot harder to complete. They're also far fewer in numbers and can't be farmed repeatedly.


That said, completing a Bounty Mission is extremely rewarding, as you get plenty of XP to level up, along with new resources. If you want to learn more about earning money in Avowed, check out our guide.


Ultimately, there's no rocket science or glitch to improve your levels in the game. Make sure to complete as many quests as possible, and don't get fixated on the main storyline.

They all have unique requirements and schedules, so it can be hard to figure out how to attract certain ones. 


My Melody’s Grandparents are two such visitors. They are a lovely elderly couple who visit every four weeks, and they’re not all that difficult to attract once you know how. Here’s everything you need to know to get them to your Cabins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a lot to be impressed about with Avowed, from its vividly hued fungal world to its ever-changing combat system. For me, it has to be the tarp physics, a simple yet effective mechanic that instills more realism in this dark fantasy world.


I've gone through my fair share of jumping on tarps in video games, and without fail, it's usually gone through the character as if they have somehow turned into a ghost. But to my surprise, Avowed has a much different approach where it actually reacts to your touch, waving around and making you slip just like it would in real life. And, if you time it right, it'll cause a tear and eventually rip apart to cause a scene in the Living Lands' market districts. There's even a ripping sound as a cherry on top.

Wish me mell is a character that you’ll only be able to meet once you’ve unlocked Merry Meadow, which you’ll get to via leveling up your friendship with Pompompurin. Once you’ve met Wish me mell, you’ll need to start leveling up your friendship because opening up more of Merry Meadow relies on it.

We are quickly closing in on Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma's 30th May release date and, with love in the air this Valentine's Day, publisher Marvelous! has shared a pair of new trailers to introduce the game's romance candidates.
Broken into 'Meet the Bachelors' and 'Meet the Bachelorettes,' the trailers showcase all 16 (yes, sixteen) romance options for the upcoming Rune Factory RPG. As you'd hope, every candidate seems to pack a dramatic backstory and lofty ambitions, with their titles spanning the full range of ridiculousness from the relatively tame 'Wandering Hero' to 'Prestigious God of Light and the Heavens" — damn, we know which one we'd rather add to our LinkedIn.

At the end of last year, Falcom announced that it was working on a Switch remaster of the 2012 PS Vita title Ys Memoire: Memories of Celceta (in Japan, at least). Well, what do you know, that very remaster now has a release date of 22nd May 2025 (thanks, Gematsu).
Yes, this one isn't confirmed for a Western release at the time of writing, but seeing how Oath in Felghana ended up getting localised around two years after its Japanese release, we'd wager that it will get an international launch at some point in the future.

When they got hold of detailed audience data for Civilization 6, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, Sid Meier's Civilization VII's new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.

This review was originally published in May 2014. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

Although Wario's core platforming series has been overshadowed for years by the surrealist microgames of WarioWare, his excellent platformers have the sort of devoted following that inspires 600-page eBooks.

Sometimes a blossoming genre can be obvious, as when a huge success like Doom or Dark Souls comes along and inspires games for decades to follow. But sometimes a new genre is quiet, low-key, hiding just beneath the surface of a tumultuous industry. Sometimes you have to go fishing for it.

The 28th annual DICE Awards ceremony has recently taken place in Las Vegas, and though Astro Bot robbed Nintendo of any potential wins (perhaps deservedly, to be honest – it's a bloomin' good game), there were a few notable nods toward a couple of outstanding indie titles available on Switch.
Those games are Balatro and Animal Well. The former took home three awards, including 'Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year', 'Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game', and 'Mobile Game of the Year', while the latter won the award for 'Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction'.

This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla Elden Ring. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro and Bloodborne reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.

This highly anticipated life-sim has felt like a long time coming. Initially announced in the 2023 February Direct, The Girl Who Steals Time was billed for a release later that year before being pushed to Summer 2024. This date then moved to October '24, before a further delay moved things to an April 2025 window. Phew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed has more The Outer Worlds DNA in it than just the Obsidian link, and from a technical perspective, that might be worrisome – the latter RPG’s Spacer’s Choice Edition was one of the most wretchedly broken releases of 2023.
Happily, Avowed does at least launch in much better shape, and with some genuinely fetching fantasy visuals that may even justify flicking on ray tracing. The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to "come hither" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. Asteroid 2024 YR4 loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.


If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

Remedy's exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as "completely abrupt and impersonal". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

It'll be a small one, about the size of one of the haunted houses that make up the co-op horror's roster of cosier locations. And that decision to build small is going to be the plan from now on. No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.

He Is Coming, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike RPG. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

Not a "play your way" in sight. Nary a "the only limit is your imagination". Absent a venomous and detestable "easy to learn, hard to master". Just a bloke named Ben, and a hole named hole.

Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week is the week of Valentine's Day, and therefore theoretically the most romantic week of the year even though it's still winter here and the drizzle feels like it's falling inside my bones and the thought of another human's touch makes me want to wipe myself with sandpaper.
Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well. Let's commence feeding the Maw and hope that we strike a few sparks of amore from the creature's heaving flanks.

That never happened for me with music critic Neil Kulkarni, though I must have read his work given the music magazines he wrote for. That changed a couple of weeks ago when I went to Kieron's (RPS in peace) newsletter in search of his piece in rememberance of J Nash (included in a prior Papers), in which he linked to his similar piece on Kulkarni, who passed last year. I read the examples of Kulkarni's work that Kieron linked, and then the Kulkarni articles the man himself linked, and several hours and several layers deep, I thought: oh no, Neil Kulkarni was one of my guys.

Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that Grand Theft Auto 6 is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia RTX 5080 is out! Kind of. In theory. If you can find one. But here’s the thing: it's basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio's employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel Smite 2 as a free-to-play beta. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Finally, I thought, I would have time for some of the recent blockbusters I'd not yet played: Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and more would fill those dusty days and nights in the taint of 2024.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. "I don't know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench's games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever," responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

It's a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind Forgotton Anne - one of my favourites from 2018. Forgotlings, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a Steam demo. This is such good news I've basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game's creator Venris on YouTube. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As rumoured, The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke "all roadmaps lead to Rome".* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.
