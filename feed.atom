        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like the upcoming open-world FPS Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is getting another delay. Originally scheduled to be released in 2022, the shooter now has a tentative release date of September 5, 2024. According to a video by developer GSC Game World announcing the release date, this is the "final" release date.




Detailing the decision, GSC indicated that thousands of players got the opportunity to play Stalker 2 for the first time during Gamescom 2023. After some playtests, GSC felt the game needed a little more time on the technical side of things. Originally the team was dedicated to releasing Stalker 2 in early 2024, but certain technical issues have popped up triggering the new delay.


It's always a bummer when a game gets delayed, especially a highly anticipated one like Stalker 2. But with so much hype around this sequel, it's certainly important for the team to get things just right. The developers have also had a myriad of challenges impacting the development process, so it's very understandable that the game has taken a bit longer than expected to release.


Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is now set to release on September 5, 2024 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

No reason was given for the nearly two-week delay, but the Pokémon Company did drop a new trailer to help make the wait a bit less painful. 




Pokémon Horizons: The Series now begins streaming on March 7


Netflix confirmed that the new premiere date for Pokémon Horizons in the U.S. is Thursday, March 7. It's only a 13-day delay, but still a delay nonetheless. Eager fans ready to continue on with the anime series will have to wait a wee bit longer. 


As for the new Pokémon Horizons trailer, it's really just more of what we've already seen. We're teased with the new lead duo of Liko and Roy in the Kanto region. There are mysterious pendants, new friends and foes, and of course, fresh Pokémon to catch. 


We'll journey along with you when Pokémon Horizons: The Series begins streaming March 7.

Rockstar Games, the juggernaut behind the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is fiercely protective of its IP and image, and so is its parent company, Take-Two Interactive.
So much so, in fact, that the latter has filed a trademark dispute over Remedy Entertainment's new logo, revealed back in April 2023. As reported by RespawnFirst (thanks, VGC), Take-Two believes that the new logo bears too much of a resemblance to Rockstar's iconic 'R' logo, stating "there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public".

That free update is now upon us, miladies and milords. Available January 25th, it's called High Tides, and introduces two new playable factions with their own units and gods and some additional campaign mechanics. Here’s a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-16T17:07:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zigurrat and Poppy Works have released a free add-on for Quake based on the upcoming game Slave Zero X. More than just a beefy slice of marketing, Slave Zero X Episode Enyo is a mod that serves as a prequel to the main game’s narrative.


The mod boasts six levels, eight weapons, and an original soundtrack. You play as one of the main antagonists from Slave Zero X, the eponymous Enyo. She’s out to assassinate Sovereign Khan, or “SovKhan,” as his friends call him.




The press release pushes the fact that the add-on can run on Nightdive’s remastered version of Quake. It’s available directly through the add-ons menu, so you can download and play it on consoles as well as PC. However, they’ve also released it standalone to be run on the various Quake source ports.


I have to say, it’s a pretty big flex to promote your game with a Quake mod. I’ve played a bit of it myself, and it’s not a quick hack job. Its levels are pretty elaborate, and while you can recognize some assets from the base game, it’s mostly all new. More importantly, however, it shows an understanding of Slave Zero X’s audience. I was initially keeping the game in my peripherals, not really paying it much mind, but now it’s firmly in my sights. I’m curious how it will tie into this Quake mod.


The title itself is a prequel to 1999’s Slave Zero for Dreamcast and PC, and while I don’t think you need any familiarity to get into Poppy Works’ new title, an affection for it certainly helps.


Slave Zero X releases on February 21, 2024 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch. Episode Enyo is available now for Quake.

Contain, for one, is due to release in beta form on January 16, and it is trying to combine Control, SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect), and Ready or Not into one.


Shoving experimental New Weird storytelling techniques into a tactical FPS envelope is, naturally, a rigmarole in and of itself, but Contain appears to be trying to go a step further still. Notably, the game features comprehensive gunsmithing and operator outfitting systems that appear to rival even those of Ground Branch and Escape from Tarkov. Talk about being prospective right off the bat.

Yesterday, Ubisoft launched a rebrand of its subscription service, Ubisoft+ Premium, and brought its Classics package to PC. Clearly, the company sees this as a step into the future of gaming as its director of subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, told GamesIndustry.biz that players need to become "comfortable" with the idea of not owning their games.
The Ubisoft+ Premium service offers access to new (and occasionally upcoming) games on Xbox, PC and Amazon Luna for a monthly fee that currently stands at £14.99 / $17.99. No, it doesn't affect the Switch for the time being, but it does point towards the company's future approach to sales.

The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the "final release date," indicating GSC Game World is confident it won't be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today's delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine's capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we've been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Movie adaptations of video games have proven themselves to be lucrative when done correctly. Martha is Dead is one of the next titles to get the treatment, and it may be one of the best choices. 


Martha is Death is developed by Italian studio LKA, and the live-action movie is being made in collaboration with Swedish film-production company Studios Extraordinaires. Much like the celebrated game, the film is set in World War 2, and it focuses on the sisters Martha and Giulia. What ensues next is a mystery that will leave your mind twisted and your hands trembling. 


In the press release, the publisher, Wired Productions, speaks a bit about how fitting Martha is Dead is for a film adaptation, especially due to its "gripping narrative and unique setting" managing director Leo Zullo states. We can expect something a little more special than usual, as the project is being co-directed by André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson who specialize in" crafting high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games."


Ambition is high for this project, and both Hedetoft and Troedsson wish to create something that offers both "fans and newcomers a cinematic tour-de-force, while staying true to the game’s soul-stirring essence."


Martha is Dead's film adaptation has yet to receive a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 bit studios gave a glimpse of the upcoming survival city-builder Frostpunk 2 with a gameplay reveal trailer. The developer and publisher also confirmed that the sequel will be released as a Day One on Game Pass title.  Frostpunk 2 will originally launch on PC in the first half of 2024—where it will be available on Game Pass for PC—followed by a later release on Xbox Series X|S—and Xbox Game Pass—as well as PlayStation 5.




Three Decades Later


The gameplay reveal looks similar to what we saw during a preview event a few months ago, highlighting the shift of focusing on a small ramshackle community from the original Frostpunk to building a sprawling post-apocalyptic city. Rather than placing each building individually, players will now district out areas similar to what you'd see in Cities: Skylines focusing more on the bigger picture.


Even though the Earth is still ravaged by a seemingly never-ending blizzard, the harsh environment is no longer the biggest threat. Taking place 30 years after the original, humanity has learned to adapt to its new reality for better or worse. However, players will have to manage a new threat: humanity itself.


No longer desperate just to survive, human nature has once again led people to chase an unsatiated thirst for power. Players will have to manage the demands of various factions, trying to keep everyone happy while doing what's best for the city.


Frostpunk 2 is shaping up to look like a fine successor to the original, keeping its bleak and intense setting while also being its own thing. I'm looking forward to keeping the generator running when it releases in the first half of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During an interview with Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida, the Final Fantasy XIV director and XVI producer has revealed that he thinks it might be better for a younger generation of developers to pick up the mantle and work on Final Fantasy XVII. 


While Final Fantasy fans have become very fond of Naoki Yoshida through his work on both FF XIV and XVI, he has implied that while the team at Square Enix have made no decision about a director for the next title in the series.




In the Game Maker's Notebox interview with Sony's Shuhei Yoshida, which can be viewed in its entirety here, Naoki Yoshida said: 


"For the moment, I'll just say that nothing has been decided yet. That said, if I had to say something about that... I've had the chance to work on two of these, XIV and XVI, so maybe it's time for someone new, you know. Instead of having the same old guys handle the next one.”


Yoshida went on to state his reasoning, saying that a younger generation would be able to make a new Final Fantasy title with challenges that "suit today’s world."


It will likely be a long time before we hear any concrete news about Final Fantasy XVII, but Square Enix is busy working on both Final Fantasy XIV, with Dawntrail coming this summer, and Final Fantasy XVI, with a new story-based DLC in the works and the PC version coming at some point.

Remember Steel Empire for the Sega Mega Drive? What about the GBA release? 3DS? Well, whichever one you've experienced, if any, you'll be happy to know that an updated version dubbed The Legend of Steel Empire is about to drop for the Nintendo Switch on January 23rd, 2024.
Boasting updated visuals and improved controls, The Legend of Steel Empire will receive a boxed and digital release, with physical copies available via retailers like Amazon for £24.99. Looking at the short trailer for the new release, we've got some short comparisons between the game on Mega Drive, GBA, and the HD port. While it certainly looks like a significant step up in visual quality, it's nice to see that the core pixel art aesthetic remains intact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As reported by RespawnFirst, Take-Two, the parent company of Rockstar Games, has filed a trademark dispute against Remedy Entertainment over the latter’s new logo.


The application was made in April 2023, shortly after Remedy revealed their new logo, and appears to still be ongoing as of writing. It currently looks like Take-Two has not followed through with a lawsuit, and it’s unclear if they have any intention of doing so. It seems more like Take-Two is trying to pre-emptively protect their claim to, uh… the capital R.


Take-Two has been aggressive in protecting its trademarks in the past, including over the use of the letter R in a logo and merely the word “Rock Star.” This kind of stands out since it’s against the developer of Alan Wake 2, which won many awards last year and is in the public consciousness.


Another notable example of this is the 2021 co-op title, It Takes Two. The developer of that game had to drop their trademark on the name after Take-Two disputed its use of the words “Take(s) Two”.


It’s also, in my opinion, ridiculous. The logos aren’t really that similar. They both feature a long capital R, and that’s about it. The fonts are different, they’re stylized in different ways, and the Rockstar logo has a star on it. I’m more likely to get Rockstar confused with Rockstar Energy Drinks, which apparently are unrelated. But then, Take-Two sometimes waves the trademark stick at PepsiCo, as well.


Again, this application may not go anywhere, but Remedy still has to oppose it if they want to maintain the trademark on their logo.

After the release of Hockenheim in December, in comes the Daytona International Speedway, at long last.


More broadly, new race tracks are the most notable repeat additions to Forza Motorsport's selection of content following its October launch window. Almost every major new patch has introduced a new track so far, and with Daytona coming in as part of Update 4 later today, on January 16, this seems poised to continue. Sadly, the rest of Update 4's content roster is way more transient after all.

The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

This might make me a massive hypocrite. It's a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don't know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it's doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it's sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game has a lot riding against it, and it has to go the extra mile to prove its excellence. The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered isn’t in the worst position pre-launch, although it has a steep hill ahead of it to prove why it should exist at all. Staying true to its history, Naughty Dog manages to not disappoint, and delivers a package filled with upgrades and a few surprises. 


The studio didn’t have to try too hard to sway me in its direction regarding the game. The Last of Us Part 2 sits up there as one of my favorite games of all time, and around the announcement of the remaster, I was already easing into another playthrough, which I excitedly put on pause to cleanse my palette for this new offering. 


Despite this, I could sense that my perception might not be the norm, and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foamstars isn't unique, but it does offer a colorful, exciting shooter experience. An announcement trailer has revealed that the game launches on Sony's console's on February 6. 


We got a taste of the game last year thanks to the open beta which ran from September 29 until October 1, and it was generally well-receieved. You'd be forgiven for confusing the Square Enix-produced open world beta with Nintendo's Splatoon franchise, as both games feature players making a colorful mess. 


However, Foamstars presents itself as a more action-packed party with options to fight solo or team up in 4x4 battles. The foam isn't there for aesthetic reasons alone. You can also use it to slide on, build with it, and much more. 




Only time will tell whether this is the iconic shooter Sony has been searching for. As a bonus, PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download the game for free from launch until March 4.

Yes, a live-action Minecraft movie is really happening. We know Jason Momoa is involved. We know Jack Black is involved. And, as of today, we know that director Jared Hess wants to get it right — or, at least, not get it wrong (thanks, Eurogamer).
In a recent interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Hess confessed that the production team is keen to "avoid an 'Ugly Sonic' situation" with the upcoming live-action movie — a reference to the blue blur's original design that debuted in the 2019 Sonic The Hedgehog trailer before being swiftly scrapped thanks to the ensuing online backlash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morrowind is just one of those games I'll always go back to. While Skyrim reigns supreme as the most successful Elder Scrolls game, the third installment in Bethesda's series still draws me in. And that's to say nothing about the mods that keep it alive.


For example, if I wanted to release my inner creativity, I could opt for "Write Books and Scrolls," a seemingly simple download that lets you loose on the blank pages of Morrowind.


Image via MomokeCome/Nexus Mods.


Brought to us by Nexus Mods user MomokeCome, it allows players to write their own scrolls and books within the world of TES3. Blank versions can be purchased from sellers, at which point you can put quill to paper and "write your own title and text."


Eat your heart out, Salman Rushdie


Okay, maybe I'm over-romanticizing it a bit. But when it comes to fantasy RPGs, not many people think to allow someone to become an in-game writer. We're all about having immense stories with rich lore, but this mod gives us the chance to craft some of our own.


The download page doesn't say whether the blank scrolls and books come with character or word limits, though. Anyone who's played Morrowind and has checked out the sheer breadth of literature available will know that some novels and history books can go on for a few pages.


I could wax lyrical about how I would use the mod to pen the great Elder Scrolls tale. Truth is, I'd probably just use it to remind my character to pick up more ash yams while in Balmora.

        <updated>2024-01-16T14:30:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week ago, I told you about how MIS was the next tech firm to be gunning for Steam Deck's title in the portable PC market, with a device called The Claw. Well, it seems the company is thinking long, long term, with some newer versions of this yet-to-be-released system on the horizon.


In a recent interview with IGN, System Product Managing Director Clifford Chun discussed The Claw, saying that MSI began developing it two years ago. Additionally, this is just one of a possible four models of the device that are "already in the pipeline."




Details are scarce, as you would imagine, but it seems the team is anticipating the release of numerous versions as the technology allows for it. When asked about potential release dates, Chun says it "depends on, for example, the CPU or a graphic upgrade down the road," adding that we should anticipate what MSI will release next.


Has anyone made a Liar, Liar joke yet?


While it's tough to say whether Valve should be quaking in its proverbial boots, The Claw is yet one more in a line of Steam Deck competitors.


We've already had offerings from ASUS with its ROG Ally, and Lenovo released its Legion Go last November. Where The Claw may differ slightly is in its hardware, which is actually making use of the Intel Arc GPU technology.


Whether this will set it apart from the others remains to be seen at this stage (it's still using Windows 11, much like the ROG Ally and Legion Go). The Claw is set to release sometime this year. Who knows what other companies will be preparing their own mobile PC device by then. Oh wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX Remix is already proving popular with modders, as notable games are being given a new, shiny lease on life. As a result, we're getting to see things like GTA, Max Payne, and early Tomb Raider games get something of a spit polish, re-entering our collective consciousness.


I have DSO Gaming to thank for this. A number of recent posts from them show that RTX Remix is able to put a bit of a modern spin on some older releases, such as the aforementioned ones.




In one article, we're treated to screenshots from a remixed version of Vice City – complete with Path Tracing – from user PC_Focus. We also have the above footage from turnpike, whose take on the original Max Payne gives the antihero's coat a nice sheen. Then there's skurtyyskirts, with a remixed version of the first Tomb Raider installment, showing Lara in a new light (literally).


The gaming equivalent of "rewind!"


Given that Nvidia is due to release its RTX Remix toolkit into open beta on January 22, we can expect to see more of this sort of thing happening. The above examples were done in the current version of the modding software, which means they might be improved upon even more at some point.


We've also seen the effect of it working in games like Half-Life 2, so it's not just suitable for ultra retro titles (although HL2 is turning 20 this year. Yikes, indeed).


Being able to inject modern techniques into classics, including ray tracing, image upscaling through the likes of DLSS, and more doesn't change how these games look or play overall. It gives them a fresh coat of paint and updated visuals, but they aren't remakes or even remasters. What they are, however, is a glance at just how far gaming technology has come over the years.

Despite trade-ins and pre-owned sales being one of the core pillars for the UK specialist retailer GAME for many years, recent reports have indicated that the firm will be ending physical trade-ins next month on February 16th, 2024.
So far, GAME itself has kept schtum on the matter, while staff from multiple UK branches revealed the drastic change on the down-low. As such, the reasoning behind the decision is currently unknown, but with digital game sales on the up and up, it stands to reason that many customers simply don't own as many physical games in the first place anymore. Plus, GAME will need to free up shelf space for those Funko toys, Sonic slippers, and heat-changing Halo mugs, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced on Ubisoft+'s news page, the company is renaming its subscription service. Now, when you're telling your friends about Ubisoft+ Multi-Access and PC Access, you should call it Ubisoft+ Premium instead. 


There's another surprise - a new subscription service is on the way. Dubbed Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, it is meant to provide "a curated selection of popular back-catalog and live games." which includes games like Far Cry 6, Rainbow Six Seige, and Watch Dogs: Legions.


With Ubisoft+ Premium, you get day one and sometimes even early access to the company's latest games. Of course, you're also able to play Ubisoft's extensive library of titles. Ubisoft Premium+ has a subscription fee of $17.99 while you can grab the Classic+ subscription for $7.99 per month.

Philippe Tremblay discusses Ubisoft subscription services


Ubisoft's director of subscription Philippe Tremblay naturally praised the services in the announcement. He revealed that subscribers have enjoyed "600 million hours of play" and the company is "above projection in terms of subscribers joining the program." 


As for what games are being played, Tremblay claims that Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six take the lead. Things never remain static, however, and "Assassin's Creed Mirage and The Crew Motorfest quickly made their way into the top five in the past couple of months."


You probably won't be surprised to learn that subscriptions help introduce players to games they may have otherwise never touched. As Tremblay highlights, "one in 10 subscribers is someone who has never played a Ubisoft game before." 


He also confirms that the name change will not change anything for current customers: "PC subscribers will keep their plan as is, with the same monthly price point that they are enjoying right now."


What's in a name? In this case, not too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Make the designs cool".
Masahiro Sakurai has released a new YouTube video looking into the concept of customisation in video games.
It's not the most groundbreaking stuff imaginable and it will likely only truly resonate with budding game developers. Still, since Sakurai has announced that he will be winding down his YouTube channel this year, we're making the most of it, dagnabbit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having spent what feels like an entire lifetime in JRPG Persona 5 Royal, going back to the original Persona 3 is pretty jarring. It's unsurprising given it came out 18 years ago, but exploration is more akin to a slideshow and dungeon-running to a well-rehearsed routine.
But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3's  remake felt immediately familiar. It's absolutely built for a seamless transition for P5-likers and takes away some of P5 Royal's learnings, too. Unless something disastrous happens when Reload fully releases, I can't ever see myself returning to the original.

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I've described it to folks as "Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal." While that may be a gross oversimplification, it's also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it's been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

Well, that's exactly what early access co-op FPS Contain is going for, where four of you gear up in tactical clobber and clear corners of military chumps and anomalous… rumps? It's a mixture of Rainbow Six, a bit of Stalker, and maybe a touch of Control, with gameplay showing real promise. It's also got me thinking about unexpectedly scary moments in shooters, too.

That title is… Dawnwalker. They’ve also shared a new teaser image, which I think could depict one of two things: a) a vampiric or otherwise supernaturally-inclined hero flying through the air care of a Dishonored-style Blink teleport, sword raised and clawed fingers stretched towards an unseen foe against a blood-red backdrop. Or b) a man with his trousers aflame swinging through the window of a second floor spa while attempting to use his umbrella as a parachute, having received only half a pedicure before the building caught fire.

You look through your list of potential household hazards and select the right one, so your caller gets sent the info on dealing with cockroaches. Except as your week at HSH goes on, your calls start to be less roaches, more "my house smells like death and my dog is acting strangely" or "I can see someone looking through my window at night and hear them breathing heavily."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.]]></summary>

After Ubisoft admitted to being "disappointed" by the launch sales of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope last year, it looks like the sleeper sequel's luck has been somewhat on the turn in the ensuing period.
A new report from VGC claims that Mario's tactical follow-up is, in fact, knocking on the door of three million sales which, according to the outlet, puts the game's performance roughly in line with its predecessor (Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle) for the time since launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans' appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.]]></summary>

Like Bluetooth, printers are against God’s wishes, violating universal laws on such a level that they must be forced not to work in ever-more impossibly unlikely ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, winner of Destructoid’s prestigious “game on Zoey Handley’s favorites of 2023 list,” uh, award, will be getting a heap of free content this year, according to a tweet from BigZ Studios CEO Zane Lofton.


You might be asking, “How could you possibly make Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer even better?” You probably can’t, but you can add some extra toppings. Zane says that the update will include new maps, enemies, bosses, cutscenes, and a new weapon. Those are all great things to have more of.




Released in June 2023, Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is a spin-off of Hypnospace Outlaw. Like its progenitor, Slayers X aims to accurately capture a specific and awkward part of technology’s history. It is presented as a mod for a late ‘90s shooter made by one of the more central characters of Hypnospace Outlaw. In the process, not only does it manage to present the charm of that era of mods, but it also works incredibly well as a narrative character piece, exploring its central protagonist indirectly through a product of their imagination.


While I didn’t pick an individual Game of the Year, I did state that it would have gone to Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer. As someone with a high opinion of their own opinion, that’s high praise. Immediately after spending so much time writing about it for year-end, I immediately dove back in for another playthrough, and couldn’t help but admire how right I am. It’s really an incredible title. The game is good too!


Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

It's probably officially too far into January to get away with saying Happy New Year now, but stuff it, I'll wish you a good one anyway, as well as a warm welcome back to Letter From The Editor. This month's letter can be considered very much a part two to the one I wrote in November, in which we had a sneaky peek at the behind the scenes process of putting together our annual RPS Advent Calendar (or in regular video game website speak, our big games of the year feature). 
We always have a big old voting barney around November time to decide which games do or don't make the cut in our Advent Calendar (that is: we all submit top ten lists and we count up the votes afterwards), and every year lots of you try and guess which ones will make it over on the RPS Discord. Inevitably, there are only so many slots for what is always a heck of a lot of games put forward, but the key question has always been thus: who voted for what? WELL. For the first time ever, come and find out below as we reveal all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner, hitting PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29. Game Informer has been covering it all month long as the game graced the cover of our latest magazine issue, and you can read all of our exclusive Final Fantasy VII Rebirth coverage here. But, with little over a month to go until the game's release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this "Destined for Rebirth" trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game's excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it's pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth "Destined for Rebirth" trailer for yourself below: 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PS5 on February 29, 2024. 
For more about the game, read our feature about the making of Final Fantasy VII Remake, and then read about how the chaotic development of Final Fantasy VII changed the course of the franchise. After that, check out what Square Enix told Game Informer about Zack Fair's expanded role in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-four-years-of-work-shiren-the-wanderer-4-plus-for-psp-gets-a-fan-translation/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=after-four-years-of-work-shiren-the-wanderer-4-plus-for-psp-gets-a-fan-translation"/>
        <updated>2024-01-15T16:14:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2012 PSP title, Fushigi no Dungeon: Fuurai no Shiren 4 Plus: Kami no Hitomi to Akuma no Heso has received an English fan translation thanks to some intrepid fans. Now simply called Shiren the Wanderer 4 Plus: The Eye of God and the Devil’s Navel, the patch is available for download now.


The Shiren the Wanderer series is one of the many branches of Chunsoft’s eternal Fushigi no Dungeon series, which started on the Super Famicom with 1993’s Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon, a spin-off of Dragon Quest IV. Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Furai no Shiren was the standalone follow-up to that. They were roguelites before roguelite was even defined as a distinct sub-genre.


Whether or not we received a game in the Fushigi no Dungeon series in North America has always been rather scattershot. The Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games are generally a safe bet, but we were passed by for a lot of Shiren the Wanderer games. For example, Shiren the Wanderer 4 was never localized. It was originally released in 2010 on the DS before getting this upgrade “Plus” port on the PSP in 2012.


If you’ve never played a game in the Mystery Dungeon series, they’re roguelite dungeon crawlers. I’ve personally only picked away at the surface of a few of the titles, but I think it’s about time to change that. If you’re interested in taking the dive but don’t want to mess around with fan translations, the newest entry, Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil, is coming to Switch in North America February 27, 2024.


Otherwise, if you want to try this translation of Shiren the Wanderer 4 Plus by fans SharkSnack, Arc Impulse, and Kotcrab (and some additional contributors), it’s available right over here.

Set in 1918, it puts you in charge of a field hospital in northern France, a few minutes drive from the frontline. Here’s how all that works: casualties arrive from the trenches by ambulance or stretcher, and are carried by your medics to a clearing station, where nurses look after them before they’re seen by a doctor. Patients may be lightly or severely injured, but they will all eventually die if they’re left unattended.

Since this article was originally published back in November 2021, the Switch Online Expansion Pack offering has expanded with a decent spread of N64 classics — 26 in total at the time of writing. From the games on our initial wishlist, 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, GoldenEye 007, Jet Force Gemini, Mario Party 3, Pilotwings 64, and Wave Race 64 have all launched on the subscription service.
That's a tidy selection, but there are still plenty of 64-bit gems we'd love to see come to NSO. Therefore, we've overhauled the article below, removing the arrivals and fleshing out the wishlist with some new, equally deserving candidates. We've also added a new poll at the end — let us know which of these you'd most like to see come to Switch.

It's cool! It reminds me a lot of Legends Of Kyrandia, in that it doesn't need to explain why stuff in the world is like it is, it just is. Big talking fish? Sure. Skull floating in space? You betcha.
Twilight Oracle isn't immune to the kind of counter-intuitive puzzle solves that are sort of inherent to the genre (use pineapple on wallet, etc.), but there's a demo to see for yourself, and I thought it'd be just as well to make more of you aware of it before it comes out on the 30th of January. Also because I wanted to point out that one of the reasons I have been enjoying Twilight Oracle is the colour.

Although the critically acclaimed Metroid Dread was primarily developed by Spanish studio MercurySteam, Nintendo itself was heavily involved in the game's creation and marketing, as you'd expect.
Like many major releases on the Nintendo Switch, Metroid Dread also benefitted from the launch of amiibo, with a Samus/E.M.M.I dual pack available alongside the game itself. Nintendo developer Uenaka Minoru has recently spoken on the creation of the amiibo via a recruitment page and how his studies in 'artistic anatomy' at graduate school helped inform the overall look of the figures (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital pre-orders are now available.
Vanillaware's upcoming tactical RPG, Unicorn Overlord, might have been one of the more low-key announcements of the September 2023 Nintendo Direct, but with publisher Atlus releasing a new trailer today, we can confirm that it still looks stunning.
Titled 'Josef's Guide to Exploration', the latest trailer is unsurprisingly all about the upcoming game's exploration features, with the titular knight instructing Unicorn Overlord's protagonist, Alain, on what he (and by extension, we) can expect to find in the world of Fevrith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the sheer quantity of games releasing on Steam these days, having a neat little elevator pitch for your game can be vital in helping it stand out. For example, if I get an email saying a game is like "Obra Dinn meets such and such" or "Into The Breach but a deckbuilder", that's like personal catnip to me, and can be a handy indicator of whether I should investigate further - maybe watch a gameplay trailer for it, say, or see if it's got a demo. Case in point: this is exactly how I stumbled upon the upcoming Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer Windswept last week, although instead of an email, I saw it on the growing "Your game is too much like..." thread over on Xwitter - which is definitely worth a browse if you have very niche interests in need of a good scratch.

Because Ark: Survival Ascended developers Studio Wildcard and Grove Street Games are promising/threatening to "put the power of unbridled game creation directly in your hands" with the game's next major dev kit update, which will release by the end of January.
This will greatly expand the game's moddability, though concrete details are thin on the ground. It'll ship with a "Mario-inspired" platformer to show you how. There's also a dev kit update planned next week for multiplayer spin-off Ark: The Survival Of The Fittest. This will allow you to "sculpt the ultimate battlegrounds where your fellow ARK survivors will fight to see who will be the ultimate survivor".

Within the genre, there’s a really specific sub-genre that I’ve recently found myself enjoying maybe a little too much — hidden cat games. And I think I’ve found the best one out there, especially for those who grew up gaming. 


An Arcade Full of Cats

An Arcade Full of Cats is a free-to-play game developed by DevCats that revolves around a suspiciously ‘Back to the Future’ looking pair of cats called Fofiño and Leo. In order to make the world a better place for cats (and humans), they go back in time to inject more cats into our most beloved arcade games. There is no combat, no time restrictions and nothing more taxing than… Finding cats. I know, it sounds bizarre at best, but it’s more than that.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retroware has officially announced the Programancer developed The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest, a side-scrolling action game based on the questionable Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest. It’s coming to PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox sometime in 2025.


Some people like the game and that’s okay, but Simon’s Quest is the sort of game I put up on the autopsy table to dissect it to find what went wrong. There’s definitely worse on the NES, but it’s pretty difficult to find a worse game in the Castlevania series. Uh, hmm… Let’s try. Maybe one of the early computer ports. How’s the DOS version?




Anyway, it had some good ideas mixed in there, and that seems to be what The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest seems to look to evoke. It has an “optional” nonlinear progression and a day/night cycle. The graphics take a similar (but less drab) aesthetic, with the main character in particular being extremely reminiscent of Simon Belmont.


But this isn’t Simon Belmont; it’s legally distinct Simon Belmont named Simon Quest. There are minigames, customizable difficulty, and “Richter slide kicking.” Technically, I think he got the sliding thing from Maria Renard, but I’m being pedantic. Mr. Quest is jealous that his rival, Stan Helsing, defeated legally disti… oh, no, it’s just Dracula. So, he travels around trying to revive Dracula so he can beat him, too. Sounds like a great idea.


Looks great. Castlevania is one of my favorite game series, and I feel like we haven’t gotten the stiff, stompy, classic style of the series for a long time. Maybe Konami will hand the license to someone who will do it justice, but for now, we can drown our sorrows in The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest.


Or, we can when The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest launches in 2025 to PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has already laid out their update schedule for Starfield in 2024, which includes updates every six weeks beginning in February. There's an update coming before that, however, and arriving on the Steam beta branch next week. It won't add major new features but includes "over 100 fixes and improvements".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dominions 6 was announced last year, with promise that the latest iteration of the complex 4X god-battler would be thick with UI and quality-of-life improvements. I dared to dream of a game that was more accessible than Dominions 4, the last in the series I played. 

Well, it now has a release date of next Wednesday, January 17th, and there are videos that show it in action.

The latter is more interesting, because one of Blizzard's proposed solution is giving Tank and Damage heroes "a modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive", which would make them less reliant on Support players to heal everyone.

The winners were a castle-themed item pack and a Gothic-themed clothing pack. Thanks to Sims Community, we’ve got our first glimpse of one of them — the Castle Estate Kit!


The Sims community are not rookies when it comes to leaks - for almost every Pack or Expansion, there seems to be some kind of leaked information shortly before they’re released. Now, not even two weeks into 2024, we’ve received the first leak of the year with information about the first Pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though it's not everyone's cup of tea, Starfield certainly has made a name for itself among gaming audiences. The developer, Bethesda, is thankfully not dropping its post-launch updates anytime soon. The game's latest update is about to get a beta very, very soon, in fact.


As Bethesda promised late in 2023, Starfield is due to receive major, meaningful patches every six weeks or so in 2024. This improvement to the game's updating cadence won't be dropping in until sometime in February, but the good news is that Bethesda's plans for the interim update are more substantial than we might've expected. On top of the usual suite of bug fixing, for example, we're due to receive a whole assortment of graphical improvements to boot.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is, on its surface, a mobile game set in Capcom’s acclaimed Devil May Cry universe. However, to call Peak of Combat a Devil May Cry game is like calling Konami’s Pachinko machines the latest installment in Hideo Kojima’s stealth-action franchise. While it’s tempting to call gacha games like this trash based on the genre alone, Peak of Combat is a special kind of trash.

That may be a weird way to describe it, but I think what I’m trying to say is that it looks reminiscent of Valis. It’s a sort of grainy-looking side-scroller that feels like it was developed for an early Japanese home computer before being ported to the PC-Engine and finally landing on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. A drifting vagabond tied to no home. To clarify, that’s what Valis went through. The difference here is that El Viento was never on a platform aside from the Genesis, and the developer, Wolf Team, wasn’t behind the Valis games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could say that Alan Wake 2 was decades in the making. Last year’s blockbuster from Remedy saw the studio return to its roots and the horrors therein, dredging up the past to loop into something new, now. But it wasn’t just the main character or gameplay style we saw return, but the sounds and inspirations of the original Alan Wake too, bubbling up from Cauldron Lake through the music of Poe.


When I was playing Alan Wake 2, I was pleasantly surprised—maybe even a bit shocked—to hear a song that sounded like Poe between chapters. And a quick search later, I had verified as much: singer-songwriter Poe had collaborated with Remedy’s Sam Lake to record a new song, “This Road,” just for Alan Wake 2.


For fans of meta-textual works, this was an incredible piece of news. It felt like severa…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-12T20:05:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[8BitLegit has announced that Dead Tomb, a new NES game based on an old lost game, is soon to be released for Switch, Xbox, and the actual NES.


While Dead Tomb is a new NES game built from the ground up, it’s actually based on a game called Temporel Inc., which was a game for the Videoway, a very unique subscription-based content delivery system based out of Quebec, Canada. Among its features was the ability to play 8-bit games, which would be loaded into the system’s RAM, which, obviously, emptied once you were done.


Because no one actually owned the games that they were playing, and the service eventually shut down, there are no known copies of Temporel Inc. remaining. However, there was a recorded playthrough of the entire game, so fans were able to reverse-engineer and recreate it, first as a flash game and now as the NES remake, Dead Tomb. If you want more than a quick summation, Hardcore Gaming 101 has a fantastic write-up that covers everything in more detail.




It’s a pretty cool story, and it looks like a pretty cool game. It has you stranded in ancient Egypt, trying to escape from a pyramid. Its verb-based adventure style harkens back to the glory days of the LucasArts SCUMM Engine. It’s been developed by homebrew veterans Collectorvision (which owns the Acclaim brand).


Dead Tomb is coming to Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and NES. It will be available for preorder on all platforms on January 19, 2024. The modern console version will be released on January 26. The NES version is scheduled to ship in Q3 2024 but is limited to 300 copies.

Last year’s exceptional Paranormasight is definitely in the running, and 2024 is already looking promising thanks to the reveal of Kumitantei: Old-School Slaughter.

If you’re unfamiliar with Märchen Veil, isn’t that just the best? Not knowing about a game that was just reissued? I actually do know Märchen Veil because of the Famicom Disk System version released in 1987. I don’t own it, but it’s one of the cheapest and most common games on the system, so I always see a copy when I’m looking for new ones to try. I haven’t bought it simply because I was afraid of the language barrier.


I bring that up because I wondered how D4 Enterprise addressed the language barrier since the story is told through cutscenes with Japanese text. The …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-12T18:37:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After targeting iOS and Android devices in November, Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal has a new console on the hit list. The upgraded version of the 2006 stealth classic is coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop on January 25. 


Like the iOS and Android versions, the Switch iteration will see vast improvements over the initial title that launched on PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 in 2006. Some of which you may notice in the Switch release date trailer below.




Feral Interactive handled the iOS and Android ports of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, and they're taking care of the Switch version as well. The game's visuals haven't changed much since 2006, but there are a lot of quality-of-life features being introduced to make Agent 47 feel a bit more modern. 


Instinct Mode, something that was introduced to the Hitman series later on, is incorporated into Reprisal. It helps players out by highlighting important mission objectives and targets on the level's map so you have a clearer idea of what you're being tasked with and where you should be headed.


2006's Blood Money didn't have a mini-map for players to utilize, but Feral Interactive implemented one to aid moment-to-moment gameplay in Reprisal. It's dynamic too, showing instant feedback for Agent 47 as NPCs grow suspicious of his actions. 


The controls have been reworked too since the initial PlayStation 2 and Xbox/Xbox 360 releases of Blood Money. This will surely make playing through the stealth title's 12 replayable sandbox missions much smoother on Nintendo's hybrid console. 


While the iOS and Android versions of the game launched at $19.99, the Switch iteration of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal is being listed at $29.99 on the Nintendo eShop. But those who head over there and preorder before the game's January 25 release will earn themselves a 16% discount, knocking the overall cost down to $24.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Even more impressive, the PS5 sold better than any PlayStation console has ever sold since the PS2 in 2004. That’s also an…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk is a combination of words that screams "predatory mobile fantasy RPG" but that's very much not my takeaway from the game's demo. Out tomorrow on Steam for £10.23, $11.99 or €11.83 including the 20% launch discount, this first instalment in the Crystal Story series blends the cuddly feel of a 16-bit Zelda with the dream logic of a Yume Nikki. There's a splash of Undertale's crackpot experimentalism to the writing and certain battles, as well. 


Those are big comparisons to invoke, and I don't expect Crystal Story to measure up to them. But it's a lot better than I was expecting from a game whose title had me picturing microtransaction-sodden levelling systems and a pouty elf in a bikini.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have good news and bad news. Good news. My mum got me an incredible hot chocolate maker for Christmas this year, as well as a jumbo-sized box of grated chocolate sachets to use with it. It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she's ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat's Velvetiser, you're an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It's fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.
Bad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games' new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?

There's no release date for the sequel, but Titan Forge Games says it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Closed early alpha testing will begin this spring. 
The team says Smite 2 will feature a diverse roster of Gods from all sorts of mythological pantheons around the world, and while some playable gods will stay true to how they perform in Smite, others "will have new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities."

It's come some way since, but its edges are still a little rough, with (usually) minor bugs and limited feedback wrapped up in a design that's influenced, of course, by that vague shimmering ghost of Rogue (and thus is innately bad and you're all just wrong). So yeah, it kinda has problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.
Mercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to "Is this a good idea?" followed by "No."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golden Sun and its sequel, Golden Sun: The Golden Age are joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week. On January 17, these two classic Game Boy Advance games will be available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
If you haven't yet played them before, there's probably someone in your life who has. And there's a good chance they mention it a lot, for good reason, too. Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren't familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


"From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard," a press release reads. "Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks." 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you'd like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you're curious about that library, here's every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription. 
Are you going to check out the Golden Sun games next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

It's out 26th April 2024, and alternates beat 'em up action with cartoon tank customisation, in a sort of Dragon Ball X Mad Max homage with chunks of Dragon Quest thrown in for good measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Core Engage and Daedalic Entertainment have released a new overview trailer for New Cycle, their post-apocalyptic "dieselpunk" city management game. "New Cycle" is obviously a bit of a self-contradiction, and I suspect that's deliberate - one of the questions the video leaves you with is whether there is "a future beyond survival", or whether we are doomed to just repeat the processes of extraction and gradual building-up, resource overexploitation and encroaching disaster suggested by these 12 jam-packed minutes of in-game footage.

The reframing of copyright infringement as fraud in recent years means that pirate sites may find themselves vulnerable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took all of one turn before the insults started flying in our Solium Infernum multiplayer preview session this week. Specifically, they'd been launched straight into the court of League Of Geeks co-founder and studio director Trent Kusters, who was attempting to show us how the game's asynchronous multiplayer mode worked in a six-player match-up - the public playtest for which goes live today, Thursday January 11th, over on Steam. Moments earlier, he'd been walking myself, deputy editor Alice Bee and guides editor Ollie through the basics of this strategy game from hell, telling us about the importance of claiming territory, seeking out places of power to bolster our domain, and how to do battle with our hive-like legion units. But just as we were watching our individual turn orders play out, Kusters announced that Ollie had given him the digital equivalent of a demonic slap in the face, demanding he pay tribute to him, or else…
To his credit, Kusters took it with good humour. "This is the beautiful thing about this game - it's petty high school politics in Hell," he said laughing before graciously deciding to accept the insult at the cost of some of his prestige - the all-important hallmark of how you're perceived within this conclave of warring demons fighting for Satan's empty throne. Personally, I think Ollie's insult would have pierced my exceedingly thin skin instantly if I'd been in the same position, and I'd probably have been torn between declaring a vendetta against Ollie's unjustified affront, or challenging him to a Praetor duel to exact some (hopefully) righteous vengeance. Alas, since we were literally only a turn into this game, none of us were in any position to make good on those options, leaving the only possible outcome as eating it and moving on. It was a smart move on Ollie's part, and one that makes me both terrified and excited to see how our own team multiplayer sessions will play out in the run-up to Solium Infernum's full release on February 14th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed "AI Shark," it's now a software-agnostic program designed to provide "personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming." What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It's all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
"The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024."
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console's release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo's response, assuming it issues one.
For more Nintendo Switch, check out our episode of All Things Nintendo where we list our most anticipated Switch games, and then read up on how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown runs on the console.

It's good news for people playing the FromSoftware RPG on Steam Decks, especially those haunted by memories of the game's technical tribulations at launch, some of which were caused by the anti-cheat functionality. It's less great news for the millions hankering for the slightest whisper of new information about Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. But save your pity, above all, for the dozens of videogame news writers - dozens, I tell you! - who must write about Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC at any opportunity, lest the demigods of traffic eat our souls.

Shannon Woodward, the actress who originally portrayed Dina in The Last of Us Part 2, has responded to the live-action casting of Isabela Merced. In addition to a tweet of general support for Merced, Woodward responded to a fan who wondered why she didn't reprise her role in the sequel. In short, it's because of her age.

"Bcs [sic] I am... Much older lol," Woodward's second tweet reads. Much like Ellie's original actress, Ashley Johnson, Woodward is about 20 years older than the character she portrays. Dina's character model is actually based on an entirely different person, Cascina Caradonna, who fits the age range of the character.

The short answer is that it is solid. Playing on Switch does not feel like a major downgrade from the other versions. For the long answer, check out the video below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Prince Of Persia subtitles go, The Lost Crown is certainly an evocative one. It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They're all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I'd also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you'll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you're allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that's precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios' pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to pu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount+ released the first season of its live-action Halo series back in 2022 and while the initial premiere showed promise, the show was ultimately a letdown, both as the Chief's first foray into the live-action television space and as a Halo story. Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. 
I'm not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn't even finish the first season – but I'd be lying if I said this trailer didn't pique my interest. Perhaps I'm a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it's a combination of both. 
Check out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: 


Paramount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show's first season, so it's clear the streamer is committed to this property for now. Here's hoping the second season fairs better than the first. 
For more, read about Halo: The Series' showrunner's decision to show Master Chief's face in the show, and then read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. After that, check out this story about how Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries will develop Halo games "now and in the future" even after layoffs that happened at the studio last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re sick and tired of your DualSense controller dying after a measly three to six hours of use, it looks like Sony might be getting ready to release a new version of the PlayStation 5 controller that could double its typical battery life. That’s if a Canadian store listing is to be believed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reached the Elden Ring exhaustion point a couple of years ago… and I still don't think I've climbed out of my slump. Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it's one of FromSoftware's most taxing soulslike creations. It's so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I'd had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.
With talk of Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I've assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I'm not as excited as I would've been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.

"When a local farm in Patchwork, MT is attacked by a group of notorious bandits, Sheriff Sam Judge sets out to bring them to justice by any means necessary and save the hostage they have taken," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "But on his journey, through the mysterious motives of those he pursues, Sam finds himself transported to another world overrun with prehistoric creatures and dinosaurs and must fight for his life to make it back to earth." 
Check out the Son and Bone announcement teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, TeamKill Media is aiming to fill the Dino Crisis-sized hole left in action games right now, and we're here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s time for another pull on the velvet rope labelled “too many games”. In fairness, this time the argument is a touch more involved than perennial moaning about backlogs – to whit, “there are too many games and it’s all the pandemic’s fault”. Nacon’s head of publishing Benoit Clerc has argued that the Covid lockdown years have bred too much investment in new games, and that we’re currently reaping the results in the form of an unsustainable glut of releases.

Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 
Basically, it's the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It's an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022.

        <id>121822</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/11/retailer-listing-of-a-v2-dualsense-with-12-hour-battery-life-for-ps5-spotted-online"/>
        <updated>2024-01-11T13:01:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an "exceptional" 12-hour battery life. That's a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 
More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a "PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White," as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the "About This Product" section of the controller, you'll find, "Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions." This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that "offers easy click-in charging." 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it's real, and will update this story if it learns more. 
If you're interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge. And if you've ever wondered what it might be like to have a DualSense controller cut in half with a screen placed between the two halves, check out the PlayStation Portal.

It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.
Fortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up. It doesn't look like this will be an effective gambit in Digested, a bodycam horror game about being stuck on a barren, thinly forested and possibly irradiated island with a giant snake. Your tactical options seem to consist mostly here of running away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us' second season. This follows yesterday's news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show's second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix's Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for "Snooze" by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity's Triump, and Good Boy. 
We're so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can't wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren't alone either – The Last of Us' premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.

It's £100 off today, making the price of admission to the really big monitor show just £699. For about twice the price of a good 1440p 165Hz monitor, you get a monitor the size of two 1440p 165Hz monitors - but, critically, with no gap in the middle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark's upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It's a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark's chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

The company announced these layoffs in an internal memo sent out on Monday, January 8. These job cuts follow a turbulent 2023 for the company after it attempted to introduce per-install fees to developers using its game engine before later walking it back. 
Unity is expected to lay off 1800 people by the end of March and once complete, it will be the company's largest round of layoffs ever. It will be its fourth round of layoffs since July 2022, as noted by Yahoo! Finance. The job cuts are expected to affect all departments at Unity.

Like, okay, Scorsese, you can say you didn't really like Murder Mystery 2, the normies won't chase you out of town with pitchforks. You know what actually is a burden? Your passions being watching hours of anti-multi-level marketing (MLM) YouTube videos, which is the content hole I fell down over the Christmas break. Your weird uncles have at least seen a film before, but it's not like I can turn to my mum and ask her if she thinks the weird Monat Christians are worse than the Seint make-up TikTok girlies without explaining almost every word in the sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. 


Warp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.

Unfortunately, it seems this heartbreaking trend is continuing into this new year as yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Amazon-owned streaming company Twitch is set to lay off 500 employees, or about 35 percent of its staff. 
These layoffs follow two rounds of layoffs Twitch experienced last year. Bloomberg expects the layoffs to be announced today. As for why, the publication says running Twitch is extremely expensive and the company has struggled to financially get on top of the cost to support billions of hours of livestreamed content.

Players of the action-RPG/management hybrid on social media quickly did what people on social media do: demanded that they add sex. 

Its developers said they would and now we get to see what that means when the update launches on January 16th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It's also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

Remedy's Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game's villainous Entity.
Mind you, I'm a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight's universe, not Behaviour Interactive. "As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back," it reads. "Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key." Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation's Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019's Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We're thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!
https://t.co/BZRimbXww6
January 9, 2024
Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it's fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game's story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory's Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It's unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever been to Shinjuku station in Japan, you know what it's like to be transported to a dizzying realm of limbs and tickets and signage with myriad squiggly lines that make about as much sense as rainbow spaghetti that's been hurled at a white rectangle. You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I'd say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre's underpants. One act isn't the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur's Gate 3, which many players feel isn't a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG's first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act's "drastic" tone shift better in future releases. It's a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian's CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he's "figured out" the first act of Larian's next unannounced project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon's secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League exists at a strange intersection of gaming hype. On the one hand, obviously, we are and should be excited for Rocksteady's return to the Arkham Universe that it popularized through some of the greatest superhero games of all time. Obviously. But on the other hand, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deviates from so many of the conventions that made Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight so beloved. And so many of those conventions that Kill the Justice League embraces – such as a team-based, co-op inf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a sneaking affection for slightly jarring genre hybrids - games like the relatively recent Disintegration and the much older Battlezone 2, which smush action mechanics together with real-time strategy, or the rather more elegant Puzzle Quest, in which you roll around a parchment landscape fighting wizards using the power of match-3. New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You'll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.

Haddad told Variety that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it's the best-selling game of the year "in the entire industry worldwide." Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a small form factor PC is difficult. Not only do you have to find the perfect SFF case, but then you have to spec out all of the components to fit inside it - and miniaturised motherboards in particular often come at a premium, especially if you're building a current-gen system. 
Thankfully, right now Amazon UK is doing a great deal on ASRock's best Mini ITX motherboard for Ryzen 7000 CPUs, with a £146 asking price that comes 20% below its £187 RRP and more than £20 cheaper than the next-closest UK retailer.

In my case, that job sim  is Medieval Machines Builder, probably better known as Siege Weapon Builder.
Its free-to-play prologue goes live later this week, on top of a demo from last year. I haven't played either the prologue or the demo and who knows, they could be rubbish, but look, I had to spend three hours this morning queuing for an appointment, and all I wanted to do during those three hours was cobble together a trebuchet from plastic chairs and retractable tape. Let me do a quick 400 words on this? Pretty please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Square Enix revealed new information about Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV’s upcoming fifth expansion, during a fan event for the popular MMO. In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:


A new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.


Lastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. 


Last year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer. For more info, check out this primer breaking down everything you need to know about the expansion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.
The usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.

I have run this through our Chthonic Translator and the short version is that it wants to get down the gym now and then.
Some new game releases we are tip-toeing towards with our shields raised this week, in case they turn out to be Mimics: Allison Road-inspired horror Supernormal (8th Jan), free turn-based dungeon crawler Buriedbornes2 (10th Jan), medical management sim War Hospital (11th Jan), feudal Chinese spin-off Reigns: Three Kingdoms (11th Jan), pleasingly nonsensically-named retro RPG Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk (13th Jan).

Let me tell you, I have started off the new year anxious as heck, and despite insisting I wouldn't watch the Hootenanny (never the Hootenanny) I once again watched the Hootenanny. Jools loves his boogie woogie. I can't say for sure the two things - the angs and the boogie woogie - are related, but I wouldn't rule it out. You know what definitely soothes anxiety? Staring at a screen for hours and hours and not going outside or regulating your breathing! Here's what we're playing this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Final Fantasy VII launched on PlayStation in 1997, it revolutionized the RPG genre and gaming as a whole. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. 
For the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. "Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We're curious to see how the series follows up Season 1's dramatic conclusion. Season 2's cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the "opening movie," which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called "Full Moon Full Life." 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below:

After that, watch the newest episode of The Game Informer Show to find out why Persona 3 Reload is one of our most anticipated games of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the "hypertapping" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and "rolling," discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.
