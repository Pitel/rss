Bandai Namco has confirmed that its 2012 sword-swinger Soulcalibur V is to be delisted from digital storefronts next week. As of Monday, June 19, the fighting sequel and its DLC will no longer be available to purchase from the PlayStation and Xbox stores.
"Valiant Warriors - Soul Calibur V is taking its final curtain call on the stage of history and will be sunset on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 19, 2023," said the publisher on Twitter. "The base game and all associated DLC will no longer be available for purchase. Thank you for your continued support."
https://twitter.com/soulcalibur/status/1668075650299879424?s=20
While it was neither confirmed nor denied by Bandai Namco, it is assumed that all players who have purchased the title will still have access to the game. Soulcalibur V is not a backward-compatible game for modern platforms, nor is it a part of Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. As such, the delisting only affects the native PS3/Xbox 360 users. Better hold on to those discs, archivists.
The most recent entry in the franchise, Soulcalibur VI, launched in 2018 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An added golden epilogue
It's been just over a year since Square Enix released its HD-2D turn-based tactics game Triangle Strategy. And now, fans who have put some time into the tactics can get a little bonus for their trouble.
A Version 1.1.0 update has rolled out for Triangle Strategy on available platforms, adding a few different features. For those who want to re-experience the big events of Triangle Strategy, there are replay options for both chapters and story battles.
But also arriving as part of the update is an Extra Story option. This bonus chapter appears on the title screen, but only after you've completed the Serenoa route of Triangle Strategy.
If you haven't played the game or have only seen it through once, you might not be aware of this route. The Serenoa route is Triangle Strategy's "golden route," where the protagonist Serenoa finds an option to resolve all the great mysteries and conflicts that surround the ongoing war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nhTJ-Evv_U
To get that, you'll need to make certain choices throughout the game, and be ready to see them through. Doing so will unlock this new extra chapter, which serves as a golden epilogue of sorts.
Return to the battlefield
Alongside content updates, Square Enix also says that some battle adjustments have been made for repeat playthroughs. Other options have been added, that all seem to make repeat playthroughs a bit smoother to run through. It's nice, considering many players who are going for the golden route are likely doing so on a second run.
I'm happy to see Triangle Strategy get this update, though. It's remained a memorable, solid tactics experience both on the Switch and other platforms. Any sort of follow-up or sequel speculation aside, I'm happy to see the Triangle Strategy team is being given the room to make these post-launch updates so far out, as little treats for fans who dug this far into the game.

Yesterday, BioWare announced it was opening pre-orders on a limited edition sculpture of Captain Shepard in commemoration of the Mass Effect series.

After six years of massive open-world RPGs, Ubisoft’s long-running Assassin’s Creed franchise is returning to its stealth-based, dense city roots with Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the more I see of it, the more excited I get for October. I’ve enjoyed the series’ foray into RPGs over the years, but 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which took me more than 100 hours to roll credits on, left me exhausted and burnt out with what Ubisoft had done to a franchise whose games previously took 20 hours to beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of the best Star Wars tales came from these games
The video team at Destructoid has been busy cooking up some new stuff for the community, and I'm pleased to present the "History of" series, and it's starting out with a bang! Brett Medlock and company are looking at Star Wars action games: which have a long and storied history dating back to early consoles and the PC platform.
Having experienced Star Wars games basically since they started taking hold on the NES, I've seen an unprecedented amount of massive hits mixed with poor decision-making across the board. Star Wars is so massive that Lucas and Disney respectively could not and cannot currently contain it, and licensing projects out to other studios is just a cold reality. But as we moved out of the relatively safe zone of '90s console platformers and PC flight sims, things got a little dicier. If you're curious, yes, the flood of prequel games is covered in the video (that all starts roughly 3:00 in!).
Thankfully, there are tons of bright spots like Dark Forces (which evolved into Jedi Knight, augmenting itself to the very spine of the IP itself) and KOTOR to help carry on the "Star Wars video game" name as it were. A lot of that light and legacy also shone through for some of the modern hits, like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. There is still plenty of room for fun and innovative Star Wars titles, so long as creatives are willing to take risks.
But don't just take it from me, watch the video below!

NetherRealm Studios is rebooting the Mortal Kombat universe again with Mortal Kombat 1. The slightly confusingly named MK takes everything back to its origins, and then twists it. The characters and combat that have become enshrined in pop culture history are still here, but with adjustments both big and small.
This feeling of old nostalgia blending into new ideas kept coming to my mind while playing Mortal Kombat 1. I got a chance to play some matches of MK1 as part of Summer Game Fest 2023, climbing the classic towers with each of the characters available. And while MK is looking ahead to a new future, there's still a piece of it that loves to honor the past.

Street Fighter 6 might have only just gotten out of the gate, but already the mod community is hard at work on bringing an array of fun 'n' silly new skins to the 18 World Warriors of Capcom's smash sequel. And we're absolutely getting off on the right foot, with these skins that turn poster boys Luke and Jamie in Darkstalkers' very own night slashers, Morrigan and Felicia.
As created by artist and modder Remy2FANG, the new skins bring the spirit of Darkstalkers to the Street Fighter 6 universe, just as we all wanted. Luke ditches his horrendous cuffed pants for the succubus' sultry ensemble, while Jamie shows off more than his usual amount of cheek as melee moggy Felicia.
They both look cute af, is what I'm saying.
https://twitter.com/Remy2FANG/status/1668445962791174144?s=20
The Street Fighter 6 skins are available over at the Nexus Mods hub, and represent just a sliver of the alt costumes that the talented mod community will no doubt be sending into battle over the coming years. Of course, it goes without saying that modding titles is a strictly unofficial deal, and players will want to make sure that they know exactly what they're doing before they go poking around in the game's source folders.
Every Street Fighter title since SFIV has found itself awash in awesome creations, often referencing characters and worlds from the gaming universe. It will be rad to see what these talented creators come up with next. Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Atari has announced that they are publishing a version of their upcoming retro-pop indie game, Mr. Run and Jump, on an actual Atari 2600 cartridge. Pre-orders open July 31, and it’s expected to ship 3-4 months after that.
When I recently covered Mr. Run and Jump’s announcement, I mentioned that it originally started as a homebrew project before being expanded to a modern game. In that article, I opined that I’d rather play the original version. I’m getting my wish here, and I’m almost embarrassed about it. Obviously, Atari had this planned before I opened my big mouth, but I’m not used to having a demand actually met.
Mr. Run and Jump is largely how it sounds. It’s a speedy little platformer, and while that may sound routine, it wasn’t a genre that was widely covered on…]]></summary>

The Ace Attorney series is getting another collection, this time focusing on the second trilogy of attorney adventures. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy will bring more of the series to modern platforms in early 2024.
Announced at last night's Capcom Showcase, the trilogy collection will contain three Ace Attorney titles. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirt of Justice are all included in the compilation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4M9VfoAC68
The games will be in full HD, and include seven language options as well as voice recordings. Not much more has been shown about it, other than that it brings the three entries together into one bundle. I imagine it will be packaged the same as the original trilogy collection was.
And justice for all
This compilation is a very intriguing collection of games. While the original trilogy followed the first three games, showing lawyer Phoenix Wright's early career and journey, this second trilogy switches gears and looks towards Apollo Justice.
Apollo is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm really happy to see his trilogy get a collection. These games were part of the 3DS catalogue, so seeing them escape the shutdown is nice. As far as the actual games, I feel like reception on them is a bit more mixed compared to the original Ace Attorney trilogy. That said, I personally enjoy these entries quite a bit. Spirit of Justice actually contains one of my favorite cases in the entire Ace Attorney series!
Hopefully, having three collections at this point—the original, the Apollo games, and the Great Ace Attorney duology—means a new entry is a possibility. If Layton can stage a comeback, so can Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, and the gang.

As part of the IGN Summer of Gaming, Foreign Gnomes has announced the follow-up to their 2021 critically acclaimed rhythm RPG, Everhood 2.
In Everhood 2, you will play as a lost soul. You’re recruited by a Raven, who I guess has your voice. You travel between worlds, meet people, and fight others.
Everhood was unique for having a Guitar Hero-inspired battle system, which is actually better than that salad of a sentence makes it sound. Each of the characters you fought had their own unique music that made each battle feel distinct. It helped that the music was pretty solid. That will be returning and expanded.

This comes from Giant Bomb, who spoke with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty and Xbox boss Phil Spencer. The two spoke about a range of topics to do with Xbox as a whole, but Booty notably claimed that Starfield would be the Bethesda game with the least amount of bugs the developer has ever shipped.

Sumo Leamington — a new studio from Sumo Digital — revealed its next project during the PC Gaming Show 2023 this past weekend. Stampede: Racing Royale is "Fall Guys meets Mario Kart", a free-to-play 60-player battle royale kart racer that focuses on destructive items and elimination-based races.
The game is coming to PC Early Access in 2023, with "consoles" to follow at a later date. The Switch itself hasn't been confirmed, but we'd like to think — given the premise — that we'll be seeing some battle royale racing fun in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antitrust hearing scheduled for August
The United States Federal Trade Commission has requested that U.S. place an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing its proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard before the FTC's antitrust lawsuit, set to take place this August.
Despite the legal opposition from the commission, as well as the approval rejection from the UK, The FTC believes Microsoft fully intends to go ahead and complete the $68.7 billion merger, and that "they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time". The FTC filed suit against Microsoft back in December 2022, but the case is still yet to be heard in court.
The FTC has asked for an injunction preventing the sale from taking place be filed no later than June 15, and that said injunction remain in place until the court makes its decision later this summer.
In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Microsoft president Brad Smith writes: "We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court. We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market."
The FTC continues to build its case against the proposed sale ahead of August's hearing. The commission is expected to present arguments that Microsoft's ownership of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft studio will create something of a monopoly within the industry, limiting player choice and confining popular brands to MS own platforms. Microsoft has repeatedly denied that this is the intent behind its proposed purchase.
Pretrial briefs are expected to take place in July, with the court officially opening August 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[L'eau life.
Zut alors! Splish-splashing its way onto Switch in stunning watercolour is Dordogne, a nostalgic kayak trip down the metaphorical river of life – and also down the literal river of Dordogne in the south of France. Umanimation, the production company behind the game, specialises in “transmedia universes”, its previous works including a web series and a VR short film. This, its first video game project, combines the airy sweeps of gorgeous watercolours with all the button-pressing fun of gaming - and does so to deliver a deeply touching rumination on loss.
The story focuses on Mimi and her paternal grandmother Nora. When Mimi is in her early 30s, Nora passes away leaving behind a letter telling Mimi to visit her old house in the French region of Dordogne. Mimi’s father Fabrice has been feuding with Nora for as long as Mimi can remember. She doesn’t know why, but it dates back to a childhood summer visit to her grandmother’s house. She has hazy, happy memories of the holiday, but also suffers from a mental block. Thus is established an emotive mystery wrapped up in halcyon, sun-drenched memories.

Thanks to an announcement from the official Nintendo of America Twitter account, we now know that the publisher is running a "Hyper Max Sale" through June 25 at 11:59PM PT. The sale contends it has savings of "up to 50%," with the low end of the sale hitting roughly 20% off of some big-name games and DLC. Triangle Strategy, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, Metroid Dread, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 are all among some of the more marquee games to join the sale.
For the industry, this isn't as big as many other publishers have gone in the past. But for Nintendo, even $10 off some first party games is "big!"

Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? 
Anyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.

Those of you who have been waiting for the new ASUS ROG Ally handheld, the day has finally arrived. Although it was only announced back in April, with many even thinking it was a prank, it's nice to see some Steam Deck competition on the market.
With the Ally now out, we can truly see what PC handhelds can offer those looking for gaming on the go. While Valve's Deck device has been the front-runner so far, time will tell whether ASUS can make as big an impact.
Where the ROG Ally differs from the Steam Deck is in its potential to be a better machine. For example, while the latter has a Ryzen Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 graphics, the former has the newer Zen 4 processor as well as RDNA 3. The Ally is also said to be lighter.

Taking place on 1st - 4th September 2023 within the Seattle Convention Centre, the event will bring fans together with a number of activities and entertainment, including Switch gameplay, meet and greets, live performances, and memorable photo opportunities.
Of course, actually attending isn't guaranteed, mind. You need to register for the chance to be selected, and even then, it's only open to US residents with a US Nintendo Account. For more information on how and when to register, be sure to check out our full guide on Nintendo Live 2023:

They say this will leave them a "stronger, more efficient company". Their purchases include Gearbox, Crystal Dynamics, Volition, the rights to The Lord Of The Rings, and so many more. Embracer own 138 studios and have over 16,500 people working for them, and it's not clear how many will remain afterwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But don't mark your calendars just yet
No doubt, plenty of you horror fans have been anticipating Bloober Team's upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2. Some of you will be excited, while some of you may be holding back judgment. In any case, it's on a lot of people's lips, and the game may have its release date already.
As spotted by Twitter user ResiEvilCentral, Australian website Gaming Gorilla has made Silent Hill 2 available for pre-order, at a cost of $89 AUS (about $60 US). However, the most interesting part about this listing is that it says the "expected release date" for the remake down as September 29, 2023.
Now, given that neither Konami nor the developer has said when it's likely to launch, where Gaming Gorilla got this information is definitely interesting. Last we heard, Bloober Team denied SH2 was ready for release. The fact that both Steam and the PlayStation Store also do not list a release date means this could well have been in error.
https://twitter.com/resievilcentral/status/1668311447212785692
Either that or someone somewhere has access to information the rest of aren't privy to. As of this moment, there is no official release date for the game, so it's entirely likely that this is just a rumor or someone has made a mistake. At the time of writing, the "leaked" release date is still on the retailer's website. However, it's best not to get your hopes up until the studio/publisher either confirm or deny these latest developments.
Silent Hill enjoys a pretty solid legacy, though it's been lying dormant for too long. The second installment, released in 2001, has gone down as one of the most important survival horror games of all time. Given this, it's not surprising that so many are looking forward to the remake. Whether Bloober Team can pull it off remains to be seen at this stage.

Embracer Group has announced that it is entering a 'restructuring program' with a view to becoming a "leaner, stronger and a more focused, self-sufficient company". In other words, it's about to undertake some pretty substantial cost-cutting measures after spending the last six years or so focusing on widespread studio acquisitions.
In an open letter penned on the official Embracer Group website, CEO Lars Wingefors states that the company's actions will include, but not be limited to, the closure or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects. It will also decrease spending on 'non-development costs' such as overhead and other operating expenses.

Capcom has launched a beautiful 40th-anniversary website which celebrates the company's history, as well as shares artwork and design docs, and acts as a hub for some of the developer's biggest titles.
Capcom Town is bursting with colour, characters, and chiptune music, which will get anyone who's ever played, seen, or heard of any of Capcom's titles just a little bit giddy. The town is segmented into areas for certain franchises — Street Fighter has a dojo in the top right corner, for instance, while Monster Hunter occupies the space in front of the giant arcade machine.

The patch notes on Nintendo's website (via Gematsu) reveal that a brand new epilogue-like chapter, called 'Extra Story', has been added. This is reportedly a final epilogue cutscene that takes place after Serenoa's route, so you need to have completed that at the very least in order to see it.

The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is looking rather promising, but many Switch owners have been wondering how it will run on Nintendo's hybrid platform.

Blizzard's Overwatch 2 dev team ignited the community last month when it announced that the Hero Missions, part of the PvE content that was announced alongside the game in 2019, were canceled. However, not all of the PvE content was axed. I traveled to Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine, California to be the first person outside of the company to get my hands on the upcoming Story Missions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

[Update: Capcom Town is now open! Go and check it out right here!]
During yesterday's Capcom Spotlight live stream, the publisher announced that it was "building" a digital theme park, Capcom Town, for its upcoming 40th-anniversary celebrations. The digital funland will open in June and is a celebration of the veteran studio's legacy of games and franchises.
Very little has been offered in the way of details, but Capcom Town will feature "a digital museum and other buildings" which one would assume will be filled with artwork, marketing materials, write-ups, and trailers from franchises such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and many more. We will likely see areas based on Capcom's arcade roots, hopefully offering nods to titles such as Strider, Side Arms, Gun.Smoke, and maybe even Cadillacs & Dinosaurs... Ok, now I'm just being unrealistic.
Capcom is genuinely one of the industry greats, and while the past decade has certainly seen the studio stumble on more than one occasion, the developer seems to have been back on track since the 2018 launch of Monster Hunter World, which has led to a string of quality, successful releases. And with Resident Evil 4 and Street Fighter 6 on deck for this year, it looks like Capcom will have plenty to celebrate come its June anniversary.
Capcom Town will have a grand opening on June 13, 2023. A teaser site is now live.

As part of the Capcom Showcase, the developer sorely announced that its sci-fi epic Pragmata has once again been delayed. This time, a new release window was not announced, giving the impression that the long-in-development title might still be well over a year away at the very earliest.
Cool trailer though. Can't stay mad at the kid.
Pragmata is in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pragmata may be the most mysterious title in Capcom's upcoming portfolio of games, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future. A brief update during the Capcom Showcase confirmed the game's release was slipping out of 2023 and into the unknown.


The video shows the enigmatic, glowy-eyed little girl (apparently named Diana) innocently drawing as her decidedly adult astronaut(?) guardian fends off mechanized attackers before he whisks her away from danger. We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...
It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.
Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.
Thank you for your continued support.
-The Pragmata Development Team
Pragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a "near-future dystopian world on the moon," according to Capcom. The game was originally slated for 2022 before getting delayed to 2023. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The Summer Game Fest presentations are all but complete, but there are still several publishers preparing to do their own thang with their own live streams — And in just an hour from now, Capcom will open up the airways with its own Capcom Showcase presentation, filled with news and updates.
We already know that the veteran developer is preparing to show off several upcoming releases, including action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2, dinosaur battler Exoprimal, and the remastered spook-fest Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. In addition, we can perhaps expect post-launch news for the recently released Street Fighter 6, and perhaps an update on the "Separate Ways" DLC for smash hit Resident Evil 4. There's a lot of possibility, so it should be a fun little stream.
The Capcom Showcase live stream kicks off at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The stream won't even take up too much of your time, as it is expected to run a short 30 minutes. Check out the show for yourself in the embed below, and we'll be sure to bring you all of the news right here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that last-gen graphics cards are getting huge discounts at the moment, as pent-up demand has been sated and next-generation models are starting to be released from both Nvidia and AMD's lineups. We've covered more mid-range models before, but today we have something a bit different: a truly mainstream graphics card that delivers excellent 1080p performance at less than £200, plus nice extras like ray-tracing hardware, FSR 2 image upscaling and a modern media encoder for streaming and recording gameplay. 
I'm talking about the AMD Radeon RX 6600, which is available in the popular Sapphire Pulse configuration for £180 plus £8 shipping over at Overclockers UK - with a free copy of the Resident Evil 4 remake. This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago. Nice!

Making the jump from a two-screen device to a single-screen experience can be a tricky proposition. Some games, like The World Ends with You, lose something in the conversion. Others, like Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire’s Conspiracy Deluxe Edition, discover life can effortlessly go on with just one screen. Most games have a logical path forward moving from the Nintendo DS/3DS to modern hardware.
But Etrian Odyssey is not like most games. This franchise is categorically connected to the dual-screen era of gaming that it’s almost hard to imagine how it could possibly work on Switch. I mean, what’s Atlus going to do, cram everything onto one screen and hope for the best?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who Goes There?
During yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, publisher Secret Mode released a creepy teaser trailer for a new horror title, Still Wakes the Deep, which is currently in development for PC and Gen9 consoles.
Developed by The Chinese Room in Unreal 5, Still Wakes the Deep sees an offshore oil rig in the North Sea under siege by a mysterious and terrifying entity. It's 1975, a storm is raging, and something has come aboard the Beira D rig. With lines of communication severed and escape seemingly impossible, there may be no other option than to face terror itself if you are to survive this horrific incident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI74BV20B7g
The teaser trailer offers little in the way of gameplay and concept, but we do get to see some very impressive visuals, as well as catch a glimpse of the foreboding, isolating atmosphere of the title. It all feels very The Thing, which is obviously a more than suitable comparison for '70s isolation horror. The Chinese Room is no stranger to horror, having developed titles such as Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Dear Esther, and with the power of Unreal 5 in its hands, Still Wakes the Deep could eventually prove to be the studio's magnum opus.
Still Wakes the Deep is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Since the reveal of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2021, I’ve been curious how The Division developer Ubisoft Massive will take on this property, one of the most financially successful movie franchises in the world, and translate it into a video game. Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on. 
Most interesting to me, instead of controlling an Avatar, which is meant to resemble Pandora’s native Na’vi,…]]></summary>

When I covered Overwatch 2 at its "release," I was anxiously waiting for the major PVE element that would eventually come down the pipeline. It sounded absolutely fantastic and would have added a true PVE element to the game, something Overwatch sorely needed for longevity. Sadly, those plans were scrapped, and although the team is still excited about what they're putting out, it's not the same.
But all that is still a little ways out. For those of you who are still playing, here's what to expect in Season 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlook is strong
It is a time of unrest. In the Star Wars universe, that’s all the time. But apparently, that’s important in Star Wars: Outlook – I mean Star Wars: Outlaws – which was shown off by Massive Entertainment as part of Ubisoft Forward 2023.
You play as Kay Vess, a thief who has a bounty on their head. She sneaks around and sucker-punches some dudes who don’t look like her. Her furry axolotl can be commanded by her to fetch weapons in the midst of combat. It’s actually pretty cute. Very merchandize-able.
https://youtu.be/c7K2TA0bBpY
She then takes off into the open world. Yeah, it’s open world. Normally, this isn’t much of a bulletpoint, but for Ubisoft, it’s a warning. So, this whole thing is just accomplishing a side-quest delivery, and then returning to the quest giver. She then takes off in her ship, which, again, is the most unimaginative-looking ship I’ve seen in a while. There’s some space combat. Quest complete.
I mean, it looks nice. It sounds nice. It’s very Star Wars-y, which I mean as a compliment. Still, though, the whole vertical slice of gameplay is so Ubisoft that it gives me pause. A lot of the features of Star Wars: Outlook, uh, Outlaws look pretty cool. I just don’t want to be using them to accomplish a bunch of shallow, repetitive nothing missions.
We’ll see for sure just how it turns out when Star Wars: Outlaws release sometime in 2024.

I am a man who understands only that there are lanky Smurfs who live in a world you'd get if you mashed Halo and Viva Piñata together. So, having seen roughly 30 minutes of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, I can give you the unfettered lowdown of a person who's analysed it with a cold, hard stare. In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.

As the penultimate act of the Ubisoft Forward stream, we saw a lot of footage of Assassin's Creed Mirage. The first revealed trailer, as has been the rhythm of this show, focuses on the story. Unsurprisingly, this splices together some cinematic scenes to give us an overview of the characters and show off some environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hjico7nYvo
Of course, the real meat and potatoes lies in the subsequent gameplay trailer. This provides us almost eight minutes of footage showing what Assassin's Creed Mirage will bring to the table.
That said, we didn't receive any confirmation over whether this was an an open world or a semi-open world. I think they should have included that vital detail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxpYHW-M_Ac
As we reported previously, Assassin's Creed Mirage will launch on October 12 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. Pre-orders are available now.

If only there was a way to get my brain to remember which obstacles were where... Happily, Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown has an ingenious solution.

There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a "true" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake.

The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.
The demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Ubisoft's Foward event, we got a new look at gameplay from Assassin's Creed Mirage – a throwback of sorts to the long-running series' roots. 
In the footage, we see a few assassinations, a chase, and our protagonist Basim taking on missions. There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.
Check out the gameplay footage below.


Notably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.
You can also check out a new trailer for the game below.

We next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.]]></summary>

The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.

Following a bass-heavy, rubber-burnin' new trailer, we were treated to a sizzle reel spotlighting the title's high-velocity visual effects and globe-trotting environments. We got to see various high-performance vehicles tearing through the main streets of USA, under the neon glow of Japan, and, for the very first time, the tropical paradise of Oahu.
We then saw a snazzy orange Lambo which, apparently, "You are excited about as I am".
You're not the Ubiboss of me.

More importantly, it was announced that Motorfest players can import their current garages of prized vehicles into the new game absolutely free of charge. So you don't have to leave that beloved jalopy behind. The Crew Motorfest launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms September 14. An open beta will take place between July 21-23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
XDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora kicked off Ubisoft Forward with a new trailer providing our best look at the game yet.
Frontiers of Pandora follows the narrative blueprint of the films in that you control a Na’vi to protect your world from militaristic human invaders. The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.


The game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. 
We also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

And sometimes, all you need from a sequel is the first one, but a bit bigger and bit better.

It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care. From what I've played, it's more about being the looter shooter for those who care about fine-tuning the consistency of the numbers they're able to extract from their foes.

The second segment is a  2-hour long action-focused mission centering on Clive’s infiltration of a fort. While the progress from this section will not transfer to the final game, it does provide a hefty sample of the game’s stylish-action-inspired combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me tell you, being at an Xbox Games Showcase in-person is quite the experience. I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.
The countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, "five, four, three!", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of "Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.

During Summer Game Fest 2023, I had a chance to get a behind-closed-doors look at Alan Wake, the highly anticipated sequel 13 years in the making.
The road to Alan Wake 2 was full of speed bumps involving publishing rights and finding the right ideas, hence the 13-year gap. "We've been trying and now finally everything just clicked into place," co-director Sam Lake says. "We got the publishing rights of the original game back, so we were in a position to create a remastered version for the PlayStation audience as well as a wider audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. 
As you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th.

Oh, Diablo 4? It’s alright, yeah. Quite fun. But it’s recently taken a backseat to something far more illustrious. His name, the subtitles inform me, is Denysov, and he lives in Diablo IV's world of Sanctuary. He is a lone man, with a lone hammer, who, despite nightmare and terror unfolding all around him, come hell or harsh splinters, just works on his lovely door all darn day.

What if EVE Online took place in medieval europe, except all the fairies the peasants believed in were real?

It's coming from some veteran EVE devs, who place an emphasis on community, inclusivity and player agency. I suspect I will never play it, but will very much enjoy reading about those who do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors just can't seem to die, but it's unclear whether that's due to its attentive development team or the immortal nature of vampires. Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.


The update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.
Vampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.]]></summary>

I adored the first one - and even picked it for May's RPS Game Club - but the prospect of a sequel seemed almost too good to be true. Happily, tonight's PC Gaming Show brought the news I was waiting for. After a dramatic animated trailer reveal, I'm happy to report that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is indeed a real thing, and I spoke to Damian Martin earlier this week to find out all about it.

Described as the "simplest character creator" the team have ever made, Starfield will let you dig into the finer details of your space captain's face, right down to their teeth for reasons I can't quite work out yet. An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk. What's interesting is that this time around, the team have used the in-game tool to create every last one of Starfield's NPCs.

They make a game which looks quite a lot like 'Warcraft 3 meets StarCraft 2'. That's Stormgate, and you can see that for yourself in the first gameplay trailer, below.

Announced during the Xbox Game Showcase at this year's not-E3, Towerborne looks much more family-friendly. Which is lucky because you'll be wanting to grab family members, as it's also a co-op adventure. Check out the trailer below.

Their whole deal is that they're trying to grapple with humanity's biggest questions and are on big ol' space quest to find answers. They're concerned with weird artifacts, ancient alien intelligence, and a bunch of other space anthropological happenings.

Starfield features over 1000 planets to visit, each procedurally generated upon your approach but populated with handcrafted elements. Your "freedom" upon landing on these planets - many of which seem near-barren - is whether you spend your time doing some quests, 'surveying' the local flora and fauna, or shooting rocks with your space laser.

Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.


The sequel takes place in the same world as the last, "some time" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.
If this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it "a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.]]></summary>

At the combined Xbox Games Showcase slash Starfield Direct tonight, Bethesda did a deep dive on a few aspects of their upcoming space RPG Starfield - including the companion system. Although, given that you assign them to different tasks on your ship and various outposts, it might be more appropriate to call them "employees". Although again, you can romance some of them, which is definitely an HR issue.

Whereas before your guns had about as much impact as the buzz of your phone in silent mode, they now feel like they've got some real weight behind each trigger pull. The new area of Dogtown is pretty sweet, too.

Despite an extremely rocky launch, I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 a lot. I beat it around its release in 2020, and I’ve checked in a few times to see how the CD Projekt Red’s post-launch work has improved the game, but those check-ins were always a few hours. I’d drive around, shoot some enemies, and listen to Run The Jewels on the in-game radio. Satisfied with my V’s ending, I didn’t have a reason to return to the meat of the ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's probably quite difficult, after you've mapped more or less the entire planet, to work out what to add to a Microsoft Flight Simulator sequel. The answer turns out to be: jobs. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 was revealed at tonight's Xbox Showcase and it'll include the ability to not only fly all sorts of aerial vehicles, but to fly them with purpose - whether an air ambulance, aerial firefighting, crop dusting, hot air ballooning, or about a dozen other roles.

        <updated>2023-06-11T18:53:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clockwork Revolution made its debut at today’s Xbox Games Showcase via a trailer that set the stage for its steampunk-flavored RPG action.
The first-person adventure puts you in control of a woman hailing from the steam-powered Victorian-era city of Avalon who discovers a time machine, along with the revelation that the city – and its brutal oppression of the lower class – is the result of intricate time manipulation by the villainous Lady Ironwood. To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. 


The game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. 
Clockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

Now there's a new in-game trailer and at least a vague sense of what the citybuilding sequel will do differently than its venerable, many DLC'd predecessor. Mainly: bigger cities, more simulated cities, prettier cities. 

It also brought news of a release date: October 24th.

This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.
As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming.

To make matters worse, he’s completely naked, a fact the shocked beachgoers waste no time bringing to his attention. Your guess is as good as ours as to what trouble the lovable ex-gang enforcer has gotten into this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a first meaningful look at Avowed, the upcoming fantasy RPG on the way from the team at Obsidian. The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.
The new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.
Avowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, Payday 3 has a release date. Today during the Xbox Games Showcase, it was announced that the multiplayer bank-robber simulator will be coming out on September 21. 
Aside from a date, a flashy new trailer showed plenty of the robbery and action mechanics off. As you might've guessed, it sure does look like another Payday. Check it out below:


Payday 3 was announced all the way back in 2016 and has been stuck in development hell ever since. Apparently, it's set in a "living, enormous representation" of New York City."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an accidental early posting earlier this week on Atlus' official Instagram accounts, the remake of Persona 3 is officially real.


The Persona 3 remake is called Persona 3 Reload and is being made in Unreal Engine. The footage of the game points to it being a total, from-the-ground-up remake, which might explain why the recent re-release of Persona 3 on modern platforms was somewhat underwhelming. The game is set to release in early 2024 and will be available on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compulsion Games, makers of We Happy Few and Contrast, has announced a fascinating new project called South of Midnight.
The stylish trailer begins with a strange (and giant) musician strumming his guitar surrounded by forest critters in a bayou-like swamp. A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a "fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South."


South of Midnight has no release window, but it’s coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S and will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Xbox Showcase, we finally got a look at the open-world Star Wars game Ubisoft has been working on for the last few years. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.


The description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.
"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi," the description says. "Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted."
While the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow. For the full lineup of showcases this month, check out our streaming schedule.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Fable from Playground Games was previously announced, but the latest trailer gives us a better sense of the game's comedic tone. The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.


From there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.
No release date was revealed, but the game will be available on Game Pass day one.]]></summary>

Yet, the entirety of my time with Mortal Kombat 1 had me desperate for an equivalent to Street Fighter 6's modern control scheme: a simplified remap of the buttons which enables anyone to hop in and do cool moves.

And without a doubt, Remedy are making a big push for this to be a detective game alongside a survival horror one. My first impressions? Yeah, strong.

Since Cocoon’s reveal last year, I’ve been excited to one day check it out. Coming from Jeppe Carlsen, a former lead designer behind Playdead’s Limbo and Inside, its reveal trailer in 2022 made splashes amongst fans of the games Carlsen worked on. During Summer Games Fest this year, I finally got to play roughly 30 minutes of this strange, sci-fi puzzle game, and I don’t think it could have made a better first hands-on impression. 
Immediately, Cocoon’s visual style is striking. Its minimalist sci-fi aesthetic feels right at home within the lineage of Playdead games, although it’s import…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy classic 3D platformers and games that let you creatively tinker with their worlds, you may want to put Ruffy and the Riverside on your radar. This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.
As Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. 


In addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Future Games Show closed out with a new trailer for The Spirit of the Samurai, an eye-catching stop-motion 2D Metroidvania-style action game coming next year.


The game’s striking stop-motion presentation immediately stands out, paying homage to the classic model animation of Ray Harryhausen films, such as Mighty Joe Young, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. 
The Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.]]></summary>

Cats, cooking, seaside towns, pretty landscapes, magical girls - Wholesome Direct has it all. This year we from the RPS Indiescovery Podcast watched the show and have plucked out a handful of games that we're looking forward to the most, which was pretty difficult. There were a lot of great games this year.
There were around 70 games spotlighted during the showcase, so there was no way we could possibly list them all, but we've done our best and here are our bestest best picks. If you're after more gaming news and announcements from this year's not-E3 check out our coverage of not-E3 2023, Summer Game Fest round-up, and Day Of The Devs round-up.

Mortal Kombat 1 represents a clean slate for the long-running fighting game franchise just as the story does for its characters. After the cataclysmic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story expansion, Liu Kang has assumed the role of the all-powerful fire god. While he created the world with visions of peace, the Mortal Kombat characters do what they do best in relatively short order, and the blood starts splattering once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

Last year’s Sonic Frontiers brought Sega’s mascot some much-needed success in the 3D gaming realm, but outside of some segments in the 3D adventures and the externally developed Sonic Mania, the 2D side of the Sonic franchise has been grossly underserviced in recent years. Announced yesterday, Sonic Superstars hopes to give that corner of the Sonic gaming universe a shot in the arm, delivering gorgeous HD visuals, four-player cooperative play, and a bevy of unique Emerald Powers.
However, the announcement was met with a dose of skepticism, as, for many, it immediately conjured memories…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.
Shadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.


The humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. 
Are you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals feels like returning to a familiar place in a great way. I’ve known about the sequel for a couple of years – since Night School Studio announced it in 2021 – but it wasn’t until I went hands-on with it during Summer Games Fest that it dawned on me just how long it’s been since Oxenfree first came out. 
In that seven-year gap, I immediately notice that Oxenfree II is even more beautiful than its predecessor, an already pretty game thanks to its unique visual style. That aesthetic returns, but it pops even more on screen. N…]]></summary>

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

A statement from the game's official Twitter account explains that the asymmetric multiplayer slasher title will be removed from retail and digital storefronts once the license expires on December 31st. However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024. Until then, the base price of the game will be dropped to $4.99, and each piece of DLC will cost $0.99.

Friday the 13th: The Game pits a team of players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors working together to survive against a player-controlled Jason Voorhees. The game didn’t arrive to the warmest reception when it launched in 2017, but it’s always a bummer to see games disappear, especially when it's at the mercy of IP licensing. Even before this final blow, the game had a rocky existence due to legal disputes with the film's original creators halting the distribution of DLC and, later, the eventual shutdown of its dedicated servers.

To my great surprise, it wasn't the Rogue, which is currently sitting at the top of our tier list. Rather, it's the Sorcerer, which currently sits at the bottom of our class rankings. Presumably, everyone loves watching ice shards and lightning bolts leave their fingertips. So, is the majority of Diablo 4's player-base wrong, or are we?

But Kvark looks to Half-Life instead of the Doomquake clone era, and is all the better for it. You're a worker/prisoner in a sinister nuclear facility deep under 1980s Czechoslovakia where things, as you might guess, have gone terribly wrong.
The satirical Soviet posters and propaganda reels are here, but used sparingly, and more convincingly than the usual "Russia, haha! Vodka! lol!" fare, and although all its parts are fairly familiar, Kvark feels distinct enough that I had a hard time actually putting it down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like lots of people in the RPS Treehouse right now, I've been squeezing in bits of Diablo 4 around the various Summer Game Fest streams happening this week. I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. 
The next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's impossible to determine just how long ago 2014 was. Wisdom would dictate it sits around the 9 year mark, but no one truly believes that. Endless Legend? That was no more than two years ago, and I'll throw hands if anyone suggests otherwise. But apparently enough time has passed that just about every 4X game that came out that year has now been superceded by a newer title in the series. Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?
I don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.

The asymmetric multiplayer game, based on the film series of the same name, has had a rough time over the years. In 2018, it was caught up in the dispute between the original film's producer and writer, causing publisher Gun Media to halt all DLC plans.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
