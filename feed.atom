        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon mods are rolling in
Despite some glaring technical issues, the newest mainline games in the Pokémon series, Scarlet & Violet, have been smash hits. It's likely that Game Freak will do their best to patch the most glaring of glitches out as soon as they can, but that doesn't guarantee that the game's abysmal performance slow-downs will necessarily be fixed. Thankfully, fans are stepping in with mods to make for a smoother Pokémon experience, even though Nintendo is particularly tough on those who modify their games. There are some brave soldiers out there doing Arceus' work to help give us a better gaming experience even at the risk of being struck down by the powers that be, and we have to commend them for that.
The modder in question is called "theboy181," and they're creating a mod that allows players to take on the games at a silky smooth 60fps, which is a welcome change for those who have already given Scarlet & Violet a whirl. While the mod is not yet publicly available, and we don't have any information on when to expect the mod's release, theboy181 has posted some proof-of-concept photos to Twitter, and it looks absolutely amazing.
https://twitter.com/theboy181/status/1596759874654048263
If you want to give the mod a spin when it eventually comes out, you'll likely have to play it on a PC emulator rather than a Nintendo Switch, as that's how it's being developed in the first place. It's not impossible that theboy181, or another modder, could make it playable on a jailbroken console, and if you're already looking to mod a Nintendo title, I'd bet you're cool with hacking a Switch anyway.
I find it pretty amazing that players have figured out how to modify games so seamlessly, and while I would have preferred Nintendo release a polished, bug-free title in the first place, knowing that the modding community has our backs makes me feel a bit better about things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another look at the new Mario movie
We're getting another look at The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and soon. Nintendo is hosting a world premiere for The Super Mario Bros. Movie second trailer tomorrow, November 29.
The Direct, as Nintendo is dubbing it, will air live at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. There's no estimation on how long this one will be, though given its prior Direct, this movie teaser will likely be on the shorter side.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1597350002028064768/
As Nintendo states in its tweet, no game information will be included in this Nintendo Direct. Much like the first Super Mario Bros. Movie Direct, this one will seemingly focus on just the film. And also, hopefully, more selfie cam talking heads with the cast.
Mario goes to the movies
In our first trailer for the new Mario movie in September, we got a pretty good look and feel for what's in store. It seems like a Mario isekai, with the plumber waking up in the Mushroom Kingdom and setting off for adventure.
Meanwhile, Jack Black's Bowser absolutely stole the show. Both his pre-trailer guest spot and his in-trailer performance as the King of the Koopas was excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0
There are still some principal performances we're waiting on, though. No sign of Peach or Donkey Kong yet, and we got maybe a smidgeon of Charlie Day's Luigi at the end there.
Considering the teaser image for the new Direct features the stained-glass art of Peach's castle, we'll hopefully get more of the cast this time around.
The stream goes live at 2 p.m. PT over here on Nintendo's YouTube. Nintendo and Illumination's film is set to debut on April 7, 2023.

One of the better mini-games from the Yakuza series is making its return. Upcoming Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will have a cabaret mini-game.
The Like a Dragon, née Yakuza, series has had a wealth of minigames over the years. But few are as well-remembered as the cabaret ones. First making an appearance in Yakuza 0 and then again in Kiwami 2, these sections have you manage a club of hostesses.
Unlocking new hostesses through quests and scouting, while also competing with other clubs, became quite an engrossing side activity. And now it looks like the festivities return for Like a Dragon Gaiden.
https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1597301578675130368
Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name follows longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, after the events of Yakuza 6. The Dragon of Dojima stepped down from the spotlight in the sixth entry as Ichiban Kasuga took over in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. (Kiryu did make an appearance in that entry, but didn't star.)
Gaiden looks to bridge the gap a bit, as Like a Dragon 8 will have both Ichiban and Kiryu in the lead. And from the looks of it, Kiryu has been going through some stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxkn-dcy01k
A year of dragons
It looks like we've got a decent amount of RGG content on its way, as the studio is also due to release Like a Dragon: Ishin next February. With Gaiden also set for 2023 and Like a Dragon 8 aiming for 2024, there's a lot of Kiryu in store for the next year or so.
All that said, I'm happy to see the cabaret game returning. It's fondly remembered for a reason, and will hopefully add an extra bit of mini-game oomph to Gaiden. As much as I liked holding meetings in Like a Dragon, I'm ready to manage the club again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I gave you a sneak peek at 1/1, my cyberpunk novel about teens saving the future with NFTs, I could not possibly have predicted that Elon Musk would become a controversial figure. No one could. But the infobahn baron played a role in my tale's thrilling conclusion, and so my publishers are unthrilled by recent developments. They're holding the novel's launch back so I can address 'the Musk issue' with a sequel released simultaneously. So as a Cyber Monday treat, allow me to top up your thrill levels with excerpts from book two: Original Content, a Non-Fungible Future drop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yoshiro Kimura and his studio, Onion Games, are known for being off-beat. They make games that go in hard on their own strange internal worlds, wrapping up a particular sense of passion and energy in earnestly oddball humour. Undertale makes for a handy comparison - which makes sense, because many of the team worked on Moon, one of the games that inspired it. 
I'm telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year.

Publisher 2K Games and developer Firaxis have released a gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming release, Marvel's Midnight Suns. The comic-book strategy adventure will launch next week on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series, with PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch ports to follow at a later date.
In the video, we see the turn-based strategy that Firaxis has finally honed in games such as the acclaimed XCOM series applied to familiar characters from Marvel's huge universe of superheroes, (and villains). Under the guidance of custom protagonist "The Hunter", players will utilize the skills of names such as Dr. Stange, Wolverine, Iron Man, Blade, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and The Scarlet Witch to lead an attack on the dark armies of Lillith, Mother of Demons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Icc7o0ex4&t
Much like its XCOM brethren, Midnight Suns will offer up a story-based campaign, in which they will lead a growing team of heroes into the battlefield, utilizing the offensive and defensive capabilities of the crew to ensure a glowing victory in battle. New heroes and abilities will be forged and unlocked as the story progresses, with powerful, scene-clearing Hero Moves being offered to characters who are on a particular roll in the ongoing war against evil.
There's no denying that the XCOM titles handle strategic action very well, and this marriage of Firaxis' pedigree with the Marvel universe's cast of exciting characters could result in a fine hour-eater for those long, cold winter evenings. Having already faced a one-year delay, comic book fans need only wait one more week before they get the opportunity to take their favorite characters into battle.
Not my favorites, of course. As I don't see Jessica Drew or Nebula anywhere...
Marvel's Midnight Suns launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X December 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peeling the Layers
Onion Games' game director Yoshiro Kimura has revealed that the indie studio's next release will launch at some point in 2023. The tidbit was dropped in an interview rolled out this past weekend to subscribers of "The Secret Onion Cellar" newsletter.
Little has been revealed about the new release since its initial announcement back in 2020. We do know that the mysterious release is a sandbox RPG that will no doubt feature the stylized visuals and thought-provoking narratives synonymous with Onion Games hits such as 1997's Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and 2018's mournful shmup Black Bird. Also, according to Kimura, "children" will form the central theme of the new adventure.

In an additional letter to the fans, as printed by Gematsu. Kimura candidly speaks of the stress and turbulence of being an indie studio, detailing some of the psychological and physical pressures of working under budget and within limitations, while being completely unsure as to whether your release will ultimately hit it big on release. Kimura notes that it is also a very expensive process, that can take its toll on the expenses you have aside for basic living and other day-to-day costs.
"Indie game developers are basically bizarre creatures that are constantly running, laughing, and playing chess, all while bleeding profusely," concludes Kimura, in a typically colorful and visceral statement, before signing off delightfully as "Your Indie Game Making Uncle".
Black Bird is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and is well worth your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocky & Socky
If you're waiting on tenterhooks for Capcom's Street Fighter 6, then never fear, as the veteran developer has you covered with this baffling adaptation of the genre-defining Street Fighter II, now layered thickly with the chocolate-coated biscuit snack treats known the world over as "Pocky".
Yes, in a new promotional event, Capcom and Pocky distributor Ezaki Glico have created a variant of the 1991 arcade classic, freshly populated with those snack treats your anime-loving friend eats by the truckload. Specially decorated "Pocky K.O." boxes will be distributed throughout Japan from tomorrow, November 29, with images of the original World Warriors emblazoned on the packaging. Inside, a special code will afford access to Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition, which can be played on mobile platforms and web browsers.

What this boils down to is a typically regular edition of the grandfather of fighting games, imbued with extra Pocky advertising. For example, characters will hold Pocky sticks/boxes in their hands during victory poses. As a weird touch, players can achieve a special "Pocky K.O." when the health bar hits the correct chocolate-to-biscuit ratio on an average Pocky stick. Baffling. They could have at least applied Rainbow Edition physics.
Pocky? Partial Credit!
Of course, I'm not really angry about it. It's darn tragic, mind, but it's harmless fun. It's not even the first time that Pocky and Street Fighter have collaborated. Who remembers Street Fighter V's relatively pointless "Pocky K.O. Challenge" — a tournament that featured the same "sweet spot" qualifications for landing that elusive Pocky K.O.? Glico has also noted that it plans to build a Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition cabinet to take to trade events. A frightening prospect. The last thing yer boy Moyse needs is an excuse to eat even more chocolate whilst gaming.

The sequel to Freebird Games' superlative To The Moon, Finding Paradise is a game we weren't sure we really wanted or even needed when it first released back in 2017. How on earth could anything be expected to live up to the power and emotion of Kao Gan's wonderful 2011 adventure? Surely any attempt to return to this world and its characters would inevitably lead to disappointment.
Well, we were flat-out wrong, thankfully. While this follow-up doesn't quite hit the same highs, and certainly can't match its predecessor for tear-jerking moments, it turns out to be a very worthy return to this universe indeed, a game everyone should make a little time to check out, and an absolute treat for those of us who so loved everything about the very first outing for Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts.

There are a lot of unfortunate oversights which have been unearthed in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's first weeks out in the wild. Though many of these have had us chuckling away or otherwise afraid to turn the light off at night (spaghetti trainer haunts our dreams), none of them have the potential to be quite as annoying as this theory about the games' random number generator (RNG) when in Battle Stadium mode (thanks, Eurogamer).
Originally shared on Reddit by u/Lord-Trolldemort, the player found that using the move Frost Breath (an attack with 90% accuracy) wouldn't hit if it was the first accuracy check of the battle. This could be a coincidence, sure, but the Redditor tried out the hypothesis 14 times and had the same result on each attempt. Miss after miss. For the quick math, the chances of that happening with a working RNG is one in 100 trillion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaming monitors are great, but if we're being realistic, they can very easily become one of the priciest building blocks in your entire PC gaming setup. If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

We've read all about Street Fighter 6, we know the roster for Street Fighter 6, and some of us have even played Street Fighter 6, but where is Street Fighter 6? Hopefully, the answer to this question is nearing revelation, as the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea has now issued an official rating for the fighting sequel, suggesting that the title is getting ready to rock.
As spotted by VGC, The Korean game rating committee, fast becoming the best spoiler for game reveals and announcements going, issued a "Yellow" rating for Capcom's great-looking scrapper, which recommends it for players aged 15 or over. While this rating hardly suggests that we'll be stepping into Metro City by the holidays, we can at least expect a release date to be forthcoming — p…]]></summary>

Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.

The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.

For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You secure that shit, Hudson
Rumors continue to circle Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture in regards to work on one, (or several), as-yet-unannounced horror titles — The latest tidbit floating through the airwaves was that the No More Heroes developer might be working on a new AAA title set within the Alien franchise.
However, this admittedly bizarre meeting of studio and franchise is seemingly untrue, or at least that's the story from Goichi Suda himself. The esoteric game director responded to a tweet about the rumor with little more than a series of question marks — suggesting that if Grasshopper Manufacture were stepping into the iconic world of H.R. Giger's extraterrestrial beings, then it was news to him.
https://twitter.com/suda_51/status/1596118774901805056?s=20&t=CVRjWqcGKVLdtSteYdGYbA
Of course, the internet being the internet, this has not stopped die-hard fans from thinking that perhaps Suda is merely keeping the project under wraps, and that his tweet is a smoke screen to keep people guessing. Quite honestly, Grasshopper Manufacture seems a baffling choice of developer for 20th Century Fox to contact with an eye to adapting the famous film franchise, one would assume that it would choose a studio with a less stylistic and bespoke approach to game design.
Either way, you can't blame the fans for being excited. Despite being almost custom designed for gaming, the Alien franchise has had a seriously hit-and-miss relationship with the medium over the decades — with perhaps its best offering being 2014's Alien Isolation. It would be pretty fascinating to see what Suda and his crew could make of the franchise's frightening and violent xenomorphic universe, but it seems that this particular rumor can be laid to rest.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Kate's not impressed by what she's seen of Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life so far...

My very first Harvest Moon game was A Wonderful Life on the GameCube, which is lucky, because it's one of the best. I'm not just saying that because I'm basically a nerd donut filled with delicious nostalgia jam, but because it was a really weird game. It had characters that died. It had a full lifecycle in which you could live 30 years and then pass your farm onto your kid. There's a talking plant, and a yeti, and a mysterious homeless man who sometimes steals from your farm unless you train your dog to chase him away.

Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian.

I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?
Anyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.

The wired Pulsefire Haste (£20, normally £50) is the cheaper and lighter option, weighing in at 59 grams, while the wireless Pulsefire Haste Wireless (£40, normally £90) offers more freedom but requires recharging every 100 hours. It also weighs a tiny bit more, at 61 grams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stay close
After drudging through internet forum rumors and all sorts of wacky tips that didn't pan out: I finally found the answer to whether or not Pokemon Scarlet and Violet co-op can provide access to exclusives. Well, through experience, I'm here to tell you that it can!
Just know there is a caveat.

To be clear, you can catch exclusive Pokemon in co-op from either game that the co-op session has access to, but everything is proximity-based. Spawns will happen for either version (regardless of the host) so long as players are close to each other. Meaning, you can't just go off into another part of the game world and expect to farm all of the exclusives in minutes.
As you can see in the above image, I captured Gulpin (a Violet exclusive) in south province area three while in my wife's Violet game, as a Scarlet player (you can also view the proximity in which we were able to get this Gulpin to spawn in the header image). It's also important to note that if your partner is really early in the story, they may not have access to mount-based movement that can get them to some of the later/endgame zones: or may not even have access to some locations entirely. So you are at the mercy of either player's progression that regard.
With all that in mind, you can use this trick to your advantage to track down Pokemon as a unit in a really cool, organic way. The other player can potentially look up Pokemon locations on their Pokedex, then you can ride out together and look for them, and capture them together.
I spent part of the weekend doing just that, and it was a blast!

These Pokémon Scarlet and Violet glitches have really been something, right? At their best: hilarious, at their worst: game-breaking. But the one reaction that these bugs haven't tapped into is making us go 'awww'. That is, until now.
Indeed, it seems that some players have discovered a way to share the love with the Pokémon in their team. We are always quick to congratulate our 'mon after a battle with a berry, a stroke, a picnic, but what about when the trainer needs some comfort in return? Fortunately, it looks like you can get a hug from some of the wild creatures out there.

Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bewitching.
At this point, it’s easy to think that the Metroidvania genre has become played out. The indie community has positively run away with the genre over the past decade, producing projects that need to work increasingly harder to differentiate themselves from the pack. Still, this pressure has also bred some impressive innovation. Who would’ve thought the genre could be mashed well with a cute pinball game? Or what if your only movement option was teleporting? Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team (no, that’s not a new Street Fighter game) has decided to take a crack at this lineage of more offbeat takes on the genre with The Knight Witch, a new Metroidvania that integrates the white-knuckle gameplay of a bullet-hell game like Ikaruga. Though it’s not perfect in how it executes mixing these styles, The Knight Witch still manages to offer a memorable and enjoyable experience that ultimately proves itself to be worthwhile.
The narrative in The Knight Witch picks up several years before the events of the game, when society was ruled by the industrious Daigadai clan. Their focus on progress at all costs destroyed the environment and led to a civil war, with the opposition being led by the titular Knight Witches. After a lengthy campaign, the Knight Witches defeated the Daigadai, but the fallout from their epic battle forced society to move underground to rebuild. Years later, the story places you in the role of Rayne, the secret fifth Knight Witch who was never powerful enough to join her sisters and thus went unknown. Things are peaceful enough in Rayne’s underground village, but events quickly take a turn when it’s revealed that the Daigadai weren’t completely wiped out and they’ve come back for revenge. With the famed Knight Witches scattered and broken, it’s thus up to Rayne to defend her home and defeat the Daigadai once and for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they've also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 "fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island," as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's "still so many little and not so little things to do" before the big day hits on December 8th. "[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission," he says over email. "I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then."
But he also says he's "happy at the same time". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to "build a bridge between the worlds" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are "planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU," Gunn responded, "Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation)." In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, "Yes." 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta go back in time.
Before the Wii U Pro Controller and the Switch Pro Controller, the general consensus amongst Nintendo fans was that the GameCube controller was, in fact, the very best plastic shell to enable the wiggling of various thumbsticks. Granted, when compared to what came before it - the safe, yet dependable NES and SNES controllers and uh... whatever that N64 thing was - the GameCube controller didn't need to do a whole lot to come out on top, but it was nevertheless a comfortable, attractive piece of kit (if you ignore the rather terrible C-Stick).
If you, like us, long for the simpler days of the GameCube, then the good news is that you can practically turn your Switch into one with Retroflag's Handheld Controller. It's a transparent case that takes the iconic purple colour of the GameCube and whacks on a bunch of similar looking thumbsticks and buttons to pay homage to Nintendo's cute little console box. You've got a proper d-pad here, green and red 'A' and 'B' buttons respectively, slightly curved shoulder buttons, and even a dinky little C-Stick in place of the regular right analogue stick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the best Cyber Monday deals on desktop gaming PCs are, quite simply, the same offers that were up for grabs on Black Friday. I suppose you could grumble that they weren’t eighty-sixed in favour of newer, better, Monday-er deals, but if you’ve been weighing up a new prebuilt PC, think of today as another chance to find a deal you missed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raceway to Recovery
Sonic Team has released that first major patch for its recent release Sonic Frontiers — Rolling out on PlayStation now, Version 110 addresses numerous issues with the so-so adventure. Similar patches for other console and PC platforms are set to follow in the near future.
The patch notes are, oddly, only available via the Japanese Sonic Frontiers Twitter. But, thanks to a translation by UpdateCrazy, we know that Version 110 includes fixes for a variety of in-game problems, including UI and map optimization, fixes to audio issues, performance improvements, and fixes for numerous fatal crashes. The new update also cleans out a bug that would cause the Chronos Island boss to randomly disappear upon retry.

Sonic Frontiers launched on November 8 to a mish-mash of reviews and divisive fan praise. While some found the new adventure an interesting and unique new take on the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, others were ostracized by repetitive gameplay and a dull, somewhat miserable environment. Much of the fanbase sees Sonic Frontiers as a positive step for the dice-roll franchise, however, and hopes that it represents a new dawn for a series that has had its fair share of terrible releases.
There is still work to be done to bring Sonic Frontiers fully up to speed, (pun fully intended), and Sonic Team lead Morio Kishimoto has raised a few eyebrows with his comments that he sees the game's grand worldwide launch akin to a "global playtest". Despite this, Kishimoto points to the new title as a landmark moment, reinventing the long-running franchise for a brighter future.
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos.

Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — 'Emblems' — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

Whenever a significant anniversary for a video game franchise looms on the horizon, certain parts of the internet inevitably start speculating about the potential announcement of a brand new game.
It's not entirely unfounded, as some companies have used such milestones to break down their future plans, but we've been burned more times than we'd care to admit in the past with, shall we say, "lukewarm" anniversary celebrations from certain publishers (how did those Castlevania NFTs go for you, Konami?).

In a tweet from the company's official Japanese Twitter account (@Nintendo), the big N confirmed that it was opening the doors for job applications and encouraged anyone who wanted to get involved to apply.

Another batch of recognizable beans are headed to the wild and madcap world of Mediatonic's battle royale release, Fall Guys — Following on from recent crossovers such as Doctor Who and Hatsune Miku, this new event sees the arrival of three legendary World Warriors of Capcom's Street Fighter franchise.
Three skins have been (bean?) made available to purchase in the Fall Guys in-game store, representing the stoic martial arts expert Ryu, his shadowy and demonic rival Akuma, and the British special forces agent Cammy — who has certainly been getting around in recent years. Yes, she's wearing pants again. Chill. Additionally, new nameplates replicating the classic Street Fighter II aesthetic are also available, as well as some fun "Hadoken" and "Shoryuken" emotes. ACKSHUALLY CAMMY DUSNT DO A HADOOKEN ACKSHUALLY.
If you fancy taking these famous scrappers for a spin in the Blunderdome, then move fast, as they will be removed from sale on November 30. While we can promise that you'll see your chosen fave playing fast and loose alongside their fellow beans, I'm afraid that performing Akuma's Wrath of the Raging Demon is, unfortunately, out of the question. Sorry, tryhards.
Fall Guys is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Let's start this off with a big old disclaimer: We are not game developers. We are not good at programming. We don't really know why Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were broken and buggy on release. And also, we definitely don't just want to join the pile-on of hate aimed at Game Freak right now, even though they're probably doing fine with a record-breaking 10 million copies of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold in a matter of days.
But even though we can't provide concrete reasons for the game being broken, or solutions to the problems, we do have a few ideas and hopes for the future of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet — so we've made a list of 30 changes, fixes, and additions that we'd be happy to see in an update.

Sometimes, when a new Pokémon game nears, questions loom. Pokémon are mysterious creatures. Where do they come from? What are their natures? Why do professors send children out into the world on unpaid scientific internships and have them participate in illicit, unethical animal fights?
Well, instead of doing that last part, here at Destructoid we usually turn to Occams for answers about Pokémon instead, via the encyclopedic Occamsdex. It's better than getting arrested for unpaid child labor and/or creating a new Micheal Vick.
And thus, we asked the Destructoid community to submit Pokémon for his judgment once more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

This week is a very special one for the retro purveyors over at Hamster Corp, this week sees the publisher hit 300 consecutive weeks of console releases, having rolled out almost six years' worth of golden oldies to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range. And, befitting the importance of the occasion, the publisher is taking it right back to the 1970s, with a rerelease of Namco's first major smash hit, Galaxian.
Released to the burgeoning arcade market in 1979, Galaxian was Namco's effort to capitalize on the earth-shattering success of Taito's 1978 release, Space Invaders. Following a similar formula, Galaxian has the player control a space vessel at the foot of the screen, taking on patterns of enemies that form in concurrent lines across the top of the screen.

It can figure out who needs persuading to do what, then engage with those players using impressive and effective natural language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…]]></summary>

It's an arena fighting game geared towards couch co-op and couch competition, but there's online play and single-player modes too. Yesterday's "THE TRIALS OF JAZEPS" update added new difficulty levels to wave survival, as well as custom trials you can send to your friends. 

It also chucks in some new maps with portals, because the only thing better than a lightsaber-wielding spider is a lightsaber wielding spider suddenly emerging from a portal.

They're often poor imitations of much deeper and exciting board and card games you can play in the real world, offered as an unwanted break from the monsters I've come to stick a sword through. Will Genshin Impact's upcoming Genius Invokation TCG buck that trend? 
Probably not, no, but we'll know for sure when the Version 3.3 update lands on December 7th. There's also a new quest that takes place after the game's main storyline, a couple new playable characters, and a Breakout mini-game. Ah. I do actually quite like Breakout.

I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…]]></summary>

We recently had this chat in the RPS hive-mind, and going through each month and making note of my favourite releases completely shocked me with how many fantastic mystery games have come out this year. It’s honestly awesome. 
I’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it.

Perhaps the full package will pale in comparison to Valve's polish, but the bit in this trailer where the player scurries down a train while contorting around manhacks looks oh-so appetisingly transportative. I think it's time I dug out my lighthouses.

Like all the best couch co-op games, it's very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent's guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.
Oh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running. Fair enough, I suppose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival games! Oh, the many disparaging remarks I could make if only I had time in between punching rocks and eating an entire deer. It's not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it'd be unfair and untrue to say it's because there aren't enough good ones. It's more that I don't have much room for new ones.

Lilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I'd call a vibes-based game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Friday generally doesn’t involve as many CPU deals as it does, say, SSD deals or gaming keyboard deals – probably because there just aren’t that many CPUs. Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my journey into the depths of TikTok's dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that's now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It's been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called "dabloons" cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It's as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

        <updated>2022-11-25T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tiny bridge makes so much sense as a late-game Vampire Survivors challenge stage. The game's arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It's pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday's appropriately titled "The Tiny One" update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

Case in point: today’s rumblings that Grasshopper Manufacture, the devs behind the No More Heroes series, are working on a AAA game in the Aliens universe. This caught Grasshopper Manufacture's founder and CEO Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, so much by surprise that he wordlessly tweeted his utter bemusement at the rumour. I’m taking that as a no for the Alien game, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Black Friday means another opportunity for the Logitech G502 Hero - RPS readers' most favouritest gaming mouse - to get nice and cheap. This button-rich desk rodent is a particularly common sight during big PC hardware sales like Black Friday, but it's hard to tire of seeing when it's one of the best gaming mice ever made, and I actually prefer it to the recent G502 X refresh - especially when it's 56% off. That's precisely 56% off in both the UK and US, too.


Alright, technically it's the Logitech G502 Hero SE (Special Edition) that has the best available price in the UK; the standard model is £5 more for some reason. But the only difference between this and the all-black G502 Hero is the addition of some white highlights, so otherwise they share the same comfortable shape, highly customisable 11-button layout, and sharp 25,600dpi sensor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine not being fazed that a powerful demon cursed you, while maintaining your style and composure to investigate how to free yourself before your time’s up. I’m not sure I could manage not to totally lose it under those circumstances, but survival horror Sorry We’re Closed from devs à la mode and publishers Akupara Games plonks you into the vaguely 32-bit shoes of cool cucumber Michelle to do exactly that. The game takes the familiar fixed camera angles from classics such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone In The Dark, but combat’s being handled in first-person. Have a look for yourself below, and watch out for your third eye.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s still the frigid morning of Black Friday 2022, but there might already be a superlative gaming laptop deal up for grabs. Here in the UK, Ebuyer has an RTX 3070-equipped version of the MSI Katana GF66 laptop down to just £950 – a saving of £449.


Not only is that a big, meaty chunk of cash to carve off, it’s also an outstandingly low price for a gaming laptop with the RTX 3070 specifically. I’ve seen this high-end GPU in a few other laptops that are up for Black Friday sales, but they’re tending more towards the £1100 mark. In terms of getting the most graphical power for the least money, then, the Katana GF66 is unlikely be beaten today. Even by the RTX 3080 laptop for £1200 deal that's still going.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

However, that is slowly changing, with Black Friday Eve bringing a new low price on the high-end CPU: £475, down from a launch RRP of £600. That's a tidy £125 discount and a great price for one of the fastest consumer CPUs money can buy.

And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen.

If you celebrate it, happy Thanksgiving! If not, there's a few games to potentially pick up.
The marquee on for this small-ish week is The Knight Witch, which is due out on November 29 on the Switch eshop (also on Steam). It's a promising looking Metroidvania, with a few interesting concepts (like accessibility/mechanical toggles) and a spell system that also promises shmup gameplay.
That's pretty much it in terms of this week. Things will start picking up a little more as we head into the holiday season, and things quiet down in mid-December or so.

The two discuss the game's visual style, how it plays, its similarities to Vampire Survivors, and everything else going on in this exclusive preview. This demo build features a small snippet of one of the game's five volumes and our gameplay showcases how the on-screen action works, the horrors from beyond, and how quests work in Outer Terror. 
Check out Outer Terror for yourself below in this installment of New Gameplay Today: 


As you can see, Outer Terror is shaping up to be a great time, perfect for those moments where you've got 10 or 15 minutes to blitz through hordes of the undead, monsters from beyond, and more. For more about Outer Terror and what to expect from the game, check out our coverage of the game from last month. 
Outer Terror hits PC via Steam and the VoxPop Games Store (with exclusive content on that storefront, too), but a release date has not yet been revealed.

There’s loads more Morrowind in 2022 than I could’ve imagined as a teenager though, as the Tamriel Rebuilt mod project has been working for decades to add other areas of the Elder Scrolls’ provincial mainland into the game. Their latest release, 22.11, landed this week, adding a huge one-two punch of expansions. You can see some of one of those, Dominions Of Dust, in the trailer below.

SNK has offered up more information pertaining to the second season of its excellent team-scrapper The King of Fighters XV — From January 2023, new characters, modes, and under-the-hood tech tweaks will begin a steady rollout across all platforms, bringing further excitement to one of the long-running franchise's best-ever entries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCsTzOoWZZ0
Season 2 starts with the dawning of the new year, bringing with it a brand new character balance update and the first DLC fighter of season 2: Kyo Kusanagi fanboy and good-hearted goof Shingo Yabuki. As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.
In addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll have heard by now that Pentiment is bloody good. It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).
In the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.

Anywhoo, 'tis Thanksgiving, or Friendsgiving, or Turkey Day, or even Turkee Day (for my vegan pals).

Banks compares the base-building app’s simplicity to Oskar Stålberg’s procedurally generated hamlet-crafter Townscaper, although it seems a bit more complicated than that game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol will have 25 death animations locked behind its season pass, but developers Striking Distance Studios have insisted these aren’t being held back for DLC. Striking Distance CEO Glen A. Schofield took to Twitter to try to reassure players that work hadn’t even begun on the animations yet. You can watch The Callisto Protocol’s slightly early launch trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cult fighter to receive major upgrade
SNK's fab and precise fighting title Samurai Shodown is currently preparing to make a comeback, bolstered by the power of some slick new rollback netcode. The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title's new functionality.
The beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter's online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.
The arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho's devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here's hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.
Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

US newspaper Politico report that three anonymous sources with knowledge of the potential antitrust lawsuit have claimed it could happen in December, although any such lawsuit isn't guaranteed. The four FTC commissioners haven’t voted to decide on a complaint yet, and haven’t met with Microsoft or Activision Blizzard lawyers, two of the sources said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands.

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh look at what Dead Island 2 has been up to
Dead Island 2 is rising from the beyond to share more of what the team's been working on. A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.
The stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.
https://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1595462356230115329
What's the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of "action, gore, and zombies." Hopefully we get to see some details of what's in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.
Rising from the grave
It's at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it's been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.
“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”
More delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It's just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.
We'll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.

I've practised build orders, memorised specific civ counters, watched pro matches and agonised over key bindings. I have gone down into the nitty gritty of sheep micro, just to shear off microseconds from early villager gathering times, but I've never seen a good reason to build half of the landmarks in the game. It's a blessed relief, therefore, to see "landmark improvements" on the roadmap for Season 4, alongside a new mode and a funky purple-looking biome.

I’ll be upfront here; I like Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. They move the series forward in several important ways, and there are moments here that are the highest highs of the franchise’s history. Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are also ridiculously buggy. The performance issues are so rampant that they will impact your experience, regardless of your tolerance for low framerates. This is unacceptable for the largest multimedia franchise on the planet.
But you know what? I've had some hearty laughs encountering glitches in this game. There are so many weird, unpredictable oddities in Scarlet & Violet that I almost look forward to discovering them. In a perfect world, Game Freak would have intentionally made Pokemon do weird stuff in the background just for the player’s amusement. …]]></summary>

Ragnarok has come and gone for the God of War series. And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.
In a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he's asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.
"I don't know man, that game is big," said Williams. "I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn't count on it."
While there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn't too surprising. God of War (2018) didn't receive any extra DLC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJ4Km46A-0
Patience, boy
I haven't rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it's a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I'd be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.
Ragnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.
What could those projects be? Well, in the Kinda Funny spoilercast, Williams does mention he'd love to make a Castlevania game. It'd be a sight to see if that collaboration ever does work out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running with the pack
NetEase Games has made a "strategic investment" in the up-and-coming Polish studio Rebel Wolves. The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.
"We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. "Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development."
This "world-class AAA game" is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team's strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title's release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.
NetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.
Despite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdone.
The long-running legal case regarding controversial Cooking Mama: Cookstar has finally drawn to its conclusion, with The International Court of Arbitration ruling that publisher Planet Entertainment did indeed infringe upon Office Create's IP with the 2020 release.
Available for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Cooking Mama: Cookstar fell into controversy immediately, with rumors swirling that it utilized the Nintendo Switch hardware to mine cryptocurrency. Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn't the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company's right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.
"Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve," said Office Create at the time. "Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.
"Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create's approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create's approval."
Following this week's legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves. To date, the most recent official Cooking Mama release was Apple Arcade title Cooking Mama: Cuisine! which launched in July of this year.

In 2012, Nintendo released Kid Icarus: Uprising to the masses, and I was enamored. I couldn't put that game down for hours at a time, and amid some odd 3DS controls (that I did get used to!): it was one of my favorite games of that year, and that entire era. It was bubbling with more personality than the vast majority of games released even still, and it was like watching a cartoon in game form. 10 years later, Masahiro Sakurai is ready for it to make a return. 11 years ago, I was too!
In his latest game creation/development class video, Sakurai muses on difficulty: specifically, how Kid Icarus approached the concept with "the fiend's cauldron." In case you skipped over Uprising entirely (which is extremely likely!), the gist is that players can set …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End of line for Onoma
Square Enix Montreal, which recently changed its name to Onoma, has announced that it is to shut down service for four of its mobile titles. The quartet of games will officially end service on January 4, 2023, ahead of the studio's announced closure.
Hitman Sniper: The Shadows; Deus EX GO; Arena Battle Champions; and Space Invaders: Hidden Heroes will be removed from the iOS App Store and the Android Store on December 1. Additionally, all in-game purchases have been suspended. On January 4, all four titles will be rendered unplayable. No refunds will be issued for the initial game purchase or any DLC downloads.
https://twitter.com/StudioOnoma/status/1595185541875748864?s=20&t=ewt1z8CoqL038UFXRPuhGw
Square Enix Montreal, founded back in 2011, was mostly focused on the creation of mobile and free-to-play titles, finding a small but dedicated audience with its GO strategy series, which utilized famous IPs such as Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex. The studio was picked up earlier this year as part of a transaction that saw holding company Embracer Group acquire much of Square Enix' western subsidiaries, including studios Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, along with their respective IPs.
Soon after, it was announced that Square Enix Montreal was rebranding as Onoma, which appeared to signal a new lease of life for the company. However, in a shocking turn of events, the studio's closure was announced mere weeks later.

Your aim is to survive for as long as possible as hordes of slime and bats close in around you, and it's an excellent time. So excellent, in fact, that it's already seen a few spin-offs.
And having sampled a couple of Vampire Survivor-likes, it's made me appreciative of the game's visual clarity. Yes, things can get messy, but at least you're able to make out what's happening on screen. I don't think it's something the subgenre has quite grasped yet.

This time, it’s also being joined by its tenkeyless little brother, the G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless. This shares the same finely-crafted, all-mechanical build and solid wireless connectivity of the full-size model, merely cutting the number pad in pursuit of a smaller desk footprint and a lower price.

        <updated>2022-11-23T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon "Emblems," characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.]]></summary>

In this case, co-op is the way to go: specifically, something everyone can play in the same room on the same TV. But with so many games out there, how do you separate a perfect holiday gift from a dastardly holiday grift? Fret not! We've compiled a list of some of the best games to turn that seasonal boredom into wintertime wonderment.

That’s hundreds upon hundreds of pounds less than the average RTX 3080 laptop, even during the current season of early Black Friday offers. 


Until Nvidia get around to making a mobile version of the RTX 4080, this is the second-most powerful RTX laptop GPU you can get, so it’s much more commonly found inside £2000-plus models. Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed. And it’s not like the other components are guff: the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is a perfectly adequate octa-core CPU, and the Nitro 5 ignores slow mechanical storage to equip itself with a 1TB SSD.

They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.
There's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago I watched my Warzone Legacy, a two-minute-long compilation of my best stats from the first game, which included my K/D ratio and hours played and the like. It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.
My history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.

In the latter half alone we’ve seen the top-class PCIe 3.0 speeds of the Crucial P3, the surprising affordability of the PCIe 4.0-based Crucial P3 Plus, the outstanding premium-tier performance of the WD Black SN850X, and now the Samsung 990 Pro: an NVMe SSD with the fastest read speeds in the land.

That changed with RimWorld 1.4, which adds "cross-expansion integration", so now you can use the ideology system from the Ideology expansion to, for example, tell stories about people who have ideologies about the biotech from the biotech expansion.

If you go for the black model, that’s a £65 saving off the RRP, and it’s £95 off if you opt for the white version, which is £45 as well.
£45! And it's full-size to boot. There are always nice savings to be had among Black Friday’s gaming keyboard deals, but even then, the only way you’d normally see a mech board this cheap was if it was secondhand. And had keycaps missing. And was haunted, possibly by some kind of dismembered hand ghost.

Set in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. "Everything was a dive bar," Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. "It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was." His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard ("As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.
Back in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. "The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it," Popovich says.

Each new generation of Pokémon promises changes and iterations to the long-standing franchise formula. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet kick off the ninth generation of Pokémon games, offering some of the biggest changes to date. An open world, four-player co-op, and other additions effectively push the series forward in meaningful ways, but the technical shortcomings often break immersion and temper an otherwise strong Pokémon game.
The Pokémon formula remains mostly intact through Scarlet and Violet. Your main goals still involve catching, training,…]]></summary>

These new AMD server processors have shown stunnning performance with up to 96 cores per socket and beyond the increased core count is now up to 12 channels of DDR5-4800 memory and most significantly in the HPC space is the introduction of AVX-512 support with Zen 4. Even the 32-core high frequency Genoa performance has been dominating against Intel's current Xeon Scalable competition. While AMD EPYC Genoa brings very impressive gains generation-over-generation and against the current Xeon Ice Lake CPUs, curiosity got the best of me for seeing how the new AMD EPYC CPUs compare to AMD's original EPYC 1st Gen "Naples" flagship - the EPYC 7601 2P.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it's an easy one. Sometimes it's agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you're rolling with. While you're at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too. 
"Set across three shattered versions of the game's world, Trinity Fusion casts players in the role of the Hitchhiker, a cross-dim…]]></summary>

Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it's been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me's release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. 


"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized," Wingefores said in the statement. "The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition."
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an "internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups," but says that "it is not necessarily the last." 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It's a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn't too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here's the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game's procedurally generated gore system.

First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I've finished most of the main story, but I haven't fully explored the end and post-game content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.]]></summary>

New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.

The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
