As a pirate, there's nothing more enticing than than T-word. Here's how to find the Fursome Four fish locations and complete the quest.


The Grumpy Fishercat (yes, that's what he's called in the game) can be found at the northern tip of Straits Island, just north of Pawt Purvanna. Settle in, folks. The puns don't end here. After destroying the two pi-rat ships harassing him, chat him up to start The Furlorn Fishercat quest.


Your first task is to capture a nearby Blue Catfish. It's easy enough: Hop into the water and herd it to the nearby net. Once that's complete, the Fishercat tells you of the Fursome Four, a group of legendary fish hiding somewhere in…]]></summary>

How to get the Gloves of the Illuminator in Diablo 4


The Gloves of the Illuminator can be obtained either as a very rare world drop or a boss drop from Grigoire or The Beast in the Ice.


If you’re looking to get it as a world drop because you don’t have access to the ladder bosses yet, it’s best to try and play the endgame activities currently in the game. Such activities include Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, Helltides, PvP, Whisper Caches, and the newly introduced Infernal Hordes.

For those of you who would rather not have the game spoiled, here’s a spoiler-free summary of my thoughts: It’s Earth Defense Force 5 if one of its developers woke up from a fever dream with deranged inspiration for how to extend it by nearly 150 missions. Even if you finished EDF 5 a few months ago, you might go into EDF 6 and not see much has changed aside from more dirt, a new narrative, and a couple of other small additions. It is not much of an upgrade, but you couldn’t ask for a better continuation.

You can repair your motorcycle, as well as weapons and armor, and you can technically use the Pickaxe as a weapon, but can you repair it?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Unfortunately, you can’t repair the Pickaxe in Once Human. It’s one of the more puzzling things about the tool, besides perhaps the fact that it’s called a Pickaxe when it looks like an axe and can be used both to chop down trees and mine ore. However, don’t despair: As you unlock the different skills in your Cradle, you’ll learn to craft stronger Pickaxes that don’t deteriorate as quickly as your scrubby beginner one.


What can you do with your breaking Pickaxes in Once Human?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Don’t use your Pickaxes until they break! That will cause them to vanish from your inventory, lost forever. Instead, use them right up to the breaking point, then stash them away until you make a trip to town, where you can sell them for a few quick Energy Links. The sturdier Pickaxes are worth more money. 


It’s an odd little inconvenience, being unable to repair Pickaxes even though your base is filled with workbenches. Perhaps developer Starry Studio will decide to make the Pickaxe in Once Human repairable eventually. But for now, they’ve probably got other things higher on their priority list, like preparing for the coming server reset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each week in Destiny 2 brings a new Nightfall mission and a weapon to grind the god roll for. This is the go-to for most endgame players as you get access to some very strong Adept weapons sporting some fantastic perks.


One such weapon has a unique god roll thanks to its archetype, and it only comes around ever so often. Here's the god roll for the Undercurrent grenade launcher in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Undercurrent in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Undercurrent is part of the Wave Frame archetype of grenade launchers, which means the grenades it shoots send out a wave when they hit the ground. This damages all enemies in a line and makes the weapon great for ad clear. However, this also means the iconic build of running Disorienting Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, and Vorpal Weapon doesn't work. However, the following build does nicely:



Launcher Barrel: Quick Launch


Magazine: High-Velocity Rounds


Perk 1: Demolitionist


Perk 2: Voltshot



Quick Launch lets you get that shot out from the Undercurrent much faster, giving better weapon ready speed and projectile speed for a good combination. High-Velocity Rounds expands on that, giving you an even faster reload and projectile speed for follow-up shots. Demolitionist makes for a great flow between regenerating your grenade charge, throwing it out, and then repeating the process with a reloaded grenade launcher. Finally, there's Voltshot, which seriously improves the ad clear potential through jolt.


If running this with a grenade build isn't your forte, then Ambitious Assassin is a great alternative perk, provided you can get several kills with one grenade. You could also run Lead from Gold to seriously improve your ammo economy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive announced today that the new Stellaris: Cosmic Storms expansion for the sci-fi strategy game is set to launch via PC on September 10, 2024. The new expansion brings new technologies and edicts to respond to the new Cosmic Storm threat as well as the all-new Storm Chaser origin and two new precursor stories.




While storm systems already exist in Stellaris, the new Cosmic Storms expansion adds 8 new types of Cosmic Storms that replace the existing Space Storms and randomly spawn across the map. The new Cosmic Storms are Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud, and Nexus. The storms will automatically grow, shrink, and change speeds as they work their way across the galaxy.


Alongside the storms is the new Storm Chaser Origin, an empire of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. As such, they strive for enlightenment by engaging with the new fierce Cosmic Storms that the universe sends at them.


With the new Storm Chaser Origin comes three new civics: Astrometeorology, Storm Devotion, and Environmental Architects. There are also two new precursor stories that discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaris Convention of Benevolence. Completing each narrative will unlock a new relic.


Stellaris: Cosmic Storms will be released on PC via Steam on September 10, 2024, at the price point of $12.99. It's part of the Season 8 Season Pass and will also be added to the monthly Expansion Subscription for Stellaris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's Salvation's Edge raid weapons are all rather unique, if not in function then definitely in appearance. Each one is about as weird as the visuals of the raid itself, not that this makes them any less powerful.


Among them is a new sword that, while not including Eager's Edge, has a rather potent DPS combo for certain boss fights: The Summum Bonum.


Here's the god roll for the Summum Bonum sword in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Summum Bonum sword sports the highly sought-after Wave Frame archetype, allowing its heavy attacks to send out a wave in front of you. This gives your sword a little range if you either get pushed back or are still approaching the enemy. The following perks and attachments should pair nicely with it:



Blade: Hungry Edge


Guard: Balanced Guard


Perk 1: Relentless Strikes


Perk 2: Chaos Reshaped



Hungry Edge immediately provides max sword ammo, which is something swords tend to struggle a lot with. Any buff there helps a ton. Balanced Guard gives a much better guard, though you shouldn't worry about ittoo much since you won't be using it. Relentless Strikes is where things get interesting since it gives back sword ammo on continuous light swings---which you'll be doing many of. Finally, we have Chaos Reshaped, increasing damage based on how long you're in combat. A great buff for boss DPS.


How to get the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


The Summum Bonum comes from the new Salvation's Edge raid. It can drop from the second encounter (Herald of Finality), the fourth encounter (Verity), or the fifth one (The Witness). On top of this, the object that appears after defeating The Witness lets you spend 20 Spoils of Conquest to get a deepsight version of whatever weapon you want, including the Summum Bonum. Getting five of these grants you the ability to craft it.

Publisher The Arcade Crew and developer Assoupi have revealed a brand-new platformer called Mainframes. It's a refreshingly unique take on the genre in which you take on the role of Floppy who, in an effort to discover its true function, sets off on a quest of self-identity.
The cool thing with this one is that the levels are essentially built to look like a computer desktop, with the platforms being actual program windows that you can alter at will. You'll encounter cute characters on your journey and relax to some lighthearted music tracks that feel perfectly suited to the pixel art world.

This is a great card especially for beginners as it's pretty easy to obtain. There's just one task, and it's really easy to get the required fodder as well. Let's take a look at how good the new card is, and if you should invest your resources in it. 


EA FC 24 Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC tasks


The solo task has certain conditions that you'll need to meet while submitting the squad. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Min. Team Rating: 88


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW



EA FC 24 Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC solutions


The Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC can be completed for about 40,000 coins. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Mapi Leon: 89


Irene Paredes: 88


Victor Osimhen: 88


Any 88-rated TOTS/TOTW card


Marie Katoto: 88


Jan Oblak: 88


Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87


Lina Magull: 87


Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87


Lea Schuller: 86



Compared to women goalkeepers, Murphy has decent height at 6 ft. However, I am not comfortable using anyone apart from a really tall goalkeeper in my team. It suits well considering the aerial meta of the game at the moment. That said, a 97-rated card can be incredibly useful to complete SBCs like Mia Hamm Icon or David Ginola Heroes. If you have the spare fodder, which you should, make sure to complete this FUTTIES SBC.

We've separated our Old School RuneScape Skills Tier List into two different categories: free-to-play and members. The game's paid content is so much more in-depth that it's difficult to directly compare the two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wholesome Games Steam event is here to announce new games and spotlight current releases, and one of today's reveals is Ritual of Raven. This witchy farming sim comes from Spellgarden Games, who previously worked on Sticky Business. It's currently due out through publisher Team17 sometime in 2025.


Beyond Steam, Ritual of Raven is eyeing a release on Nintendo Switch. Spellgarden is aiming for maximum coziness with this one, as previewed in the announcement trailer below.




Ritual of Raven describes itself as a farming sim, but you actually collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to work on your magical herb garden for you. While these magical creatures help grow ingredients for rituals, it's up to you to embark upon quests, befriend various characters, and get to tradin'. You'll also want to suss out what's up with all these portals that have been popping up throughout the land.


If the crux of your coziness lies in customization, it seems there's plenty of it to go around here. You can decorate your farm as you see fit, and you can also apply a bunch of customization options to the wider world of magic beyond your farm's borders.


Enchanting ingredients

So far, it all looks like it's eyeing a nice balance between chill sim gameplay and a touch of mystery lurking around the edges. If you want to try it out for yourself and happen to be heading to gamescom, Ritual of Raven will be playable at the event. Look for the demo at the Indie Arena Booth in Hall 10.2 | F010 E019 for all your occult-adjacent cultivating needs.

If you’ve ever lost track of time decorating your farmhouse and passed out, only to wake up in the void of black space the next morning, then this patch is going to come as a relief to you---and for those who managed to accidentally put their Worn Tools in a Shipping Bin and have been stuck without tools, you’ll be happy to know that this update also fixes that issue and many more. 


It’s worth noting that this is not an update intended to bring more features to the game, such as those mentioned in the Early Access roadma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Undercover R&B episode, you'll take control of Version 1.1's newest up-and-coming character, Jane Doe. She's on a secret mission involving the Mountain Lion Gang, where she eventually stumbles upon a locker that requires a code. To get you back on track, we'll show you the correct passcode in Zenless Zone Zero's Undercover R&B Special Episode.


Zenless Zone Zone Undercover R&B six-digit code, explained


According to the note near the locker, clues can be found throughout the room to determine the correct passcode. More specifically, it mentions how frequently shown numbers are the key to solving this puzzle. If you look at the piece of paper in the office, you'll see that the six-digit code 101225 appears the most, which is the correct passcode to the ZZZ Undercover R&B episode.


If you're having trouble entering this room, you can go through the gates on the right side of the counter. However, some players have indicated that these gates wouldn't allow access. In this case, restart the game and try to go through it again to fix the issue.

Once the locker opens, head to the equipment room and grab the master keycard. The path from here is relatively straightforward, but you'll still need the Port Peak videotape to satisfy the gangster's request. You can find it in the Proxy's main hub at Random Play.


Although the Proxy will take point at this stage, you'll play as Jane Doe again in the next phase. It's the perfect chance to get familiar with her combat and movement, as she will appear as a banner in the second half of Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you and your friends have the dream of managing NFL teams, Madden NFL 25's Franchise mode is the perfect option to test yourselves (albeit on the virtual platform).


I love playing the Franchise mode as a solo journey, where I am up against the AI managers. But there's an option to conduct a league between you and your friends, where each of you takes charge of a franchise. Let's take a look at the exact steps of setting up a multiplayer league and how your friends can join them.


How to create a multiplayer league with Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode


Creating a multiplayer league in Madden NFL 25 isn't very different from a solo league.



Open and load the game.


Select Franchise.


Go to League Creation and pick the second option.


Select the franchise of your choice.


Proceed to the next stage to open league settings. Here, you can tweak different settings, including making it public or private (password-protected).






To play with your friends, make sure to create a private league. The maximum number of users is 32. Next, note down the league name and password and share it with your friends.


If you or your friend want to join a league, they can do so from the Franchise mode as well. They will have to enter the league name and password to join the league. Once they're in, they can pick a franchise of their liking and continue with the different aspects of management.


That's pretty much it when it comes to playing Franchise mode with your friends. Just make sure to coordinate and decide who's picking which franchise so there's no quarrel about it later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts released an all-new trailer for the upcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard today that showed glimpses of what to expect from the first title in the series in almost a decade. The focus of the trailer, however, was to indicate when we can expect to get our hands on The Veilguard: October 31, 2024.




Even though we've had to wait almost 10 years to get back to Dragon Age, the wait is almost over. With a Halloween 2024 release date that means we're just 2.5 months away from getting our hands on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.


Surely not coincidentally, the story in The Veilguard takes place a decade after the events of its predecessor, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of Rook and his companions as they put an end to a ritual in progress by Solas, one of your allies and party members from Inquisition who has become a villain. However, doing so breaks free the corrupt Elven gods who are hellbent on blighting the world, and it's now up to you and your party to fight back against the ancient rulers.


For those interested in freshening up on their Dragon Age lore and knowledge, all of the Dragon Age games are currently on sale for 90% off on all platforms through August 19 as part of the ongoing Electronic Arts August sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pounce Light has announced that its free-form scene creator, Tiny Glade, now has a release date. It’s hitting PC on September 14, 2024.


Tiny Glade (I keep writing “Grove”) is a cozy game where you construct little buildings using an impressively intuitive editor. There’s no judgement (no “wrong answers” as the developer says), so the goal is to simply create scenes that please you. Maybe pet the sheep while you’re at it.




The unique hook here is its editor. It’s not grid-based, and features that you place adapt to being morphed. The structure adapts to objects placed, such as windows, so it’s all about plopping and dragging. It’s a game that really sells itself because even watching the trailer and the gifs on the store page is satisfying. 


I’m someone whose mind has been polluted enough by modernity that I feel the need to have some sort of progression, and it doesn’t look like Tiny Glade has that, but the creation kit alone has me wanting to play it. Considering the fact that poor life choices have practically ensured that I will never own a home of my own, the idea of being able to easily create one from my imagination is appealing.


Tiny Glade had an impressive demo this past May’s Steam Next Fest. Paula Vaynshteyn gave it a look and came away with a craving for more.


We won’t have to wait long, as Tiny Glade launches on PC September 14, 2024.

Its biggest downside, really, is the lacking and somewhat fiddly support for third-party launchers, though a new Decky plugin aims to solve that, too.


While it's certainly possible (and not even very difficult) to run virtually any modern third-party game launcher or storefront on the Steam Deck, it's not something everyone will be comfortable setting up. That's where SteamDeckBro's NonSteamLaunchers plugin for the Decky Storefront comes into the picture, letting users quickly and easily install any third-party launchers they want and then use them to import games into the Deck's Game Mode without any added fuss.

As a result of some noted challenges recently, Steam has decided to make some changes to the description pages, making new rules about what studios can and cannot put in these sections. These changes will be rolling out in "early September," so devs have a bit of time to make any alterations to their own product description pages.




The rules will affect the "About the Game," "Short Description," "Special Announcement," and "Awards" sections, and are as follows:

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

Elrentaros Wanderings is a brand-new game from Rune Factory creator Yoshifumi Hashimoto and his studio, Hakama, which takes place across two parallel worlds: one in a present-day Japanese school, and one in a fantasy land where a small village is plagued by monsters that live in nearby dungeons.
Your character — male or female — must be the one to clear out these dungeons, making friends with the locals and upgrading weapons to take on progressively harder dungeons. But sometimes, when you go to sleep at night, you wake up in that parallel universe... and all the characters seem like the ones you just got to know in the village. How strange!

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

Publisher Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced The Knightling, a 3D action-adventure game heavily inspired by Zelda in which you take on the role of the titular Knightling in a quest that arms you with just a shield.
Utilising a semi-open world structure, you'll be free to explore to your hearts' content by utilising your shield across several different scenarios. You can use it yo fight against enemies, transform it into a makeshift parasol, or slide down mountains, proper Breath of the Wild style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

One man has set a Guinness World Record for having the highest number of unique, working video game consoles connected to one TV. Talk about putting your collection to work... (thanks to our friends at Time Extension for spotting this!)
Ibrahim Al-Nasser, from Saudi Arabia, has managed to connect 444 video game consoles — each one different — to a single TV. And every single one works, too. Is it a fire hazard? Maybe. But we're more worried about all of those wires behind the TV. Though Al-Nasser has a method of keeping all of the cables hidden and tidy behind there. Plus, Al-Nasser hooks them all up using around 30 RCA switchers, 12 HDMI switchers, converters, and more.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia's Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top tier French football leagues, Ligue 1 McDonald's and Ligue 2 BKT, have obtained a new court order to block dozens of pirate IPTV platforms. As presented on the Paris Judicial Court's website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

Well, root my toots. Unless you’re Australian, in which case don't do that. Just enjoy the now very much confirmed-looking release of the original Red Dead Redemption on PC. That’s according to a listing on the PlayStation Store, which contains the currently inaccurate but tantalising phrase “now on PC for the first time ever.”

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

Or was "Purr-ibean" the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has "furr-ocious spells" and "gla-meow-rous costumes".

It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point every proud ruler must ask themselves the question: what should I do with all this stupid, tiresome civilisation I've built? Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

Of all graphic novels sold in the U.S. during 2023, half were manga. Of those who consume manga digitally in Japan, the most prolific are the over 50s; half read manga every day. Estimates show that over 1,300 pirate sites offer manga and in a recent single month, 100 new pirate manga sites appeared online. Cost to the industry: $800m per month.

Tests carried on several ISPs in Malaysia this week reveal that requests to Cloudflare and Google public DNS servers are being hijacked and diverted to local ISP DNS servers.

Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but Victory Heat Rally feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uruguay's Ministry of Industry issued a decree in October 2022 which heralded the country's first pirate site blocking program. Since then the country has blocked over 300 pirate domains following requests from various broadcasters. Some other figures of interest; in December 2022, there were around 573,000 pay TV subscribers in Uruguay. A year later that figure had fallen to 496,000. Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  RPG Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves.

That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

This happened on July 26th, and while Gematsu speculate this might be related to the next game in the Yakuza: Like A Dragon series, I have other plans. For the imaginary game. That I have nothing to do with.

Over the weekend, the discovery of a mystery Valve project called "White Sands" on a voice actor's portfolio has set tongues and fingers wagging about potential Half-Life news in the offing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week's mass layoffs at Destiny studio Bungie were planned out months ago, former employees have told journalist Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled). According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian's first-person action-RPG Avowed is one of our 75 most anticipated games of 2024, but according to a report, it's been booted back into early 2025 to avoid a "very busy period" on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.

I caught a brief presentation earlier in the week and yeah, this seems promising. On the one hand, it reminds me of cheery 16-bit hop 'n' boppers like, say, the Mega Drive adaptation of Disney's Aladdin.
