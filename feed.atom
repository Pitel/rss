With it comes one highly-requested change, lower stash tab costs. Additionally, the patch notes outline tons of other changes, including balancing abilities, many bug fixes, and more. With the ability to purchase 100 tabs for your stash, lowering the cost might be the best thing Eleventh Hour Games has done yet. It was getting expensive for me to hoard every cool item I could find.

Players in Last Epoch, like many ARPGs, have a stash treasure chest they can fill with items. It gives you the ability to save items for later, maybe to try another build or revert back to old gear or weapons at any time. One of the best features in the ga…]]></summary>

Chiori’s primary source of damage is the dolls conjured by her Skill. Using her Skill creates a doll named Tamoto. Tamoto stays on-field when Chiori switches out and will automatically attack enemies once every 3.6 seconds for a total of four hits.

A Difficult Game About Climbing, developed and published by developer Pontypants, was released on Steam on March 6 and has received a lot of hate-filled yet very positive reviews on the platform. Commenters say things like “10/10, I hate it”, “I hate this game so much”, and “I want to jump off a cliff” while still recommending the game, it can be a confusing prospect to those who have never encountered a rage game like it before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would argue Sea of Stars was the best indie game of 2023. I'd even go as far as saying it deserved more space in the game of the year conversation, but that's an argument for another time. With 5 million copies sold, Sabotage Studio has announced a new co-op mode coming to the RPG in a future update.


Sea of Stars is getting three-player couch co-op


Sea of Stars just surpassed 5 million copies sold, and as a reward, players are getting 'Single Player+' mode, teased in a new trailer. The short version is that it will allow players to team up with two friends locally on their RPG adventure. Since the indie game plays like a classic turn-based RPG, how will that work?





"Staying true to the game’s core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'Co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars’ grand adventure. The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon."
Sabotage Studio



A new reason to go back and play Sea of Stars again sounds good to me. Along with the ability to play with a few buddies, we also get some new combat and traversal mechanics, though they haven't been thoroughly explained just yet. 'Co-op timed hits' likely refer to the attack and defense timing, which require the player to tap a button right when their character makes contact with an attack or the enemy attack hits. This results in extra damage on attack and significantly lowered damage taken on defense. Using context clues, it seems that in co-op, those bonuses will require all players to perfectly time the hits.


That should make for chaotic gameplay and probably plenty of arguments. Isn't that exactly what you want out of a couch co-op experience?

It's not often that a developer gets to revisit a chapter of their past and pick up where they left off on a project two decades prior, but the revival of Shantae Advance in the form of Risky Revolution has given WayForward creative director Matt Bozon just that opportunity.
Having co-created the character with his partner, Erin Bozon, the second game in the series following Shantae's Game Boy Color 2002 debut was started but shelved after WayForward struggled to find a publisher. However, with the help of Limited Run Games, the developers are now revisiting this 'lost' chapter in the series, with the now-completed game getting a limited-time release on Game Boy Advance and a wider modern console release courtesy of Limited Run's Carbon Engine later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free.

After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lucky Egg's double XP capabilities are one of the most beneficial elements for trainer ranks. However, given that it only lasts 30 minutes, timing is crucial for the entire process. So, if you aren't quite sure how to utilize the item, we'll show the best time to use a Lucky Egg in Pokémon Go.


Best time to use a Lucky Egg in Pokemon Go


Trainers can use the Lucky Eggs for the following objectives in Pokémon Go:



Friendship Levels (Ultra Friends or Best Friends)


Catching and evolving Pokemon


Special events


Special Research tasks


Seven-day streaks


Raids



The first option allows you to earn double XP when reaching a certain point for a Friendship Level. I recommend increasing companionships with gift exchanges initially and then using the Lucky Egg when it's about to reach Ultra Friends or Best Friends. Preparations are a good way to go in order to maximize the egg's benefits. In particular, it's an excellent idea to catch Weedles, Pidgeys, and Caterpies beforehand, as they don't require too much Candy for the evolution (another way to get XP).


Special Events, such as seasonal or recurring celebrations, prolong the Lucky Egg's abilities. This also includes Special Research tasks, so don't claim those rewards until the double XP activates. Catching Pokémon during this time helps, too, but it all must be done within 30 minutes. 


If you keep up with Pokémon Go, seven-day streaks are another useful way to take advantage of the eggs. Simply log in every day and catch some creatures to reach that point. Although it will take a while, it all adds up with the right timing. That said, Raids may not be the best choice for the Lucky Eggs since these events can go on longer. It's just an alternative method for those who want a challenge and extra XP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

One of the most possibly useful consumable items of the bunch is the Celestial Dew, as it bestows upon the player the power to revive NPCs and thus correct some, ugh, possible "accidents" that might occur during the main quest. 


You might end up never needing Celestial Dew, but this is the Lands Between, a place where it's just best to be prepared for everything at all times, so let's see where to find it.

You can find Celestial Dew not in one, but in many places in Elden Ring, so I'll just leave you with all of the known locations below in descending order of easier to hardest to get:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long wait for the PC release of Final Fantasy XVI may be over sooner rather than later, according to comments made by producer Naoki Yoshida, but it seems as though the game will require some pretty hefty hardware in order to play. 


The PC port of FFXVI is currently in “the final stages of [optimization]”, according to Yoshida, who goes on to say that “in a game where loading speed is critical, a HDD would be a pain … please consider that an SSD is a must”. 


In a recent discussion, Yoshida suggested that a demo for the game would be coming before the full release, which at least gives players a chance to test whether the game will run on their current setup.

There have been no solid words on the exact specifications that will be needed to play FF16 on PC, but there’s hope that the current optimization process will lower the entry barrier in order to get more people playing. 


With regards to a solid release date for the game on PC, Yoshida has said that “it won’t be too distant in the future”, before suggesting that we won’t be waiting more than 12 months, provided optimization goes smoothly. 


Back when Final Fantasy XVI was released on Playstation 5 in June 2023, it was very well received and earned high-scoring reviews. Clive will even be making an appearance in FFXIV during the “The Path Infernal” collaboration event, set to take place in early April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The community-based Major Order quests offer challenging adventures across Super Earth for the chance to earn some much-needed rewards. Unfortunately, not everything runs smoothly with these missions, as many players have experienced issues in their progression. So, if you want to know how to fix Helldivers 2 Major Order not updating, here's what you need to do.


Helldivers 2 Major Order not updating, troubleshooting, fix


There's been a lot of confusion surrounding the Major Order quests, causing many to think these objectives are bugged (and I'm not just talking about the ones on the planets.) However, since MO missions are community-based, they must be achieved globally rather than individually. That means your team and other players must contribute to the corresponding planets bit by bit until each location has been liberated. 


Hover over the planet to check the progress of the current Major Order. For example, the Activate the Terminid Control System quest conveys a TCS Installation Progress bar on Erata Prime, Fenrir III, Meridia, and Turing. Once those have been liberated, the Major Order will be completed. 


A previous quest requiring eight Defend Campaigns' completion also stirred up some confusion, as many players attempted to achieve it while the Major Order did not update. This is where the community-based requirements come into play again, considering that it actually means finishing eight planets with Defend Campaigns. 


Helldivers 2's Major Orders change over time, and these tasks will, of course, shift along with it. So, remember that they must be completed globally instead of the standard individual objectives. Also, ensure you claim the mission rewards, which will be sent to your account.

By the time players reach the title city, she’s had a falling out with fellow conspirator Gortash. 


Both offer the party a deal. Gortash offers an honest alliance with them to take the Absolute for themselves in exchange for Orin’s head. Orin meanwhile kidnaps one of the playable companions and threatens to kill them unless the party eliminates Gortash. 


Since this is Baldur’s Gate 3, players have multiple ways of rescuing their kidnapped companion. Here are some methods to ensure your party doesn’t go down a number.

Sabotage Studio has announced that its hit RPG Sea of Stars has now surpassed 5 million players worldwide since its launch on 29th August, 2023. To celebrate, it has teased a new 3 player couch co-op mode officially dubbed 'Single Player+'.
While the short video above just demonstrates basic traversal for the time being, in which you can see the blue-haired Solstice Warrior Valere being brought back into the fold via a handy bubble, Sabotage notes that co-op will allow three players to engage in a new 'Co-Op Timed Hits' mechanic. This, presumably, will entail each player taking turns in combat and working together during specific attacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Arts Games has announced that Bushiroad's Macross: Shooting Insight will be coming to PS4, PS5, and Switch in North America this year.


Ironically, we’ve thus far not been given much insight into the game, which was initially announced in Japan last year. If you’re not familiar, the original Macross series was adapted as Robotech here in North America and was one of the earliest anime that a lot of people saw. The company localizing it, Harmony Gold, then brought over two unrelated anime series and tied them all together in a redub since the OVAs that followed Macross were too short for American standards, and they wanted some sort of continuation immediately. It was something that made sense in the ‘80s before the internet.




Macross: Shooting Insight might be the first proper game of the series to make it to North America. In 2002, we got Robotech: Battlecry (which I actually enjoyed), but that was based on the English adaptation and was developed by American developer Vicious Cycle Software. Some in the West may have played the Famicom Macross, however, because it was a mainstay on multi-game pirate cartridges.


For Macross: Shooting Insight, it will be a scrolling shoot-’em-up. There has been some trailers of the gameplay, but they all just show variables fighting things against a generic starfield. I’m hoping that’s not completely indicative of the gameplay.


The story follows characters from a few of the series (7, Plus, Zero, Frontier, and Delta) after a fold in space-time brings them all together. One unique feature has you use the power of songs to gain an edge in battle!” You’re joined by songstresses from the various series. I guess that makes sense, but it makes them sound like bards from Dungeons and Dragons.


Macross: Shooting Insight will be coming to PS4, PS5, and Switch in North America sometime this year.

Will there be a Rise of the Ronin co-op mode?


Team Ninja and PlayStation confirmed back in February that Rise of the Ronin co-op will be in place. You can invite three other players to join you. 


"Rise of the Ronin allows up to three players to experience the game’s story missions together in online co-op," says the official PlayStation page. Thankfully, it won't be limited to co-op-specific missions like Ghost of Tsushima and Granblue Fantasy Relink. You can play the full game with your buddies. It will be interesting to see your fellow samurai in-game as you create your own characters before taking on this journey. 


Is Rise of the Ronin on PS4?


If you have friends who haven't upgraded to the PS5 yet, they unfortunately can't play Rise of the Ronin co-op with you on a PS4. They'll need to get PlayStation's latest system. Thankfully, a slimmer version just released because the original PS5 is massive (believe me, I had to travel with it across the world to live in England). 


If you're sad you can't play Rise of the Ronin with them, you can check out the co-op mode Ghost of Tsushima: Legends. 


Is Rise of the Ronin on PlayStation Plus Extra? 


Like many PlayStation exclusives at launch, Rise of the Ronin is only available for purchase at the time of writing. It won't be on the PlayStation Plus Extra library. However, you will need a PlayStation Plus subscription to play Rise of the Ronin online with friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No doubt about it, Unreal Engine is probably the world's most popular video game development toolkits. It's also free to use, with Epic Games taking a cut whenever games earn above a certain threshold. However, if you're a non-game company, you will need to pay for the software soon enough.


In a recent news post over on the Unreal Engine website, a new pricing scheme is being introduced with the release of version 5.4 in April. This will only affect those who are working on non-gaming projects, but there are at least a few additional criteria to go with that.




The post goes on to say that non-game outfits will need to pay a "seat based" fee on an annual basis, but only if they meet the following:



You are a company that generates over $1 million in annual gross revenue


You do not create games


And you do not create applications licensed to third-party end users and rely on Unreal Engine code at runtime



Fear not, video game studios


The price "per seat" will be $1,850 and – just to reiterate – is only intended for companies that are using Unreal for something that's not a game. Examples given include linear content for film and TV, "immersive experiences" that aren't sold to the public, such as theme park rides, and products that "incorporate Unreal Engine code at runtime and are not licensed to third parties."


However, if you're a games company, the new pricing structure will not affect you. In the past, Epic Games has charged a 5% fee for any titles powered by UE that earn over $1 million in "lifetime gross revenue". This is not being changed.


Unreal Engine will also continue to be free for "students, educators, hobbyists, and companies generating less than $1 million in annual gross revenue." Are you hearing this, Unity?

Following the game's first patch, various planetary hazards were introduced to missions. This can include ground tremors, volcanic activity, a meteor shower, or tornados made of fire. It's those tremors that have piqued the interest of fans most recently, though.

This review originally went live in 2014, and we're updating and republishing it to celebrate the game's arrival in Switch's Game Boy (Color) library via Nintendo Switch Online.

For whatever its name is worth, Mario Tennis doesn’t feature a lot of the red guy — at least at first. That may come as an initial disappointment to some who were drawn to the M-word. Now, if you came for the 'tennis' part, well, that’s a whole different story.

If you were unaware of said mod, it's a Patron-funded expansion that puts Dark Souls 3 on an alternate storyline in a way akin to Demon Souls, with a hub area home to five gateways that'll transport you to five worlds. If there was ever a reason to return to Dark Souls 3, this is probably it.

We had a great time with Tomb Raider I-III Remastered when it landed on Switch last month. Sure, some sections of the original trilogy are showing their age a little today, but for the most part, these were the same old adventures that we came to love in the late '90s with a tasty boost in the visual department.
These visual upgrades were all well and good, but one problem that many-a player stumbled across while raiding those tombs was a certain issue of visibility, particularly with the all-important keys.

        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

Evening Star's new 3D platformer Penny's Big Breakaway got off to a solid start when it arrived last month, but notably was capped at 30FPS. Fortunately, this is set to change in the next update, with developer Christian Whitehead confirming the upcoming console update will unlock the Switch frame rate.
This will allow players to choose between 30FPS and a 60FPS option. It will be similar to Bomb Rush Cyberfunk (which could mean this frame rate may not necessarily maintain silky-smooth performance), but it will at least be an option. This update will also add anti-aliasing to 30FPS.

With its efforts on Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and The Making of Karateka, developer Digital Eclipse is cementing itself as a true pioneer in the interactive documentary space. Truth be told, it’s a niche that the studio completely owns at this point, and though we’re surprised other major players in the video game industry have yet to dive into it themselves, we can’t imagine anybody tackling the form without sneaking a few cheeky glances at Digital Eclipse’s work.
Following on from Karateka, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story is the second in the Gold Master Series and takes a deep dive into the career and mind of Jeff Minter (sometimes referred to as ‘Yak’), an English video game designer and programmer who founded Llamasoft. Though well-known within the industry and by veteran players, you could be forgiven for not knowing a great deal about Minter beyond some of his more famous works, including Tempest 2000, Gridrunner, Akka Arrh, and Attack of the Mutant Camels. That’s where Digital Eclipse comes in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Alongside the release date announcement for Monster Hunter Stories, Capcom revealed a "special set" containing the original game and sequel. Its official website also confirmed this "collection" would be getting a physical release in the US.

The Xbox and Obsidian title Pentiment was recently updated for all platforms and it seems the Switch version has had an icon change. It was originally a giant portrait of the title's protagonist.
This icon didn't really look the part alongside other eShop icons, so the developer has now updated it to the default Pentiment artwork (which you can see above) with the title of the game at the bottom of the icon. Here's a look, courtesy of Twitter user and YouTube channel 'SuperNintendad':

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/final-fantasy-xs-theme-song-to-zanarkand-wasnt-originally-intended-for-the-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-12T16:25:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound
After that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster.

It is indeed a strange, dream-like experience where you leap floaty leaps onto thin, spindly crags of rock in a sage-grey void. Rather than finding it soothing, I found it it extremely stress-making.

In perhaps the least shocking news of MAR10 Day 2024, Nintendo revealed that another Super Mario Bros. Movie is on the way and it's coming in 2026.
A sequel should come as no surprise, let's not forget that the first film pulled in 168 million views at the global box office and went on to become one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time. Yet there was something about Miyamoto's announcement that suggested things might not be quite as cookie-cutter as we'd expected — "We are now creating a new animated film based on the world of Super Mario Bros." and "We're thinking about broadening Mario's world further". Hmmm.

A cinematic trailer shows off the now white-haired Akuma’s new look and his apparent mastery of the art of punching giant statues to rubble. We’ll have to wait to see gameplay, but this teaser certainly sets the mood for the brooding warrior.

        <updated>2024-03-12T14:16:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular pirate streaming site Vumoo.to was taken down by its operator this weekend, in response to enforcement action by anti-piracy group ACE. With more than 12 million monthly visits, Vumoo was one of the more popular piracy portals. The site was presumably being operated from Vietnam, where many of the largest pirate sites and services still reside today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arrowhead Game Studios is releasing a new patch for Helldivers 2 today that nerfs the spawn rate of heavily armored Terminid bug enemies like Chargers and Bile Titans alongside some other changes that should make fighting these enemies, especially on harder difficulties, easier. Set to go live today on PlayStation 5 and PC, Patch 1.000.102 follows a patch from last week that introduced fire tornadoes, meteor showers, weapon buffs, and more to the shooter. 
"Good day citizens of Super Earth," the patch notes read. "A new patch to aid you in your efforts is coming in. May Super Earth give you courage. Today's patch is dealing with the spawn rate of heavily armored Terminid enemies as well as the possible play against them. It also contains some fixes to U.I. elements and crash fixe…]]></summary>

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

You can imagine my intrigue when I saw that Tents And Trees, a picross-ish puzzle game previously on Switch and phones, is coming to PC on April 24th. That's a couple of months away, but you can play the short demo on Steam now to get a taste. It's slick and clean, and I like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a bit about playing Helldivers 2 as a solo diver, noting that Arrowhead's frenetic shooter holds up surprisingly well when you rudely insist on treating it like an open world stealth sim, a la Metal Gear Solid V. The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems only fitting that Ghostbusters has become the movie franchise that refuses to die, returning for a smattering of so-so (at best) reboots and sequels on screen and elsewhere being relegated to another rich vein of nostalgia to be mined for cash. Speaking of, Destiny 2 is getting Ghostbusters cosmetics next week!

It seems that the earlier battle royale game is planning to borrow at least one leaf from its rival’s playbook this year, though.

IIPA said there was an implied bias towards the protection of domestic content, leaving U.S. content unprotected. In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil.

        <id>122184</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/GameGauntlet2024"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

Plus the Moomin merch I'd seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would've been jealous.
And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you're after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

When I spoke to producer Naoki Yoshida about it in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices for Game Informer's FFXVI cover story last year, he said players shouldn't expect the PC version anytime soon. 
With FFXVI's first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, already out, and its second DLC, The Rising Tide, due out this spring, I spoke to Yoshida once more about the PC version. I also talked to him and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about The Rising Tide and what players can expect, and you can read Game Informer's exclusive preview here.

The games join the Game Boy library, which is included with the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 a year).
Dr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog. The collection already includes the likes of Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, Kirby's Dream Land 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, and Metroid II – Return of Samus. Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released more than a decade ago, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a little tricky to go back to in 2024 thanks to its 3DS exclusivity. However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.
When it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.


Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beloved GameCube RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, finally has a release date for Switch. Announced during September 2023's Nintendo Direct, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is regarded by many as the pinnacle of Mario's RPG outings, and since today is Mario Day, Nintendo took the opportunity to let fans know when they'd be able to play the remaster on Nintendo's hybrid console.
We still don't have many details for this version, but we do know that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features improved graphics. It joins a collection of titles starring Mario and his friends over the last several months, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Princess Peach: Showtime, and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/10/new-super-mario-bros-animated-movie-announced-for-2026-release"/>
        <updated>2024-03-10T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.
While the announcement stops short of calling this "Super Mario Bros. 2" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. "As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more," Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. "This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.
What do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While speaking to Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices last year for Game Informer's cover story on the game, he told me there was currently no plans for DLC. However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. 
The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a good management game, but my definition of "good" often includes words like "detailed", "complex", or "dangerously all-consuming". That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to think we should bury Vampire: The Masquerade back in the forsaken graveyard where it was originally dug up, or at least banish the toothy reprobate back to its pen & paper castle. I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.
The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.

March 8, 2024
Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.]]></summary>

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…]]></summary>

I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, "beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of launching Dragon's Dogma 2 later this month, Capcom have released its character creator for free as a separate standalone doodad. You can create your character and your main Pawn (NPC sidekick) and save them to use in the full game. Or, if you're like me and cannot resist playing for hours in a character creator, you can enjoy fiddling with its many sliders and marvelling at the breadth of options like 334 different colours for its four eye colour settings and the ability to remove individual teeth. I made my kitten as my pal, because I guess that's what I do now.

Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite: Chapter 5 was a huge launch for the long-running battle royale developed by Epic Games. Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.
As Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. 
Prepare thyselves, mere mortals!

Unfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. 
In the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month. After that, read about how Disney and Epic Games are partnering up to create a games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-season-2-launches-next-week-with-new-cutting-edge-warbond"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T14:57:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new "Cutting Edge" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with "high-voltage vibes," giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. 
Warbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new "Acquisitions" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. 
Check out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: 


Within this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with "wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts." The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the "end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'"
In terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. 
You can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. 

Elsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. 
Cutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. 
The trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

However, I recently had the chance to meet with publisher Bandai Namco and developer Reflector Entertainment to learn more about the game and see the first gameplay footage.

After we finally got a proper look at 11 bit Studios' beautifully brutal follow-up last year, we now know when we’ll be able to brave the unforgiving tundra and the nightmarish climate of, uh, July?

The result wasn't close but was closer than I expected, which shows why it's important to ask. We're doing important work here, you and I. This week, it's a question of mitts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.  First announced in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.
A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  


Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass). You can read our review of the first Frostpunk here.]]></summary>

But their latest venture - created in partnership with developers Chibig and Inverge Studios, and co-written by Rhianna Pratchett - is drastically different. Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About eight months ago, Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.
The action is defined as "dancing swords," but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.


Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.]]></summary>

The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last July, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XIV, the critically acclaimed and long-running MMORPG, would be coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. 
This news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. 


The timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 
Before Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game.

That includes, from what we can tell, sucking people's souls out of their bodies and telepathically blasting enemies through destructible environments. Haroona can also pull enemies, control their minds, and more. The game also features parkour-style platforming across an Indian city.

Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Barrels' co-optional horror "therapy" simulator The Outlast Trials leaves early access today. I haven't played an Outlast game since reviewing the second numbered game and having excitable opinions about its portrayal of the moon. I'll be honest, I'd assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game's mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation.

The sentences are described as 'historic' since they target corporate actors rather than private individuals. However, background to the case makes this case historic for entirely different reasons.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

After the closure, a former Free Radical developer revealed they'd worked on a "clone" of Fortnite before it transitioned to a remake of Timesplitters 2. And now footage has emerged of the cancelled project, which certainly does look like a team shooter reminiscent of Epic's epic.

A joint motion for a $2.4m judgment in favor of Nintendo was filed on Monday. The cost to the emulation scene appear in a proposed injunction.

That anatomically tricky relationship is enticing by itself, but even if those retro action platformers just register as historical relics in your memory, Berserk Boy does enough that’s new and interesting that it doesn’t need to rely on aping its inspirations. My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you dislike getting stabbed in the back in first-person games, you might not like Voin. If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several months on the Steam beta build, Valve last night officially launched an update which revamps the shopping experience and lets you hide your shame. Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won't ask why you might want to hide any particular games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crema, the creators of much-liked Pokemon-like Temtem, are teasing a new untitled game set in the same universe - the mystifying Project Downbelow. It isn't Temtem: Swarm, aka Temtem Vampire Survivors, nor is it Temtem 2. But it will "try out new things we would love to see in a hypothetical Temtem 2", including a new combat system running on a "stronger" game engine. The tease accompanies news that Crema are making significant changes to Temtem as part of the game's update 1.7 - for one thing, they're getting rid of the whole microtransaction system. Temtempestuous times indeed!

        <updated>2024-03-04T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.]]></summary>
