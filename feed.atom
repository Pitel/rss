        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portal 2 was released in 2011 to widespread acclaim. Now, 22 years later, there’s a free fan-made mod called Portal: Revolution that perfectly re-captures the joy of the game, albeit with the sad omission of a much-loved character.


Released on January 6 2024, Portal: Revolution—developed by Second Face Software—has received positive reviews on Steam. Over 3,000 people have reviewed the mod at the time of this writing, and 94% of those are positive. 


One of the reviewers on Steam likened it to the scene in Ratatouille where the chef eats something made by the rat and has a flashback to a heartwarming childhood memory. They’re right, too.

The game add-on offers eight hours of exclusive gameplay, voice acting that perfectly captures the humor of the original game and challenging levels to work through. Promising to pick up in terms of difficulty where the original Portal 2 left off, there really is some challenge to work through.


Sadly, the add-on takes place after the demise of GLaDOS, so we’re without her dark sense of humor. But with so much on offer, we can’t hold that against the developers. 


As well as taking the difficulty of puzzles up a notch, the developers have also introduced some new elements to gameplay. There’s a new variant of laser cube and field that cleanses gel. Second Face Software have also resurrected a feature that was removed during development of the original Portal 2: "Pneumatic Diversity Vents."

Portal: Revolution is available now on Steam for free and you can play it as long as you have a copy of Portal 2 downloaded to your steam account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at CES, Hyperkin has revealed the next in their line of retro Xbox controllers for modern hardware. This time around they’ll be recreating the form factor of the Xbox Controller S, which was the revision of the original Xbox’s rather beefy handpiece.


The original controller that shipped with the OG Xbox was rather divisive. It was rather bulky and rather unwieldy, even if you had big hands. This was apparently due to difficulties with the manufacturer of the controller’s PCB, but most players at the time only saw a giant controller where most of the facial real estate was taken up by a humungous logo. The controller was nicknamed “The Duke” (I actually remember hearing this moniker during the console’s lifespan) and was eventually replaced by the less massive Controller S. Apparently, some people have some love for the original monstrosity since Hyperkin recreated that one first, followed by the Xbox 360's controller.


Hyperkin’s new creation, cleverly named DuchesS, is made to work with PC and Xbox Series X|S. It has modern features like a share button and a headphone jack. Perhaps most importantly, it uses Hall Effect joysticks and analog triggers. The early images shared by Hyperkin show off white and black variations. Unfortunately, there hasn’t yet been a translucent “crystal” version announced.


I don’t have a tremendous amount of nostalgia for the Controller S, but I always love seeing retro controller recreations. I’ve certainly got enough based on the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive lying around. I think if I had one wish for the controller, it would be that it could work with the OG Xbox. I always appreciate fancier controllers for old hardware.


There is no release date or price stated for the Hyperkin DuchesS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco just released a very special five-minute recap of the history of the Mishima clan, to hype us up for Tekken 8's release on January 26. And it's narrated by none other than Succession's own Brian Cox.




What's so special about Brian Cox narrating Tekken?


Any recap would be more than welcome at this point. Some Tekken fans weren't even alive when the OG Tekken came out, and the plotline gets highly convoluted sometimes, but the extra layer of awesome here is the presence of Brian Cox.


So what about it? You might think this is yet another out-of-touch promo by a Hollywood actor whose only knowledge of the game comes from the teleprompter sitting right in front of him. Half of that is likely true, as I doubt Brian Cox knows what a Korean Backdash is, but he has a surprising …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 owners are one of the few who have yet to be able to get their hands on Sam Barlow's interactive movie title, Immortality. But their wait is finally over, as Immortality splices onto PS5 on January 23.


The news came within an announcement trailer from Barlow's Half Mermaid Productions. The trailer gives a brief idea of how the game's unique "match cut" feature works and teases the project's supernatural story.




Initially released for PC and Xbox Series X|S in August 2022, Immortality was met with glowing reviews from many outlets. Destructoid's Eric Van Allen classified it as "superb" in our review. 


Immortality's story revolves around the actress Marissa Marcel and the three films she starred in but were never released. The player uses behind-the-scene footage to jump between movies, matching shots of faces or objects to jump to a similar take in a different film. The more you interact with the game's clips, the more you begin to unravel and understand the title's dark and mysterious plot.


Outside of reviews, Immortality also cleaned up during award season. The project was nominated across numerous outlets for Best Performance, Best Story, Best Game Direction, and Best Game. Manon Gage, the lead actress who portrayed Marissa Marcel, came home with hardware at the 2022 Golden Joystick Awards for Best Performer. Gage also won the 2022 New York Game Award for Best Acting in a Game.


PlayStation 5 owners should be excited to have such a unique title become part of the console's catalog when Immortality launches on PlayStation 5 on January 23. Immortality is currently playable on PC, Xbox Series X|S, mobile, and Mac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair has announced the date for the Early Access release of Palworld – the legally distinct Pokémon game with guns. It will launch on January 19. Accompanying the announcement is a new trailer.


Palworld is an open-world crafting survival game that features monsters extremely reminiscent of Nintendo’s Pokémon series. The twist is that rather than tame them through friendship, you blast them with an array of firepower. You’ll also need to do some base building to keep your Pals a place to eat and rest.




The trailer shows off some other… uh, trainers, who wield some legally distinct Pokeballs. Palworld allows for up to 32 players. PVP battles are planned but won’t be in the initial Early Access launch.


The derivative nature of Palworld’s concept sort of undermines the weirdness of it. However, I have to admit that recent looks into it have looked pretty fun. With something like this, I’d almost expect the devs to quickly spit something out to capitalize on the novelty of the concept, but that doesn’t look like what’s going on here. The developer seems to be taking their time in developing it.


On the other hand, Pocketpair doesn’t exactly have the best track record, but that’s not always the whole story. I’m at least curious enough to try it.


Palworld launches into Early Access on PC January 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It's also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

Remedy's Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game's villainous Entity.
Mind you, I'm a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight's universe, not Behaviour Interactive. "As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back," it reads. "Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key." Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation's Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019's Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We're thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!
https://t.co/BZRimbXww6
January 9, 2024
Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it's fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're just past the first week of the new year and it's all hands on deck for rivals Nvidia and AMD. With the former announcing three new RTX 4000 SUPER graphics cards, the latter was quick to unveil a boosted version of one of its current gen products.


Announced at CES 2024, AMD is launching the Radeon RX 7600 XT, a somewhat enhanced version of the 7600 that released last May. While it's admittedly at the lower end of the 7000 series, the XT variant does offer 16 GM of VRAM, double what the non-XT version has.




This sort of puts it on par with the likes of the 7800 XT and 7900 GRE, but only in terms of memory size. However, this does mean it will at least be a cheaper choice than the more enthusiast models, starting at $329.


Higher clock speeds as well


The double RAM is probably the biggest draw of the RX 7600 XT, but it offers other spec improvements as well. For example, it features boost clock speeds of up to 2755 MHz against the regular 7600's 2655 MHz.


The newer model will also have 22.57 TFLOPS. Compared to its predecessor's 21.75, it's another bit of extra juice for the XT variant.


Outside that, I wouldn't expect a huge performance difference between the two. It's also said to use a bit more power, with a TDP of 190W (versus 165W). However, what you can expect is the RX 7600 XT to be available from January 24. If you are interested in it, that is.

That's a sizeable savings and well worth considering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behaviour Interactive is keeping the Dead by Daylight crossover train chugging with DLC based on 2024’s winner of some awards, Alan Wake 2. The eponymous wordsmith will be joining the game as a survivor.


Dead by Daylight was released back in 2016, and since then, it’s been piling on the crossover content. By now, they must be running out of things to crossover with. Recently, they introduced a survivor DLC that is just Nicholas Cage. Like, just the dude with a few different jackets. Eventually, maybe we’ll just be getting various unrelated celebrities. Orson Welles, perhaps? Columbo?




But for now, Alan Wake is a pretty decent fit. The tormented writer is no stranger to horror and, when he’s not at a typewriter, spends much of his time under duress. The trailer shows how he gets tied into the slasher playground of Dead by Daylight. By writing, of course. Live by the pen, die by the pen.


If you’re not familiar, Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where up to four players take the role of the survivors trying to escape, and one person is a slasher trying to carve them up. It has previously crossed over with properties like Alien, Silent Hill, and A Nightmare on Elm Street.


Alan will first be available on Dead by Daylight's Public Test Build starting on January 10 at 11am EST. He’ll then be released for purchase on January 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various third-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game's story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory's Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It's unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-09T16:32:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Literally a few days ago, there were heavy rumors and leaks suggesting MSI was about to unveil its own Steam Deck rival. Low and behold, it turned out to be true. Say hello to "The Claw," a gaming device from the laptop manufacturer that's gunning for a slice of the handheld PC pie.


MSI announced the item at CES 2024, with an expected release date around the first quarter of this year. We've already seen that companies such as ASUS and Lenovo can take on the Steam Deck, so perhaps there is more room for another competitor.




As for what The Claw will be packing, details on the MSI website show it'll feature an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, along with an Intel Arc graphics chip. This is something of a departure, as the aforementioned alternatives (as well as the Deck) have opted for AMD architecture instead.


Get a grip!


So how does it stack up against the Steam Deck? With a brand-new Intel processor compared to the Zen 2 – which launched in 2019 – we can expect The Claw to offer something a little nipper with its more up-to-date guts.


It also boasts a 1920x1080 touchscreen and a 52Whr battery life. Compared to the Deck's 1200x800 screen and 50Whr battery, the former could have a bit of an edge over the latter.


However, with it running Windows 11, it could have a less intuitive mobile gaming operating system than SteamOS, which is specifically built to play games from a user's Steam library.


Only time will tell how it'll fare against Valve's OG offering, but it definitely looks like things are beginning to get crowded in the portable PC sphere.

You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I'd say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is ready to get 2024 rolling. The company has announced that it will host an Xbox Developer Direct on January 18.


Xbox teased several of the projects that we'll be seeing during the January 18 Developer Direct. Amongst them are Obsidian Entertainment's Avowed, MachineGames' Indiana Jones title, and Ninja Theory's Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.




The Xbox Wire shed a few more details on what to expect from the event, including our first real look at Indiana Jones. The Developer Direct will spend about 10 minutes on the project, which includes the first gameplay trailer and details on the title's setting and story.


There weren't really any details given for Hellblade 2's segment. Instead, the Xbox Wire says to expect a behind-the-scenes look at the game courtesy of Ninja Theory. We last saw the title at The Game Awards within an impressive new trailer and a release window confirmed for this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like Destiny 2 and Bungie are going through a never-ending torrent of struggles as of late, ranging in severity from downright catastrophic to mildly annoying. Somewhere closer to the annoying side of the scales falls the recent Checkmate PvP mode issues, which Bungie is now trying to alleviate.


Notably, Bungie admitted in mid-December its relatively newfangled Checkmate multiplayer mode didn't quite pan out. The community was so unhappy with it, in fact, that Bungie updated PvP to allow players to choose between Checkmate and the regular Control modes, which was a reasonably timely bandaid in its own right. Now, however, a new series of changes is coming to Checkmate, which may well be what the mode needed in the first place.

It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre's underpants. One act isn't the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur's Gate 3, which many players feel isn't a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG's first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act's "drastic" tone shift better in future releases. It's a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian's CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he's "figured out" the first act of Larian's next unannounced project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity is starting the new year with a sizeable round of layoffs. According to Reuters, the company plans to ax 25% of its workforce, about 1,800 employees. 


The layoffs are expected to be completed by March 2024 and it will affect all teams and areas of the business. The internal company memo states that this is being done as Unity "restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth." 


At present, the company cannot determine what the related costs and charges will be though "charges will primarily relate to employee transition, severance payments, and employee benefits." There has also been no word on what structural changes, though a company spokesperson confirmed that they are coming, Reuters reports. 


These layoffs come after Unity faced great controversy in 2023 following the announcement of "runtime fees" for developers. Plans for these additional fees have continued, and CEO James Whitehurst states it is expected that the impact of this business model change will have "minimal benefit in 2024 and ramp from there as customers adopt our new releases."


Last year, the gaming industry witnessed waves of layoffs striking several companies. It appears the trend is far from over, with Unity's massive layoffs bringing a bad start to the year. VR studio Archiact has also already announced layoffs in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stephanie Tyler Jones, who provided the face likeness for Mary Jane Watson in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, is speaking out about fans who have "crossed boundaries" over the character.


As she explains in an Instagram message, she appreciates the positive responses she's received over the years. However, certain fans have crossed the line, with some going so far as to call her workplace and attempt to speak to her. 


Upon hearing all the voicemails, she "immediately felt unsafe and uncomfortable." Though it should need no explaining, she highlights that while she may be the face behind a cultural icon, she is still "a human being trying to make a living just like you."


She also highlights that her skincare page isn't for Spider-Man or MJ fans. She asks fans to not cross boundaries, informs everyone that messages will not be answered, and you can expect to be blocked if she feels uncomfortable. 


It's worth noting that she had no longer been an actively auditioning actor or model before the incident. The roles she accepts are only creative outlets for herself and with friends. 


Jones joins an unfortunately long list of actors who have found themselves harassed following their gaming fame. This includes Laura Bailey who received threats towards her and her family after her performance as Abby in The Last of Us Part 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, the Resident Evil series has become famous for more than its horror elements. From Chris Redfield punching a boulder to the cheesy voice acting in the original games, these moments are iconic in their own right. But the one that older fans will know and love is the infamous "Jill sandwich" line.


Now, that has pretty much become a reality, thanks to user tombraidermods. Essentially, their mod allows you to play the original Resident Evil game as Jill, only now she's decked out to look like a giant sandwich, thus fulfilling Barry's prophecy.

It doesn't get much Jill-Sandwich-ier than this. Nothing else seems to change about the game, other than putting the STARS agent in between two slices of bread.


What? No lettuce?


Maybe this needs a little bit of explanation for those who don't get the reference. See, in the first installment of Resident Evil, Jill Valentine is almost crushed by a slow-falling ceiling. However, she's saved at the last second by her colleague Barry Burton.


Upon rescuing her from what would almost certainly be a horrifying death, Barry flippantly says that she almost became a "Jill sandwich." Much mirth is had by both the zombie-shooting agents.


Okay, maybe you had to be there. The point is, this mod turns that one, classic line into something literal. It's hard to say whether being wedged between two large slices of white makes taking on the hordes of undead cumbersome, but at least it gives the zombies something to much on that isn't Jill's brains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon's secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sounds like a right faff, though.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom can be pretty tough at times; wouldn't it be great if you could just wipe out any enemy in just one hit? Hmm... We personally enjoy the challenge, but for those out there who might want a bit of a helping hand, Gaming Reinvented has laid out a new glitch that effectively removes any challenge from combat encounters.
To accomplish the glitch, you'll need three things: a weapon (ideally one with reasonably good durability), at least one memory, and an unwilling participant in the form of a Bokoblin, Lynel, Gleeok, or whatever else you fancy murdering... you heathen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a sneaking affection for slightly jarring genre hybrids - games like the relatively recent Disintegration and the much older Battlezone 2, which smush action mechanics together with real-time strategy, or the rather more elegant Puzzle Quest, in which you roll around a parchment landscape fighting wizards using the power of match-3. New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You'll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

Whether you agree with the form or not, a live-action Zelda movie is in the works at Nintendo. What's more, it's being produced by none other than Sony Pictures. Yes, Sony. The PlayStation guys. Nintendo was the first to mention the project's existence, but now it's the time for the co-producers to drum up some hype and Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida is doing exactly that. Well, kind of.
At yesterday's Sony CES 2024 press conference, Yoshida gave a rundown of all of the film and TV projects that the company's Pictures arm is currently handling, which meant that Zelda had to get a shoutout. And a shoutout it got. Yes, according to the Sony CEO, The Legend of Zelda movie will deliver — are you ready for this? — "an amazing tale of adventure and discovery." Try to contain your surprise as you lift your jaw up from the floor.

If you're looking for another GoldenEye 007-style game to play on the Nintendo Switch, you might want to check out The spy who shot me, which arrived on the eShop last week for just $7.99 / £7.19.
It's a parody of James Bond-inspired and the "classic shooters" of the '90s. While the obvious comparison is Rare's legendary N64 title, some reviews on Steam also compare it to series like No One Lives Forever. It's been available on Valve's digital service since 2019 and has a "very positive" review rating overall.

The Claw – great name, by the way – actually looks and sounds closer to the Asus ROG Ally than Valve’s handheld, being a Windows 11-based device without any flashy hardware tricks like the Lenovo Legion Go’s detachable controllers. All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.

This is entirely because of the Angry Video Game Nerd, who I respect but isn’t always the best source since he’s primarily aimed at providing entertainment through a schtick. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has been singled out by him as one of the darkest spots in the NES library. I have to disagree.


Oh, it’s definitely awful. Don’t assume that I’m here to defend it. It’s as boring as a lecture on the history of terrycloth (did you know it dates back to before 4000 BCE?) and as tedious as chewing through a concrete brick. However, what you might not expect is that, when exami…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As soon as Final Fantasy XIV's new Pictomancer job was revealed during Tokyo Fan Festival, Eorzeans across social media immediately utilized their own artistic talents to honor the game's next magic user. No announcement would be complete without its fair share of memes, so here's a few of the finest we've found.


For those out of the loop, Pictomancer is the second job announced for FFXIV's upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Seemingly based on Final Fantasy 6's Relm Arrowny, the new footage of the game showed how the Pictomancer will use the power of art to inflict damage. So, naturally, Pictomancer garnered a plethora of memes exploring the implications of life as a full-time artist. These range from wholesome homages to Bob Ross to... decidedly less wholesome ideas.

Giant Bomb and Game Mess Mornings host Jeff Grubb claims that he's heard that "that was the one that might be coming to other platforms," (via VGC). Speaking on Game Mess Mornings earlier today (above), 8th January, the host states that this, alongside rumours of an Xbox "critically-acclaimed" title also making the jump, shows that Microsoft "is kind of trying to rejigger its strategy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The virtual reality market, while not as niche as it was years ago, is still a relatively small one. Even Sony's PlayStation VR2 launch last year seemed to come and go with little fanfare (and even less support for the platform nearly a year later). However, tech giant Apple is making its own case for VR and it's doing so with the $3,500 Vision Pro headset launching next month. 
While we've known about the headset and its, frankly, absurd price since last year, today, the company announced that preorders for it will begin on Friday, January 19, with a launch on February 2.

        <updated>2024-01-08T18:51:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been some fairly consistent rumors lately about Nvidia possibly launching a SUPER variant of some of its RTX 4000 GPUs. Well, they've now been officially confirmed, and these new graphics cards are coming soon.


According to a recent post on the Nvidia website, Ada Lovelace is getting three somewhat-souped-up new products this month. The RTX 4070 SUPER will be launching on January 17, while the 4070 Ti SUPER and 4080 SUPER will arrive on the scene come January 24 and January 31, respectively.




You can check also out Nvidia's CES Special Address above, which went live recently. As well as a discussion on the future of AI technology, we get a flashy trailer for the upcoming graphics cards.


How do they stack up, though?


As always when it comes to hardware, Team Green wants to sell you on the idea of these SUPER variants being better than their non-SUPER counterparts. The post linked above promises the 4070 SUPER will have faster speeds than the RTX 3090, the most powerful GPU of the previous generation.


There are also a number of charts showing how well the newer models go up against previous Nvidia hardware. It stands to reason that these soon-to-be-launched 4000 cards will be much better than the 3000 or 2000 series. The tech giant also promises a boost on their non-SUPER cousins, so it'll be really interesting to see how the RTX 4080 SUPER compares to the regular 4080, for example.


As for pricing, the 4080 SUPER will be starting at $999, the 4070 Ti SUPER will be priced from $799, while the 4070 SUPER will start at $599. So that's something to think about if you're in the market for a new graphics card.

As spotted by PCGamer, a modder is taking the 2000 Deus Ex title and putting it through an Unreal Engine 5 filter. That is to say, the quarter of a century old game is being given a bit of a boost, and it's all possible thanks to a toolkit called DXU24.




The software is a fan-made project that aims to convert older releases (in this case, games that run on Unreal Engine 1) into ones that run through UE5. The above video shows how far things have come, with the modder expecting to implement VR into Deus Ex as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep your pants on (for now); the free Cult of the Lamb: Sins of the Flesh update will be released on January 16.


The team at Massive Monster has been teasing the Sins of the Flesh update for a while now. It’s going to be the biggest update the game has seen so far, but most importantly: sex. As the name implies, when two followers get entangled, they might “find an egg,” if you know what I mean. It can then be hatched and be indoctrinated from birth to be a loyal follower of your cult.




Also coming in the update will be a new progression system to add more depth to managing your cult. There will be more rituals and buildings, as well as additional doctrines. You will also be able to level up to make chores faster. They’ve also added an “inner circle of disciples.” Let’s be honest; if you’re like me, you basically already have an inner circle of your favorite followers. You can even dress them up fancy with the tailor building, allowing you to get creative with your cult-wear.


In terms of unleashing your wrath, the update will also introduce a blunderbuss as a weapon. It’s a gun! It lets you cause carnage at close corners, or you can also snipe enemies from longer ranges.


Cult of the Lamb is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Sins of the Flesh update will release on January 16, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Square Enix revealed new information about Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV’s upcoming fifth expansion, during a fan event for the popular MMO. In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:


A new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.


Lastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. 


Last year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer. For more info, check out this primer breaking down everything you need to know about the expansion.]]></summary>

Despite his wholesome outward appearance, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto has often been known for his strict nature within the business. Interviews with the auteur have revealed him to be a surprisingly reserved individual; one who rarely gives praise to his peers.
In a recent public chat between Miyamoto and Mother creator Shigesato Itoi, translated by Daniel Sigler, Itoi relayed a story in which he was reduced to tears after he pitched the game to Miyamoto. According to Itoi, he had expected Miyamoto to be enthusiastic about his idea but was instead met with a wholly different reaction:

Though this wasn't meant to be, the developer is now finally in control of the game, with good news for its immediate future.


Notably, the controversy over the rights to The Sinking City has only come to a close very recently, with Frogwares regaining full publishing rights to the game almost five years after it first came out. To celebrate the occasion, fans can expect an all-new version of the game that integrates all the existing DLC, patches out bugs, and smooths out its performance. The new version of The Sinking City will be free for all owners of the game, and those who aren't keen on losing their saves will have the…]]></summary>

More specifically, Playground Games held a poll among Forza Horizon 5 players a few months back, allowing them to vote on which timed exclusive vehicles ought to return in early 2024. With the votes counted and accounted for, Playground has now announced the full suite of returning exotics, such as the highly coveted Porsche 911 Reimagined by Singer from 1990. There's a grand total of 10 returning vehicles, as well as 8 new Community Choice cars, giving players lots to grind for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 14,000 titles were released on Steam in 2023. To say that it's the top dog of the digital PC gaming world would be wholly accurate. Part of the reason it remains as popular as ever is all the sale events that occur, and the first one of this year is going live soon.


The Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest officially kicks off later on today. If you head to the website now, you can see what's likely to be featured. Everything from Brewpub Simulator to Cities Skylines to Planet Zoo is going to be part of the event.




The above trailer shows what else you can expect, whether you want discounts on Monopoly, Railway Empire, or Cartel Tycoon. Basically, if it's a game that's about earning or managing money, then it's probably going to be in this fest.


Become the capitalist you always dreamed of being!


If you're into all that – making big bucks or taking part in simulated industries – then this Steam event will likely appeal to you.


Personally, it's a genre I've never been too good at. From my early days of playing PC games when I could barely make ends meet in SimCity or Theme Hospital, I've never been particularly amazing at becoming a financial success in economy-style games. A bit like real life, now that I think about it. Sigh.


Anyway, the Steam Economy and Capitalist Fest starts at 10AM PT and goes on until next Monday. What better way to kick-start 2024 than by becoming a wealthy industrialist after, possibly, an expensive Christmas period?

In a recent post on Steam, Facepunch Studios celebrated Rust passing its first-decade milestone. That's if you include the early access release – which the developer obviously does – as that came out in December 2013. The full version didn't officially drop until 2018.




As for what's occurred in that time, well the studio says that Rust has sold more than 16,000,000 copies in total. That's an astonishing achievement for an indie outfit and is just under half what Zelda: Breath of the Wild …]]></summary>

To celebrate 2024, the developer Digital Extremes has announced Warframe's latest set of Void Corruption Alerts, giving players a chance to earn unique mods and bundles of credits.


Void Corruption Alerts aren't a new thing in Warframe, of course. While veteran players may find the content added as part of the recent Whispers in the Walls update more interesting, 2024's first batch of Void Corruption Alerts is still very important both for newcomers and for those who haven't yet filled out their Mod libraries. With Fleeting Expertise, Blind Rage, Transient Fortitude, and a slew of others on offer, now's the time to jump in and earn those mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though much of PlayStation's success has come from its stable of first-party games, it has also benefitted from third-party titles that receive Sony's support. In an interview with Boardroom, Shawne Benson, who is the global head of third-party portfolio and acquisitions, shed some light on how some of these deals come about. 


A typical workday will include meetings with prospective partners. During these meetings, it's not just the quality of the games that's considered. The team also has to ask whether the titles resonate with the PlayStation brand and appeal to its audience. 


By the end of it, if a partnership is established, "it doesn’t always end with a traditional deal." Some partners are disappointed by this because they think it means that the game isn't good. However, that's n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knight club.
Atooi's Knights of the Rogue Dungeon follows closely in the footsteps of Q*Bert, the popular isometric platformer from the golden days of the arcade. The goal of each randomly selected level is to simply hop onto every single tile (changing its color) while avoiding any of the roaming enemies that randomly drop onto the stage as you explore.
Though you can choose to tackle each stage any way you’d like, you’re incentivized to plan out a route where you touch the same tiles as few times as possible. Not only does your score multiplier increase if you can continuously land on fresh tiles, but after hitting a set threshold, you’ll activate 'Knight Power' which enables you to turn the tables and instantly kill any foes you touch. However, both the score multipliers and Knight Power will disappear if you step on a tile you’ve already touched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.
The usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.

Hey, we've all been there, right? Okay, not while presenting an award at the Golden Globes, but maybe in line at a Starbucks.

Some new game releases we are tip-toeing towards with our shields raised this week, in case they turn out to be Mimics: Allison Road-inspired horror Supernormal (8th Jan), free turn-based dungeon crawler Buriedbornes2 (10th Jan), medical management sim War Hospital (11th Jan), feudal Chinese spin-off Reigns: Three Kingdoms (11th Jan), pleasingly nonsensically-named retro RPG Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk (13th Jan).

Chief among those wins are two in acting: Outstanding Guest Actor and Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) won for his role as Bill in “Long, Long Time”, beating out his on-screen boyfriend Frank, played by Murray Bartlett (The White Lotus).

        <updated>2024-01-07T15:07:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After hitting Early Access back in June 2021, we finally have a date for the initial launch of Phantom Abyss. The trap-dodging asynchronous multiplayer game is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Humble Store on January 25. 


Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Team WIBY let the latest announcement loose on Steam. You can see some lightning-fast snippets of Version 1.0 in action in the launch date trailer below.




For those just now seeing what Team WIBY has been working on, Phantom Abyss tosses players into procedurally generated temples with the straightforward but challenging task of retrieving sacred relics. As anyone who has ever traversed even the most modest of temples will tell you, that's just askin' for booby traps. From perilous chasms to temple guards, you only get one chance to survive and make your way through each temple, so you have to choose your relic path wisely. 


The asynchronous multiplayer comes into play as you explore the temples and spot the phantoms of fallen players who have come and gone in that temple before. You can observe the actions and deadly missteps of up to 20 phantoms — including Steam friends and total strangers — and try not to repeat the same mistakes. 


Fortune and glory


It's been a while since we checked the game out for ourselves, and a lot can happen in over two years of Early Access. 


Among the updates to look for as we venture into 1.0 are a completely overhauled Adventure Mode, a new Abyss Mode, and changes to Whips. The Abyss Mode was previously known as Classic Mode and acts as the heart of the game, letting players roll the dice to make their way through all four areas of a unique temple to collect the relic waiting at the end. 


We can all look forward to failing miserably at it together later this month.

Pokud jste žádný vychytaný dárek nedostali, nebojte. Sice se toho za poslední měsíc se mnoho zajímavého neudálo, nicméně tentokrát zajímavost připravených témat nejspíše předčí jejich kvantitu. Proběhla totiž konference 37C3, na které došlo na prezentaci výsledků analýzy a hackování polských vlaků, které výrobce záměrně na dálku vyřazoval z provozu. Dále pak rušení GPS v poslední době, taktéž v Polsku. Vyšly zajímavé videoprohlídky fabrik firem Průša a ASML. Siglent chystá nové řady 12 osciloskopů jako odpověď na Rigol a O2 zavádí v Česku IoT síť Cat-M.

Ze světa HW mohou strahováci ukázat průsvitný procesor nebo jak se může vymstít snaha používat power planes v Altiu místo polygonů, zatímco ze světa SW novou verzi nástroje pro reverzní inženýrství Ghidra nebo to, že iPhony by už nemělo jít shodit pomocí Flipper Zero.


Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 9. ledna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having marked its 10 year anniversary last year, survival shooter Rust is seeing in its second decade by adding the long-awaited ability to boost your inventory with a backpack. The update will continue what developers Facepunch Studios say will be even more updates and improvements throughout 2024, even as other long-requested additions slide back to 2025 or later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven't played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur's Gate 3 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn't anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I'd finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. 
What did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of 'em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn't even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I'm pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I'm allergic to anything over four hours - and I don't like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We're curious to see how the series follows up Season 1's dramatic conclusion. Season 2's cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past Christmas marked the anniversary of me playing Overwatch 2. 7 years of my partner and I swearing at seemingly impenetrable enemy teams, then whooping in victory when we finally pull together a plan that cracks them apart - or just as our chill W+M1 game while we chat about our days.
For the uninitiated, Overwatch is a bright, colorful, and very funny team v team FPS that ditches the dour gunmen for a cast that doesn’t all require raw aim skill. Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there's never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first week of January is always one of my favourite times of the year. It's a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I'll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year's resolutions. Traditionally, I don't often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I'm aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more 'nice to haves' rather than 'musts', I'd say. 
This year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you've also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco.

Happily, I was wrong: it did fine. Happilyer still, Mind Over Magic is here (though in early access) to provide a somewhat more traditional design, and it's already compelling enough to turn my quick test into a seven hour delve.

I knew it would be the case, but I left the cinema and said to my mate, "I don't really know what just happened but what happened was great". It was a lot of things! A visual feast. Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.
Since then, we've listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It's all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning. Much like Souls, Ghibli's latest only expands as you reflect on it.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the "opening movie," which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called "Full Moon Full Life." 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: 


For more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes. After that, watch the newest episode of The Game Informer Show to find out why Persona 3 Reload is one of our most anticipated games of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima's new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is "also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media" and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.
I doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

While those servers allowed caped crusaders to continue roleplaying, the caveat was that they could be shut down at any moment by the most dastardly supervillains of all: lawyers.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes' IP owners NCSoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, there was the Xbox Series X mini-fridge, and now the Series S gets its own appliance in the form of a toaster. Bread will never be the same again. 
Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. 
Those interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy was one of 2021's biggest surprises, succeeding where Square Enix's Avengers game failed by finding an identity beyond its movie counterpart thanks to strong writing. Alas, it didn't meet Square Enix's sales expectations.

Now it's free via the Epic Games Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian Roulette is just an edgy version of Snakes & Ladders. It's pure luck gussied up with high stakes and the cool aesthetic of spinning a six-shooter. A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people's teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That's Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year, folks! Have you recovered from the all the 100+ hour RPGs that came out last year? Well, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official "big'uns" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.

The idea is less to take advantage of UE5's various whizbangs and bellwhistles, like the new Nanite geometry system, than to grease the launch chutes for future Everspace 2 updates and expansions.

From what I can tell, Infinite Wealth is as much a Pokémon trainers paradise as it is a game about the Japanese criminal underworld. I'm sold.

Right as it dropped, I was in New York giving the Animal Crossing-esque minigame a go myself, albeit for a quickfire half hour of bashing rubbish bags with a baseball bat and plonking a urinal on the dirt to satisfy a tutorial. Still, in that brief time I've come away thinking I could lose much of my life to the promise of converting a polluted island into an idyll with the power of abs and friendship. There is the strong possibility of a grind. But hey, it's optional!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the "hypertapping" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and "rolling," discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

She was a dame with hair red as communion wine spilled by a bishop looking at a nun's cleava- oh what, wait, she's how old? Christ, Philip, get your head out of the gutter for once, this is a family website. I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I'm as disappointed as you.

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.
Speaking to the Polish outlet Parkiet, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”

Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth's past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar.

And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games.

Last year I complained about Puzzmo's crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true!

So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black has joined the cast of the in-development live-action Minecraft movie. Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic "Peaches," too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Black himself even nodded to the news in an Instagram post that showed him reading a Minecraft Basics for Dummies book. However, neither he nor the fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I greet news of the completion of a Unity remaster for The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall with equal parts excitement and horror. Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I'm getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

        <updated>2024-01-02T22:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term "late" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, "the timing was incorrect and has since been amended." So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, "And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year."
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won't be compatible with old save files.

This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

Announced via a Disney Parks blog post of all things, Star Wars Outlaws ranks as the No.22 most "Ooooh-Worthy Thing" out of the 2024 Disney Experiences line-up - which, considering the list only stretches to 24 entries is a bit of an unfair burn on the game, if you ask me, especially when No.21 is... *checks notes* new Disney Eats and Stitch clothes collections.

The Mexica journey to central Mexico; Moses leading the Jewish people across the desert; the founding of Rome – as told by Virgil – by those that fled the fall of Troy. Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration. On August 8, 2013, game designer Lucas Pope, the man behind the studio 3909, released Papers, Please, a game about managing migration.
Papers, Please, subtitled “A Dystopian Document Thriller,” was for some the first time they played a game whose core design ethos challenged their worldviews and understanding. Other games have placed the topic of migration front and center. Path Out (Causa Creations, 2014), an adventure game that retells the journe…]]></summary>

It's Makoto Wakaido's Case Files Trilogy Deluxe - a collection of not three, but four detective stories in which you go about solving grizzly murders across different towns and villages in Japan. In short: if you like the investigation bits of Ace Attorney and need something to whet your appetite before the Apollo Justice Trilogy comes out on January 25th, this will be 100% up your street.

The topline: they want to do more with generative "AI" machine learning tools,  and they're still dead keen on metaversy VR/AR stuff. The blockchain remains a "focus", too, though it gets much less of a billing than in 2023's new year letter from Square Enix’s previous president Yosuke Matsuda.

We've got Amber and Yellow warnings in London - I do not understand what these terms mean, but I'm going to add a Sapphire warning for escalating Maw activity. The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.
Some new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you're talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth's depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it's sure to make it so …]]></summary>

There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.

One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. 
The deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's saying 2023 has been a stonking year for video games. To be honest dear reader, I don't think it's been my year. That might be because I've not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there's only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.
One of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.

If all were just and right in the world, then it wouldn't have left out the following list of excellent games that came out this year! Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don't have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.
Anyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you'll find four of my honourable mentions for games I've enjoyed playing the most this year. If you have a hole in your Steam library, maybe these will help fill it over the Christmas break!

Probably something like 70% of my 2023 games time was spent on precisely two co-op shooters, neither of which I’ve written about much, nor were new enough to be eligible for the most recent Advent Calendar. I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.
Still, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And thus, we arrive at the end of another year. A year filled with some very excellent games, and some very not excellent games. And through it all, the RPS guides team has been quietly toiling away, appeasing The Beast That Is Google with medium-rare slabs of SEO meat, and providing the answers to oft-asked gaming questions.
It's important to me to have a moment in the year where we can step into the light for a little bit and celebrate everything the guides team has accomplished this year. Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.
2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let's take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You've never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the year almost behind us, it's hard not to look back at 2023 with conflicted feelings. It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development. Here are the 10 biggest gaming news…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've mentioned elsewhere that I played a lot of huge games this year, both literally referring to their size, and metaphorically referring to their brand name awareness (I had great intentions of doing a long-running Starfield diary, where I visited every planet I could until I got demoralised by the project, but unfortunately that turned out to be the length of one entry). I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.
So I thought I'd struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box. And yet I didn't! They're also very on brand. Words and murder you say? Maybe in 2024 I should make a resolution to switch things up a bit. Gotta keep you guessing, dear readers...

Today, six years later, Microsoft owns more than 50 studios, thanks to various acquisitions over the years.
Microsoft announced in January of 2022 that it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, the largest video game acquisition ever. After nearly two years of Stateside court cases with the federal government, appeals and appeasements across the pond, unprecedented document leaks, direct arguments from rivals like PlayStation, and more, the deal is complete: Xbox is home to all 19 of Activision Blizzard’s studios (and King’s 11 mobile game development st…]]></summary>

This is different from the Steam Awards, voting for which is ongoing, and instead is built from Steam data like revenue, peak concurrent players, and so on.

The 2020 update, Persona 5 Royal, is the best-received successor, but both 2021 Musou hybrid Persona 5 Strikers and the recently released turn-based strategy RPG Persona 5 Tactica gave players plenty to love.
Among the reasons players love those games are the new additions to the cast. Each of those aforementioned titles gives the core Phantom Thieves new characters with whom to interact. Royal gave us Kasumi and Maruki, Strikers gave us Sophia and Zenkichi, and most recently, Tactica gave us Erina and Toshiro.

Obsidian's Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an "embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power". Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.

The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month's selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio's 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, "Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic." You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, "Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish."D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.
Are you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

By the end of his journey through Silent Hill, everything will be chaos – his mind and even the world around him, a violent cacophony of anguish.
But in the beginning, it’s silent. The kind of quiet that’s deafening, where you hear your pulse in your ears, and every tiny sound becomes the worst thing you can imagine.
Includes spoilers for Silent Hill 2
The opening hour of Silent Hill 2 is – without question – the scariest thing I have ever played. Which, taken at face value, might seem a bit ridiculous. Your goal is simply to navigate James through a dilapidated apartment building. At most, you’ll face 10 enemies throughout the building’s three floors, but they hardly pose a threat; they’re easily avoided or killed. Gameplay primarily consists…]]></summary>

The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It's a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.
