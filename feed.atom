        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homeworld 3, threequel to the OG melancholy spaceship strategy series, has been delayed into the first half of next year. The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

We saw games about frogs, cats, bears, witches, and mail delivery — but which of them are coming to Switch, you ask?

I mentioned Planet Of Lana earlier this week in my Day Of The Devs 2022 round-up, because it featured in that indie showcase too. Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it’s quite charming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn't exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I've not got much to point you towards - there's no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

If you've seen Palworld's previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show.

Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream "You blew it up, damn you!" when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he's been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 25th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's anything I've learned from today's Future Of Play event, it's that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it's at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an "Indigenous cybernoir detective game" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe "in the works" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with "crime, conflict, and propaganda". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

Are you a fan of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow? Are you a fan of Blasphemous? If you answered "yes" to both of those questions (heck, even just one), then you'll definitely want to keep an eye out for The Last Faith, a Souls-like Metroidvania (or 'soulsvania', according to the publisher) making its way to Switch later in 2022.
From developer Kumi Souls Games, The Last Faith showcases gorgeous pixelated visuals along with challenging gameplay in a clear homage to Konami's seminal Castlevania series. You'll be navigating winding paths filled with deadly beasts before finding yourself toe-to-toe against huge boss creatures that will demand you make the most of your varied weaponry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2017's Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.


Unlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino's body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can't let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners' street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.
If you're ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.
As Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.
Beyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.
Beyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.
As Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.
Arctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.]]></summary>

It's also seemingly a game where you're a wee smout and can ride on the back of a friendly hedgehog. There's a new trailer which covers both of these elements below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I adore Deadly Premonition, a game which shines despite substantial elements being janky or bad. The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not "so bad it's good", it's so good it doesn't matter that it's bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I've been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I'm sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I've given up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most intriguing new announcements at today's Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

        <updated>2022-06-11T19:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.
The studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.
The studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.
Based on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.
The footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.
Dimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.
Bramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it's shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.
The Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it's strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.
Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.
We don't have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Sunday Gold is a "classic adventure" game from developer BKOM Studios and publisher Team17. The point-and-click, turn-based title has serious Disco Elysium vibes, though its dystopian future London looks to be a little more over-the-top. The game's leading characters, a group of scrappy criminals, are on a mission to reveal the truth behind the unethical business practices of corrupt billionaire, Keny Hogan. And today's trailer showed the bombastic length's they're ready to go to achieve that goal. Check out the world premiere trailer below.


Fully voiced and filled with puzzles alongside the combat, Sunday Gold is set to launch on PC later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turbo Golf Racing turned heads when it was revealed in March thanks to its blend of golf with Rocket League-style racing. During today’s Future Game Show, we found out that the wacky sports game is coming this August. Can’t wait? Don’t despair; you can play the game in its second beta right now. 
For the unfamiliar, the game pits up to eight players against each other as they race giant golf balls down obstacle-filled courses to knock them into the finish cup. Vehicles can jump and glide, and collecting power-ups lets players hit the ball further, and perform ground stomps, among other abilities. 


Developer Secret Mode announced that Turbo Golf Racing launches on Xbox consoles and PC on August 4. Beginning today, Beta 2 kicks off on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. This larger test features 12 courses, eight-player online multiplayer (with crossplay), single-player time trials, and improvements based on feedback from Beta 1. Leveling up during Beta 2 unlocks exclusive cosmetic wheels, an avatar, and a spoiler for the final game. Beta 2 concludes on June 20. 
Turbo Golf Racing arrives to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on August 4 and will be available on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entropy Centre, a sci-fi first-person puzzle adventure game, was just showcased during today’s Future Games Show conference, and it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this year. 
The gameplay trailer did not reveal a release date, but with only half a year left, you at least know you’ll be waiting no more than roughly six months for it. That’s great because The Entropy Centre looks like an intriguing and fun puzzle game. A new British indie studio called Stubby Games is developing it, and Playstack is publishing the title. It is built around a puzzle mechanic that “allows players to think in reverse and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles,” such as the game’s main obstacle: reversing time far enough back to stop Earth from imploding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard not to view Kitfox Games as the stars of tonight's Future Of Play event. Hot on the heels of the news that Boyfriend Dungeon will be receiving a substantial free update, they unveiled Mossfield Origins, the next game coming courtesy of their publishing arm.
Developed by Studio Any Percent, Mossfield Origins promises an extremely relaxing take on the sci-fi city builder genre. The announcement trailer, which you can check out below, opens with a serene disembodied voice setting the tone for what's to come. "We were sent here with a purpose," the voice murmurs soothingly, then adds: "But we're not doing that any more."

        <updated>2022-06-11T19:07:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced last year with a short trailer, Luto made an appearance as part of the Future Games Show presentation. This first-person horror experience is bound to scare the pants off of somebody, especially with its impressive cloth rendering, making a particular terror in the new footage a sight to behold.


Developer Broken Bird Games is looking to create an immersive and emotional experience with Luto. Players take control of a character attempting to escape from their house, but trying to do just that will take you to some wild and spooky places. The new footage is full of atmospheric locales, such as dilapidated rooms filled with mysterious chains, dark hallways populated by sheet-covered individuals, and a hollowed-out cave system. Much of the lighting and materials presented in the footage look great, especially the sheet physics and rendering of an entity that breaks into a hallway and rises to its feet in an unsettling way.
Luto is set to launch on PlayStation and PC in 2022.]]></summary>

Boyfriend Dungeon: Secret Weapons

Well, we're finally getting a look at it. The new trailer introduced us to Hammer Laleh, who has a special ability called "the death spiral."

This year's Wholesome Direct just wrapped up, and like always, it made good on its promise of filling our hearts and minds with edgeless, universally appealing fun. Most of the games at the show might look niche to those whose definition of "an average and normal videogame" is a AAA shooter, but for the majority of people in the world (most of whom have never played The Last of Us or Halo in their lives), stuff like skateboarding birds wearing funny hats is a lot more inviting.
That's probably why, despite middling initial reviews and a lack of big publisher support, SkateBIRD is "on the cusp of making a million bucks" in profit. It's fun too! A few patches after launch, the game plays better than ever, and if you still find any of the controls to be frustrating, most of them can be adjusted in accessibility settings. Those options, plus the universal appeal of becoming a double-jumping swallow who can freestyle (and fumble) across a series of duct-taped skate parks, have done a lot to help the game make numbers.
Some of those dollars have been spent on making the game even better. Announced at the Wholesome Direct, the game will be getting an update today that adds a new pool-themed park, a playable crewmate from Among Us, and new Pride-themed outfits, though SkateBIRD creator Megan Fox tells us she "...just wanted gay clothes anyways and I'd added them a while ago, and then it accidentally lined up..." with both the month-long LGBTQ+ celebration and its coinciding Wholesome Direct.
This content is headed to SkateBIRD on consoles as well, so if you want to whip out your Switch and kickflip with an owl while wearing rainbow beenie, you won't have to wait long.

And thus was the utterly bizarre tagline with which the fledgling Namco corporation advertised its brand new space-age release, Motos. And if you too want to flip mysterious space bee, you can, as retro publisher Hamster has now added the forgotten title to its mammoth Arcade Archives on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released in arcades in 1985, before later finding its way to the home computer market, Motos is a very early entry in the car battler genre and sees vehicular carnage located against the backdrop of a bizarre platform floating adrift in outer space. The player pilots the titular "Moto" and is tasked with running each of their opponents off of the stage, while avoiding taking a tumble into the void themselves.
A whopping 62 stages of bumper-to-bumper action awaits, featuring increasingly nasty hordes of enemies, as well as vehicle upgrades such as the momentum-boosting "Power Bumps" and even "Jump Parts", which afford our Moto the ability to leap through the air, Knight Rider-style. You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber spaceharrier80. Be sure to check out the game's cute beep-boop score, powered by Namco's formative Super Pac-Man hardware.
Motos is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Survival horror fans are getting another game to watch for, just in time for Halloween. Signalis is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 27, 2022.
The news shown today as part of the Guerrilla Collective stream also had some new gameplay of rose-engine's low-poly survival horror game. In a press release, publisher Humble Games confirms Signalis will be a day-one Xbox Game Pass game when it arrives in October. There's a demo arriving as part of Steam Next Fest, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1okoqNHFlXc
Signalis follows Elster, a Replika trying to solve a dark and terrifying mystery. Along the way, she encounters nightmarish monsters and has to struggle to survive, while discovering her own lost dreams.
Cosmic horror
It's got some definite cosmic horror vibes, mixed with tech and sci-fi themes around seemingly artificial life. It all feels very space horror, which granted, there's been a decent amount of in the summer showcases so far.
What struck me about Signalis when I demoed it for last year's Tribeca Games showcase was not just the aesthetic, though. (Granted, the aesthetic is fantastic.)
It's got some classic Resident Evil feel to it, with isometric viewpoints and carefully placing shots in slowly approaching monsters. It had a real "every bullet counts" approach that I dug. And the puzzle segments that dove into first-person kept things moving between the survival horror sections.
Rose-engine's space-based scare fest has been one of my most-anticipated indies for this year, and that hasn't changed yet. I'm looking forward to seeing the cosmic mysteries and horrors collide later this year.
Signalis will launch for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 27, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerilla Collective's Summer Game Fest-adjacent live stream revealed a slew of new and upcoming indie games. But among the Braid-like puzzle platformers and narrative adventures were several horror games worth keeping an eye on. Here's what stood out to us. 


The Fridge is Red
Easily the highlight of today's stream, The Fridge is Red looks like what you might find if you went video game shopping in Hell.

Since the official gameplay reveal of Capcom's Street Fighter 6 at last week's Sony State of Play presentation, there has been an almost tidal wave of news, updates, and tidbits, (both officially and very unofficially), regarding this latest bout of World Warriorism. This weekend, lucky folks over at the Summer Game Fest Play Days event in L.A. are getting some time with an early build of the new sequel, coming away with positive opinions and a fistful of interesting and intriguing hands-on updates.
Street Fighter 6 is a long way from launch, and as such all of the following info is both based on limited hearsay and is subject to change between now and release day.

While we wait for the next entry in the Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive Games is dishing out even more choice-based horror in its familiar cinematic style. And this time, it's the big one — the moment fans have been waiting for since Until Dawn. From the outset, The Quarry tries to recapture that lightning in a bottle in terms of scope, story, and execution, and this supernatural end-of-summer-camp adventure hits the mark.
Evil is afoot, and your decisions will once again dictate who makes it to sunrise.

The Quarry is a standalone new IP — it doesn't belong to Bandai Namco's Dark Pictures series — but there are so many shared traits. And the refinements are stacking up.

I hope that you've enjoyed the festivities thus far. Please join us here at Destructoid for the coming week's news and streams. As good boy Occams has told me time and again, it's you, the community, and your feedback to the tidal wave of news that really makes this season fun and engaging.

Well folks, it's been another jam-packed week at Nintendo Life, with plenty of highlights to mention! First up, the excellent Mario Strikers: Battle League launched on Friday and we thought it was a great sports game for the Switch in our review. Similarly, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords launched digitally on the eShop, but Limited Run Games confirmed a physical release of the game later this year, along with a boat load of other announcements.
Elsewhere, we got our first glimpse at the long-awaited Flashback 2 at the Summer Game Fest live stream, bringing an end to an agonising 30-year wait. We also got a release date for TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, and it's a lot closer than you might expect! Finally, in a bittersweet story, the folks over on Twitter rallied together to help a young cancer patient connect with The Pokémon Company.

In 2002, Randy Linden - a veteran programmer known for the "impossible" SNES port of DOOM and the creator of the BLEEM emulator - was working on a Quake prototype for GBA. The video game archivists at Forest of Illusion have now been supplied with a working ROM of Linden's prototype:

Join Game Informer as we chat with Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR, about the exciting DLC, the new bosses players will be facing, and what the developers are planning on for the future.


Alex Stadnik is here to ask the burning questions fans might have. The two start things off by discussing what the team brought to Summer Game Fest and chat about the ins and outs of the Mortimer Freeze boss fight. They then discuss what players can expect from the five major fights found in The Delicious Last Course and how the stages change the experience from the main game.
They then move to Ms. Chalice, the new character that isn't a carbon copy of the title's namesake or Mugman. One of the main additions of the DLC streamlines the experience with a new moveset and abilities but is far from an easy mode. Players will have to sacrifice some of the buffs they were used to in the main game in order to use her as she's activated as a charm.
The two also discuss how Studio MDHR developed the game through COVID, how the soundtrack is yet again a highlight, and whether or not players can expect new secrets when they boot up the DLC on June 30. Finally, Stadnik and Maja round out the interview and briefly discuss what's next for the studio.
If you enjoyed this look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, be sure to check out our recent preview impressions, our talk about the DLC on this week's GI Show, and our fresh episode of New Gameplay Today showing off the Mortimer Freeze boss fight! Thanks, as always, for watching!]]></summary>

Capcom's reveal of Street Fighter 6 at the conclusion of this year's Pro Tour set the table for the next entry in perhaps the most beloved fighting franchise of all time. Following meager offerings at launch, Street Fighter V, which launched in 2016, rebounded to give fans a ton of features, fighters, and content by the end of its lifecycle. Street Fighter 6 hopes to avoid those initial stumbles by including various modes of play from the get go, but my hands-on time during Summer Game Fest 2022's Play Days in Los Angeles, California was all about seeing how matches play out.

Even to those who don't regularly play video games, their music is iconic, and in many cases instantly recognizable. There are a ton of different factors that can make a game stand out as one of the greats, and a great soundtrack alone is enough to make a title stick in our heads for years to come. The Grammys are the most prestigious awards in music, and now they're finally giving video game music the credit that it's due.
The Recording Academy actually added five new categories that will be honored at the awards ceremony next year, including "Songwriter of the Year," "Best Spoken Word Poetry Album," "Alternative Music Performance," "Americana Music Performance," and of course, "Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Interactive Media."
[caption id="attachment_329238" align="alignnone" width="1280"] [Image Source: Nintendo Life][/caption]While this will be the first time that video game music will be honored in its own category, this is not the first time that score from a game has won a Grammy.
Most recently, The 8-Bit Band took home "Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Capella" for their cover of Kirby Super Star's "Meta Knight's Revenge" earlier this year. Civilization IV composer Christopher Tin won the "Best Instrumental Arrangement with a Vocalist" award for the track "Baba Yetu" in 2010. Journey composer Austin Wintory was nominated for the "Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media" award, but unfortunately didn't take home the win.
Hopefully now that games have an entire category of their own, the incredible work that game composers do will be recognized on a larger scale. Game composers have a whole new set of challenges to face when writing for interactive media, which, in my eyes at least, is really what makes it stand out from other types of scores.
Video games will always have awards for music within the industry, but taking home a Grammy award just hits different, I imagine.

Elden Ring is getting a pair of official physical guide books later this year from Future Press, and by the time you get your hands on them, you might have forgotten enough to actually need them again. Joking! Kind of. I feel like this has to be 2022's most wiki'd game, right?
Future Press is planning to release its "biggest project yet" — two hardcover volumes known as the Elden Ring Books of Knowledge — and they'll cost $49.99 each. Volume I will be available this summer, and Volume II will be arriving in the fall.
In terms of a content breakdown, these are meant to be the exhaustive, definitive resource books for all things Elden Ring, so lots of stats, pictures, and insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They're really doing it
Video game adaptations continue to be all the rage, and now Duke Nukem gets to join in. The movie rights to Duke Nukem have been acquired by Legendary Entertainment.
The Hollywood Reporter reports that Legendary has quite an interesting crew on board to produce the Duke Nukem project, too. Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg are reportedly on board.
Alongside Legendary Entertainment, Marla Studios will also be on to produce. Marla Studios was founded by Assassin's Creed (the movie) producer Jean-Julien Baronnet and specializes in video game adaptations. THR reports the search for a writer is underway, and there's no director attached just yet either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZahQltQK5xQ
There was a Duke Nukem film project in the works not too long ago, over at Paramount. The project even had wrestling superstar John Cena attached to it, but the film reportedly stalled out.
The Duke is back?
By all accounts, this is some wild news. Duke Nukem may have been a heavy-hitter of the arena shooter era, but the series has stalled out. The infamously catastrophic Duke Nukem Forever seemed like it had forever shut the lid on new Duke Nukem games.
But not all video game heroes of the '90s have faded into obscurity. Lara Croft had her revival in both video game and movie form, and Serious Sam has kept trucking along. 2016's Doom was a brilliant revitalization, but it also made Doomguy a household name again.
Does Duke Nukem still have that appeal? Either way, Legendary Entertainment is picking the right team. The Cobra Kai is pretty dang good, and I'd imagine those showrunners could do something interesting with Duke. To be honest, after re-visiting the old Cena news, I'm now picturing a Peacemaker-style take on Duke Nukem and thinking it could somehow work.

It's almost time for beat-em-up sequel River City Saga: Three Kingdoms on the Nintendo Switch! Unless you're in Japan, that is, because the game is already out over there. But for us in the West, the Nintendo Switch release date is July 21st, 2022 — and it's looking rather lovely.
The game is based on the Three Kingdoms of 3rd century China, and appears to be split between three playable factions. You might recognise the Three Kingdoms from games like Dynasty Warriors, or even the recently-announced Reigns: Three Kingdoms.

To this day, I don't think I ever ended up finishing Maneater, but I'd still recommend it to anyone wanting a silly arcadey action diversion with RPG progression to keep you going. It's been out for two years, and if you never got around to it, today's your day to grab Maneater for free from the Epic Games Store. The PC copy is up for grabs until June 16.
The game lets you conquer your oceanic fears — instead of a helpless human, you play the power-hungry shark who's out for (well-justified!) revenge. Of course, you'll start off as a weakling in the shallows before bulking up enough to face your fisherman rival as the apex predator. The game has a satirical story for those who need some rising stakes.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/downwell-creator-poinpy-new-netflix-game-about-going-up/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=downwell-creator-poinpy-new-netflix-game-about-going-up"/>
        <updated>2022-06-10T21:30:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Play it on iOS or Android with a Netflix account
They did it! They finally got me to play a Netflix-backed video game. That's the allure of something new from Ojiro Fumoto, the creator of Downwell. The designer's last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, Poinpy, is about going up, up, up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDA33JqHIjE
If this is your first time, here's how it works: you can download Poinpy as a standalone app on Android or iOS, but to play it, you'll need a Netflix subscription (or someone's login). After launching the game, it'll ask you to sign into Netflix — and even choose your individual profile if you're sharing your sub — before playing. In other words, it's a self-contained experience and you don't even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.
As the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You'll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like Downwell, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.
It's super vibrant, and while they look pretty different aesthetically speaking, Poinpy and Downwell feel like they belong on the same family tree. It's tricky! I'm not great at it.
Fumoto partnered with Netflix Games and Devolver Digital, and maybe if we're lucky we'll see Poinpy eventually land on other platforms. For now, though, this really feels like a game that was designed for touch controls. I'm sure it could work elsewhere just fine — and that'd be cool — but if you've got a Netflix account handy, give it a shot.
Heh, "Poinpy." Cute lil name.

Some games getting shown off this June are still a ways off, but a few do arrive with a surprisingly soon release date. Today, Arc System Works unveiled one of those with Ground Divers, an intriguing puzzle action game that's hitting Switch on June 30.
This new game was shown during today's IGN Expo, highlighting a bunch of different upcoming projects. Ground Divers is a bit more in the classic arcade vein, but with some cool modern updates.
The game sees you piloting a little mining robot named Tsuruhashi, as you plunge the depths for valuable rare minerals. As you plunge deeper, both rocks and enemies will stand in your way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J19CpadX-Zk
What appeals to me about Ground Divers is how it's adding some new ideas to the standard dig-action game. The Pit Relay system looks like you can set up little bases as you dive deeper, and even get little robot pals to help you out.
Dive to the mantle
It's kind of a weird genre to describe, but digging-based puzzle action games are usually a good time. From classics like Dig Dug and Mr. Driller to the excellent SteamWorld Dig series, it's consistently engaging to dive deeper and deeper in search of surprises.
It seems like Ground Divers is taking its own approach to the concept by adding some cool ideas like the relays and cheering on Tsuruhashi. Plus, the whole trailer has a charm to it. I dig (ha) the Saturday morning anime vibes here.
Ground Divers lands on Nintendo Switch on June 30, 2022.

Nacon is joining the long list of publishers dropping dates for its own summer live stream presentation. Nacon Connect 2022, which is scheduled to take place on July 7, will feature a slew of reveals, updates, and trailers pertaining to the company's catalog of upcoming games, accessories, and development projects.
"This year, NACON Connect is reinventing itself in its format and will feature even more content for gamers," said the company in a press release. "Two pre-show and post-show sessions will be added and hosted by renowned influencers. The conference will be the occasion to announce several major projects, reveal new trailers and exclusive gameplay, and introduce new accessories that will delight all gamers."
While Nacon is expected to reveal the show's itinerary at a later date, we can snugly assume that we'll be seeing updates on the cyber revolution RPG Steelrising, Daedalic's action-adventure title The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, and Teyon's previously teased RoboCop: Rogue City. Nacon promises new trailers, exclusive gameplay footage, and the debut of several new accessories from the company's hardware division.
Nacon Connect 2022 will go live on July 7 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST and can be watched on the official Nacon YouTube and Twitch channels. I may not be a "renowned influencer", but I'll also do my best to bring you any pertinent news from the stream right here on Destructoid.

After an unfortunate rollout of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 special edition pre-order system, Nintendo says they're taking another crack at it.
Everything seemed OK on the surface. Nintendo was having pre-orders take place on the My Nintendo store on June 8, with a "limit of two per account." So far, so good. Then it actually launched.
Immediately after the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 special edition went on sale, the entire Nintendo storefront crashed. Folks were greeted with some combination of a 404 page or a "queue," that took an indeterminate amount of time to load and didn't have a progress bar. I came in a little after the initial rush and was taken out of the queue after roughly 10 minutes, and plopped onto a buggy store pa…]]></summary>

The Spotlight showcased nine unique experiences, with much-anticipated titles like A Plague Tale: Requiem and Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, and some lesser-known indie games that deserve a spot on players' to-watch list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a sweet symphony
Netflix has confirmed a new Castlevania animated series is on the way, and it's centered around a new Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is officially in production for Netflix, featuring Richter Belmont.
The new trailer from Netflix's Geeked Week stream doesn't show too much, other than a good look at Richter himself. Still, he's here, in full Belmont garb and whip in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONqNEPTPyqU
Richter is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, so that should make for an interesting continuation of the show. And longtime Castlevania fans are probably already very excited about Nocturne tackling Richter, considering his source material. Video game Richter means both Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night could be fodder for adaptation.
The series will be led by showrunner Kevin Kolde and creator/writer Clive Bradley, and produced by Project 51 Productions with production services from Powerhouse Animation.
Rondo round the world
Considering the Castlevania Netflix series has traditionally been a looser adaptation of the source material, I wouldn't expect Castlevania: Nocturne to be a full-on retelling of Rondo of Blood or Symphony of the Night. That said, Richter alone provides a lot of fodder for potential story beats between those two games. Plus, having Richter here means we could see the return of Alucard. Who doesn't want that?
We got a tease of this last year, but it's excellent to see the Castlevania adaptations are carrying on. While the streaming service has had some standouts in the adaptation department, Castelvania remains one of my favorites. The storming-the-castle finale of Season 2 is forever seared in my brain. I'm more than ready for some adventures with Richter.

This news comes from Day 5 of Netflix's 2022 Geeked Week, which also highlighted various Netflix games and TV shows based on existing video game properties. Netflix originally announced The Cuphead Show way back in 2019, and it finally hit Netflix earlier this year. Shortly after – three weeks later, to be exact – Netflix revealed that it was renewing The Cuphead Show for a second season. Today's teaser doesn't seem to be about that second season but rather additional episodes of Season One. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here's what Netflix has to say about these new episodes:

2004's sequel to the original Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance — which saw a remastered release on Switch and other platforms back in May 2021 — is getting the same treatment; Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is pencilled in for a "Summer 2022" release on Switch and other platforms.
Developer Black Isle Studios teased earlier this year that it was coming "sooner than you think". For Nintendo-exclusive gamers who never had an Xbox or PS2, this will be the first opportunity to play the action-RPG sequel as it skipped Nintendo platforms originally — a disappointment to GameCube owners who enjoyed the original Dark Alliance.

Netflix's Sonic Prime is coming sometime in the future, and after learning a bit about its voice cast a few weeks back and Shadow being revealed during the Sonic anniversary stream the other day, we thought we'd seen the last of the animated show for now. The streaming titan had other plans, of course, with the debut of a brand new clip, which confirmed one of my favorite friends of the speedy hedgehog.

In the embedded tweet above, you can watch the 30-second trailer where none other than Big the Cat from Sonic Adventure and his best friend Froggy are introduced. Sonic spins the iconic (yes, I said iconic) duo as he dashes through the Mobius environment...and then they go their separate ways so Sonic can save some of their friends. It was yet another all-too-quick look at the series that's starting to shape up more in my eyes as the supporting cast is revealed. When will we see Charmy Bee and the rest of the Chaotix? Where will Nack the Weasel make his appearance? My hope is they'll show up eventually.
Sonic Prime is still in the "coming soon" camp of releases at Netflix but will be exclusively available on that platform when it releases.]]></summary>

Today, during the Netflix Geeked livestream, we got our first look at a successor series called Castlevania: Nocturne. Set hundreds of years after the original series, Richter Belmont takes up the whip and will continue the fight of his ancestors. Richter is the protagonist of the 1993 video game, Castlevania Rondo of Blood (also known as Dracula X). He is also of the same bloodline as the Sypha and Trevor from Netflix's first series.
Nocturne is executive produced by Kevin Kolde, with Sam Deats in the director's chair with assistant director Adam Deats. In the show, Richter will be searching for vampires in 1792 in the midst of the French Revolution. He won't be alone in his journey: Maria Renard is also along for this dark ride.
Are you a fan of Netflix's Castlevania work? If so, what do you hope to see from this sequel series and a Belmont rising?]]></summary>

That’s essentially the cut and thrust of Moving Pictures Interactive’s roguelite co-op action adventure Shoulders Of Giants, coming to the Epic Games Store later this year. They’re not quite a 21st century Banjo-Kazooie, but they’ll do in a pinch.

During yesterday's Summer Game Fest 2022 live stream, publisher Capcom dropped a trailer for its clumsily titled retro compilation Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium.

Among the famous brands featured in the new collection are gothic fighter Darkstalkers, ring-rocker Muscle Bomber/Saturday Night Slam Masters, action-platformers Mega Man and SonSon, and frantic shmups Hyper Dyne Side Arms, 1943 Kai, and Exed Exes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming to the Epic Games Store on PC
Did you know there's an Epic Games Store showcase going on right now? Me neither! More Lord of the Rings-licensed games are on the way beyond that vague EA mobile project and the Gollum title; as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was just announced today.
The trailer opens up at the Doors of Durin, before showcasing a group of dwarves (players) quite literally heading back into Moria. Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.
Here's a quick description that sums up the vibe:
"To survive the treacherous mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain."

Eight-player co-op is on the table, which is likely one of the bigger selling points of Return to Moria for the studio. A spring 2023 window for the Epic Games Store is teased. The copyright is with Middle-earth Enterprises (not the Tolkien Estate), so like other similar projects, they'll be limited in what they can cover from The Legendarium (as is customary for the vast majority of Tolkien-related media). But given that the core book series pretty much gives them free rein on Moria, they should be good there.

In the turn-based strategy title, you explore dreams and memories, and it was referred to by Geoff Keighley on Netflix's Geeked Week stream as "a mix between Into the Breach, Hades, Inception, and dodgeball." That's not your everyday video game description.
The art style will look memorable to anyone who has played the developer's previous games and its debut trailer feels very atmospheric, which you can watch above.  The main character discusses their vivid dreams and memories and people she's been struggling to return to, alluding to words left unsaid that stand in her way. Sounds like it's also going to be a poignant ride. 
The game will be available exclusively for Netflix members, with no ads, extra fees, or in-app purchases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dragon Age is coming to Netflix
Today, Netflix and BioWare announced a new collaboration to bring Dragon Age to the streaming platform. Dragon Age: Absolution is a new series set in the world of Thedas, arriving this December on Netflix.
Shown off during today's Netflix Geeked stream, Dragon Age: Absolution is a six-episode series. It'll follow a set of new characters from the world of Dragon Age. That includes elves, Qunari, mages, knights, and some other surprises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1PSiPSs_k
Dragon Age: Absolution is set in Tevinter, which has some interesting implications. Plus, with the next Dragon Age game also heading Tevinter, the Netflix series could potentially set up storylines. Or it might just be a good entry point for newcomers. Either way, Tevinter is definitely an interesting place to go; it's a region full of magic, mystery, and intrigue.
The Dread Wolf nears
As for the Dragon Age series in the gaming realm, BioWare recently announced the title for its next entry. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be the next mainline game, with the player heading to Tevinter and dealing with a lingering threat in Solas.
The latest Dragon Age has been in development for a while, and BioWare has confirmed it won't launch in 2022. Basically, it's going to be a while before we get a new virtual adventure in Thedas. In the meantime, this streaming series will be something for fans to dig into and pick apart, at the least.
Dragon Age: Absolution is another step of Netflix diving deeper into the world of video game adaptations, too. A new Cyberpunk anime was already announced, and its live-action Resident Evil adaptation arrives soon. Today's stream also had news about Netflix's Tekken series, The Cuphead Show, and the next book of Dota: Dragon's Blood. And now, the streaming service will break into the fantasy world of Thedas.

Today, on Netflix's Geeked Week stream, it revealed a new game called Lucky Luna for iOS and Android, which will appear later this summer on Netflix's streaming service. The game is free for all Netflix subscribers. 
Lucky Luna features entirely pixel art and is a vertically scrolling, platformer dungeon crawler. The big catch? You have no jump button to get around. Players swipe left and right to guide Luna through trap-filled dungeons with hidden secrets and alternate paths.
Every level presents a different environment and new mechanics that allow players to explore in a new way. In the story mode, your main goal is to collect as many pearls as possible to advance to the next stage.  You'll also find new clues and light story elements to learn more about Luna's past and discover her purpose.
Lucky Luna will also support an endless mode with procedurally generated runs for every environment. This is where you can make a name for yourself on the leaderboards. Your score is based on your speed, collected peals, and the number of floors you've descended. Gather enough treasure from your runs and you unlock additional endless dungeons to keep the run going. 
Lucky Luna debuts later this summer.]]></summary>

And it seems like they've been doing that, as a year later, they've returned with a new trailer, showing off some of those redesigns, as you can see in the trailer above and the tweet below.

The trailer aired during today's IGN Expo livestream and it features quite a unique spin on The Walking Dead franchise that we haven't seen before. It looks like a game – its art style is reminiscent of Telltale's series but a little less comic book-ey – but it doesn't appear to actually be a game. Instead, it's a multiplayer interactive event that will somehow task players (viewers?) with determining the events that happen, such as the outcome of the characters shown in the trailer. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here's more about it from Skybound Games: 
"From Skybound Games comes The Walking Dead: Last Mile which is part game, part interactive live experience as it relies on the audience to determine its outcome. It's a massively interactive live event that is a Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch exclusive series." 
Last Mile begins exclusively on Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch on July 11.]]></summary>

We had the chance to sit down and watch a hands-off presentation of the Cuphead DLC, hosted by Chad, Jared, and Maja Moldenhauer; as well as Studio MDHR producer Eli Cymet. Kicking things off Cymet framed the presentation by noting that this was a "…]]></summary>

We here at Nintendo Life are always hungry because, while not many are aware, writing about Nintendo everyday works up a massive appetite. So it’s only natural that when the new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer revealed another food-themed Pokémon, we couldn’t help but wonder how it would taste.

All The New Pokémon In Pokémon Scarlet & Violet

Scarlet and Violet aren’t the only games with edible Pokémon in them, however. Of the approximately 37 billion Pokémon now discovered, we uncovered 11 food-themed Pokémon and their evolutionary lines – excluding fish, most plants, and Pokémon that otherwise have no food motif (hey, we love us some jamón but we're not throwing Lechonk in here just yet) – and ranked them by how much we’d want to eat them. No, we haven’t had lunch yet. Why do you ask?

This news comes from Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the development of Ragnarok say PlayStation plans to release it in November. Furthermore, the publication reports that two of those three people expect PlayStation to announce an exact release date later this month. 


Ragnarok was originally due out in 2021, according to its 2020 reveal, but Sony delayed it to 2022 in June of last year. Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge, who also performs motion capture for the character, revealed later that year that a surgery he had to get may have been responsible for the delay.

The Fallout 76 Dread Island storyline has been extended, as part 2 of the new radio play drama is out: you can listen to it now!
The meta narrative follows the brother and sister team of Anna and Emilio, alongside of their very Lost in Space-esque robot companion H-4RT, as they explore and survive Dread Island.  Bethesda is saying that the "final two chapters" will arrive next week. In a really cool turn, you can listen to these radio plays in-game via your Pip-Boy (on the Pirate Radio station).
In other Fallout 76 news, Season 9 and the Test Your Metal update is set to arrive on June 14, which will inject a ton of new content into the game beyond the typical season pass refresh. The team reminds folks that extra public events will be available (Ruse Eagle Arena, Moonshine Jamboree, and Eviction notice), as well as quality of life upgrades like spotting downed enemies with a more obvious yellow highlight.
This weekend is also hosting a "Gold Rush" event: "Throughout this weekend, you can visit the Gold Press Machines at The Crater and Foundation to exchange your Treasury Notes for up to double the usual daily amount of Gold Bullion."

It also reveals that the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime this fall. 
That’s exciting news for fans of games with lots of bullets, blood, and more because it’s right around the corner. Gungrave G.O.R.E. was first announced back in 2021 with a flashy (and again, very gory) gameplay trailer. If you’re excited, be sure to watch today’s new trailer: 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. is about the anti-hero Grave doing what he does best: mowing down undead targets using his twin pistols and weaponized coffin. Back in 2021, Prime Matter revealed that former Platinum Games and Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura was lending her artistic talents to the game as a character designer. You can tell, too, because these characters look great!
Gungrave G.O.R.E. is slated for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC and it will be released sometime this fall.

Indeed, for the first time in the mainline timeline since his franchise debut, Guile is rocking a sweet pair of eye caterpillars, proving that it was well worth me buying that PS5 console after all.

I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Star, Dream Land 3, and Dream Course
Nintendo just added three new Kirby SP games to the Switch Online service: building upon the existing original versions that already existed on Switch. As a reminder, "SP" versions are modified editions of Switch Online NES or SNES games that essentially have a "cheat/unlock" save out of the box. That's really it.
Breaking this down, here's what the Switch Online Kirby SP games do:
Kirby Super Star SP: You get Revenge of Meta Knight mode access immediately
Kirby's Dream Land 3 SP: An easier difficulty/extras are available
Kirby's Dream Course SP: Extras unlocked, including more multiplayer stages (this is probably the most useful of the three)
SP versions started off as a cute little flight of fancy bonus, but at this point people are asking for an option to hide them entirely from the interface: which has become more unwieldy and bloated as more games have been added. Initially "SP" seemed like something special, like maybe an official ROM hack or a different edition of a classic game: but they turned out to just be, by and large, save-doctored retreads.
Another issue is that Nintendo potentially sees these as "updates," which slows down future games from becoming part of the service sooner. It's tough to tell what the actual cadence of games is for the Switch Online service by any metric, as "slow" generally sums it up: from the launch of the NES service all the way to the current era of Nintendo 64 and Genesis.

"No," I said. "No way. Not a chance. I wouldn't like it." People were shocked at my refusal. "But nothing will go wrong!" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

One of Sony's heavy-hitters this year may still be on target. A new report indicates God of War Ragnarok is on track for a November launch, with a release date reveal expected later this month.
Bloomberg reports via three sources familiar with the project that God of War Ragnarok is planned for November. This comes after an earlier report that the new God of War had slipped to 2023.
Jason Schreier of Bloomberg cast doubt on the 2023 news yesterday. His new report seems to affirm that Ragnarok will arrive this year. No dates are set in stone with development, but the report indicates that as of this week, it's still on track for November. Bloomberg's report does note that Ragnarok has slipped internally. Earlier this year, it was reportedly set to arrive in September, but was recently bumped to November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE-4GvjKcfs
This is some reassuring news for fans who might have been concerned after God of War Ragnarok was absent from both the Sony State of Play and yesterday's Summer Game Fest. The follow-up to 2018's God of War has been a hotly anticipated game since it was first teased.
Fimbulwinter in November
While some ratings board movement indicated Ragnarok may still be set for this year, today's report adds some more certainty. As of this writing, Sony has not officially announced a date for God of War Ragnarok, outside a 2022 window.
It's been a leaky couple of days for Sony, as The Last of Us Remake news slipped out ahead of schedule yesterday. The rekindling of the original Last of Us was set to be the closer for Summer Game Fest.
The June State of Play held last week focused mainly on third-party titles, so it's no surprise people are curious about what Sony's first-party lineup looks like right now. Hopefully as the summer of games news rolls on, we'll get a firmer idea of what's in store for PlayStation.

Typically, Nintendo has been updating the My Nintendo physical reward storefront (paid for by way of platinum points currency) with every first-party release. Switch Sports got a towel, and now Mario Strikers: Battle League has a drawstring bag.
The bag is 600 platinum points, clocks in at 15"x18", and is double-sided (the front showcases the main logo, while the back has more roster members suited up in various poses). You can find the listing for it here.
Nintendo also has another little bonus: Mario Strikers party favors. By redeeming 30 platinum here, you can print seven pages of stuff yourself, including "eight invitations, four cupcake holders, six pennant flags, and six party toppers."
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 16 at 6PM ET
So remember when Geoff Keighly said that he thinks publishers have learned that they should probably have "30 minutes plus" conferences, or less micro-conferences in general? Well Square Enix has a 10 minute Final Fantasy VII stream planned for June 16 at 6PM ET.
For reference, here's the quote:
“There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that…I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.”

Welp!
The stream kicks off below at 6PM ET on June 16, with the following caveat from Tetsuya Nomura: "At only around 10 minutes long, it will be short and sweet, but we have packed in lots of information, so I hope everyone can look forward to the unveiling." Add it to the pile! Less obvious candidates include a tease for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 or some new media project; more obvious candidates are mobile developments for VII-related projects.
If Square Enix doesn't show anything related to Part 2  in this Final Fantasy VII stream, they're just setting themselves up for disappointment. Can you imagine the reaction if it was just a stream for First Soldier and Ever Crisis?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced a broadcast happening next week for Final Fantasy VII’s 25th-anniversary celebration. 
More specifically, the “celebration broadcast” will air on June 16 at 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET on the official Square Enix YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, the answer is simple: Final Fantasy VII. This could be a stream specifically about the original release, which hit store shelves 25 years ago. But, as any Final Fantasy fan knows (and if you’re like me, hopes), we might hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake, or rather, its sequel. 
Join us next week for around 10 minutes to celebrate 25 years of @FinalFantasy VII: https://t.co/y074ldZMhg
#FFVII25th. Please be excited. pic.twitter.com/DskOd2CxQj
June 10, 2022
Here’s what Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura says about the stream: 
Perhaps I’m reading too much into this but let’s put some pieces together: Nomura directed Final Fantasy VII Remake. This is a stream celebrating Final Fantasy VII. Players want to hear about the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Nomura specifically says “unveiling.” What could Nomura unveil? I’m betting the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Of course, the company could just reveal some new Final Fantasy VII merch or even more about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a mobile take on the beloved game, so it’s best to keep your expectations in check. Only time will tell for now, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review, and then check out this story about Nomura promising “even more new FFVII projects” in the future. 
Are you excited about this broadcast? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who's Bad?
The mysterious legacy of the Sonic 3 soundtrack has reared its head once again, as Sega has revealed that upcoming retro compilation Sonic Origins will not feature the original score from the 1994 release. Instead, Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature an "adapted" soundtrack, faithfully recreated by composer Jun Senoue.
Sonic fans had been awaiting news on the Sonic Origins soundtrack situation, well aware that Sonic 3 score is mired in misty red tape due to the alleged input of one Michael Jackson, who supposedly composed some of the game's tracks despite not actually being credited in-game. Since its release, both members of Michael Jackson's team and Sega executives have delivered mixed messages as to whether "The King of Pop" did indeed work on the best-selling Sega Mega Drive title, with no real confirmation either way.
https://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1535011473218494487?s=20&t=PZcbCmTmIdkgAhJn58Zwnw
In a special Sonic Origins live stream held yesterday, social media manager Katie Chrzanowski clarified that the Sonic Origins edition of Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature a recomposed version of the original score, with Senoue even utilizing original Sega Mega Drive technology and his original collection of Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to truly capture that classic 16-bit feel.
While the fact that Sonic 3 is not being 100% replicated in its entirety will be a disappointment to the fanbase, Senoue is one of the best in the biz, with no doubt that the tweaked score will be equally as compelling as the one that Jackson did... I mean did not... write.
Sonic Origins launches June 23 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Shit City (literally that's the name of the city)
After a busy day of Summer Game Festing, I'm pretty much spent, but leave it to Devolver Digital (and Suda) to supercharge my brain for a bit with another chaotic showcase. On one extreme, we saw the adorable 2D-meets-3D storybook adventure The Plucky Squire — and on the other, there was Anger Foot, a face-kicking action game for sickos.
The first gameplay glimpse from developer Free Lives (Broforce, GORN, Terra Nil) looks unhinged. I'm talking "Academy Award winner Russell Crowe in Unhinged" unhinged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1XJv-pylk
It's one of the most no-bullshit, take-it-or-leave-it showings I've seen in a while, and I also appreciate the synopsis, which reinforces this game's unrelenting mood.
"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies," as Devolver Digital and Free Lives put it. "Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks."
I can already tell Anger Foot will be the kind of game where there's an ideal "wow, that went smooth!" way to play, and getting the flow down just right will surely take practice. In the meantime, I'm sure it'll be funny to fumble your way through these setups, too. If you've ever wondered how Hotline Miami would (or could) translate its frantic room-clearing carnage to 3D, well, this is probably the closest we're getting for now.
General mood aside, you don't need to take the reveal trailer's word for it — there's a demo right now on Steam. Anger Foot is planning a 2023 release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a whole vibe
Sometimes, you just have to skate. And sometimes, you make a deal with the devil and you really, really do just have to skate. Skate Story is a game about the latter, coming sometime in 2023.
Shown off during today's Devolver Digital summer showcase, Skate Story is about a deal with the devil. You, as a demon made of glass and pain, have to skate to the moon and swallow it to earn your freedom. Simple enough, right?
Seeing it in motion, though, is something else. It's reminding me of Thumper, but with chiller music and sick kickflips. I've probably watched the trailer below at least a half-dozen times already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6j0zKSXAFE
The camera angle is absolutely wonderful too. Its shown in a way that reminds me of old skate videos. As you course through the underworld, you'll also get new decks, wheels, and trucks, as well as a host of tricks to really add some style to your cruising.
Skating through it all
Skateboarding games are always interesting to me, but even over the last couple years, skating has been reimagined in some fascinating ways. The Ramp put a minimalist spin on just the raw action. And OlliOlli World takes a level-based approach with a story and goals that really added a lot to the experience.
That's what excites me about Skate Story in this trailer. It's a whole different vibe, and one I'm really gelling with the more I see it. Developer Sam Eng has posted some great technical looks at the tricks in play, and they are just a joy to watch.
https://twitter.com/skatestorygame/status/1486147388255395840
Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to nailing some sick tricks in the surreal dream world of Skate Story when it arrives in 2023. It's up on Steam now, if you'd like to add it to your wishlist.

This summer, it's finally time to start the cutest lil' cult you ever did see. Cult of the Lamb will launch on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.
The news was part of today's Devolver Digital summer showcase. In between skits about Mecha-Suda51 and the convergence of all video games, Massive Monster's adorable roguelike-meets-management game finally locked in a release date. We also got a new animated trailer here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI6D2iYCTcU
A demo for Cult of the Lamb is live on Steam today too, ahead of its August launch date. That way you can try out taking over the woods before you buy all the way in.
Building up a new following
Cult of the Lamb follows a little lamb, who narrowly avoids being destroyed only to become beholden to a dark spirit. Paying back your debt means assisting this spirit in taking over the woodlands and destroying the other prophets.
Along the way, you can recruit a following of other happy creatures to do your bidding. That means harvesting crops, building new structures, and gradually constructing a quaint home base you can visit between escapades.

It's a cool town-building twist on the usual action-roguelike formula. I got to demo a build at PAX East earlier this year, and was really own over both by its style and its compelling management.
As the summer showcases start to ramp up, it's nice to see a cool project get locked in for a release date, and so soon at that. Looks like I'll be building up my own following in just a few months.
Cult of the Lamb arrives on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Devolver Digital's Summer Game Fest live stream, a new trailer for Skate Story was revealed. And honestly, you just need to see it. It looks so cool. Check it out: 


For the uninitiated, Skate Story has been floating around for a while. Since 2020, developer Sam Eng has been slowly revealing the game on their own personal Twitter and the official Skate Story account. For the most part, these have been small gameplay videos. But today's trailer finally gives us a peek at the game's story – or at least its general premise. That being, per the trailer, "You are a demon made of glass and pain and yet you must skate." What more could you need? More than that, we got extended looks at gameplay, including the unique art style. The camera angle and shake also look about as close to a real skate video as any video game's gotten thus far.
I don't mean to gush over a game I haven't played yet, but I can't wait to get my hands on Skate Story. Luckily, it's expected to come out on PC next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It's a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it's a JRPG and I dislike those. It's got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it's got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you'll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it's got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year’s Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

        <updated>2022-06-09T20:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.
Originally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today’s reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.
The game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.
Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.
We still have something of a wait before we’ll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we’d be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.
Earlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today's Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game's vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.]]></summary>

First, he revealed a new still from the show, posted above, that reveals the first face shot of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey in the roles of Joel and Ellie, respectively. Prior to this, we’d only seen the characters from behind. The image comes from an episode directed by Druckmann himself, who describes the show as “the most authentic video game adaptation yet”. 
Druckmann then brought Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voice Joel and Ellie in the games, to reveal that the actors appear in the show in undisclosed roles. 
The Last of Us is set to premiere on HBO Max sometime in 2023. The show is being helmed by Druckmann and Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago we got a 13-minute look at Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Montreal's Arkham Knight follow-up that is scheduled to release on October 25. This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing's gameplay.
With Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham's streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.  In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He's brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.
In most of the gameplay, he's in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you'll be able to craft by gathering specific components.
Gotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series' legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Successful lawsuits filed by several Israel-based media companies against three pirate streaming sites are proving tricky to wrap up. A US court previously issued orders for all ISPs to block the sites and instructed third-party service providers to cease doing business with them. The plaintiffs say that since Cloudflare is refusing to comply, the company should be held in contempt of court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of The Blue’s retro-styled dystopian puzzle game American Arcadia shared a little more footage of its creepily camera-laden city at tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase. The Seventies aesthetic and Milton Keynes-esque, city-of-the-future feel shown in previous looks at the game are still very much in evidence – those massive swan statues are boss, and nobody hates monorails, right? Take a Logan’s Run at it yourself by watching the new trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Silver Volition has revealed the Saints Row Boss Factory character creator and it’s now live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC. 
As the name implies, the Boss Factory is a character creator separate to download from the upcoming Saints Row reboot. However, it will attach to Saints Row because the character you create now can be used as your own in Saints Row when it launches August 23. In it, you can do quite a lot too. You can adjust your body type and size, add tattoos and other cosmetics, and so much more. It even appears you can play as your boss nude, or at least close to it. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s what Deep Silver Volition has to say about the experience:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not the first time Geoff Keighley, host of Summer Game Fest Live, has introduced the first-person survival crafting game, Nightingale. He first revealed the title during The Game Awards 2021. But today, he and developer Inflexion Games showed off the studio’s first title with a brand new trailer.
“For this reveal,” explains senior system designer Alexei Pepers in a blog post, “we wanted to pack the trailer with new footage and details for our community to dig into: More giants! Expanded base building! Calculating Automatons! But one new feature we felt needed a little more of a deep dive was the Realm Cards.” These cards give players the power to help craft the game’s procedural world and alter the experience. Check out everything in the video below. 


The team further explains the card-based concept for the game on their website.
Nightingale is still set to release at the end of this year on PC, but today’s trailer didn’t reveal a specific date.]]></summary>

Bloober say it's the "psychedelic experience fans know and love" and has "an expanded plotline", so this doesn't sound like an entirely new game. The freshly revealed Layers Of Fears is being built in Unreal Engine 5. As such, the trailer makes for pleasantly unpleasant viewing.

This news comes by way of a new trailer revealed during today’s Summer Game Fest showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and it answers a question players have been asking for a while now: Just what is Bloober Team developing? Layers of Fears is the answer, and it is a “psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2.” Bloober Team says “the psychedelic experience fans know and love will include an expanded plotline and gameplay direction all created in Unreal Engine 5.”

The retro-inspired beat 'em up launches on June 16. Casey has also been labeled as an unlockable character, meaning he won’t be available to use from the get-go. In another pleasant surprise, the game now has up to six-player online co-op instead of only four. Enemies also scale in size based on the number of players; expect to face a ton of Foot Clan with a six-person squad.

Geoff was joined on stage by Roger Clark (who you will know from being Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption) and Troy Baker (who you will know from, I dunno, throw a dart, you'll hit one) to briefly talk more about their characters and what the hap is heckening in this horror adventure game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chance has always been an integral part of Firaxis’ turn-based tactics games. Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.
It’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detailed-yet-relaxing village builder Ostriv isn't far off one of my favourite games. Entirely unrelatedly, I had Tile Cities installed for about a month before finding time to play it.
Except, it's not unrelated at all. It's the game that Ostriv developer Yevheniy made while suffering through the invasion of Ukraine, "to switch my mind from death and destruction towards peace and creativity". I'd be recommending it for sure even if I hadn't found that out, because it's a terrific little game that's far more engaging than it looks.

What game d'you think would be the best Lego set? Action figures? Obscure 80s and 90s toy? Oh, we have fun on this show.
Diversions this week are predictably about toys we had as kid, including a very long sidebar about Mighty Max, and Matthew's reverse-engineered Boglin hatred derived from his sad childhood. We also have some obligatory Platty Joobs round-up chat, and there's an unintentionally difficult Cavern Of Lies this week, themed around Funko Pop, because any made up Funko Pop is indistinguishable from a real Funko Pop.

It’s a procedurally-generated romp through various mission types such as asteroid mining, battling space pirates and rescuing ships in distress, all spread throughout the galaxy. Introversion have quite a bit more to say on what they call their “broken, unfinished and bug filled prototype“ in their announcement video, which you can watch below.

Today I had a run so overpowered I was afraid to even shoot, and fled explosions I hadn't even intended to cause until I finally exploded myself. That's the good stuff. And it's only £2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inside ActivisionBlizzard there are two wolves. Possibly dire wolves, or some other species of fantastical monster with surplus vowels in the name. Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). 
Diablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.

It's being developed by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind arena-brawler Battlerite that lifts the fights from MOBAs like Dota 2 or League Of Legends and cuts away all the tedious build-up. So quite the departure then? Yes and no. V Rising strikes out as its own thing, but Stunlock's back catalogue definitely bleeds into its combat and exploration and easygoing attitude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal is being pilloried by players for the price of its microtransactions, and for how closely tied your progress is to spending real money. One player on the game's Reddit page has suggested that it would cost between $50k-$80k (around £39k-£64k) to fully max out a character in the free-to-play action RPG. Meanwhile, the game's director has been responding to feedback on Twitter in an attempt to address those "not liking a game based on misinformation surrounding it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite gaming keyboards is discounted at Amazon UK today. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech's reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while 'TKL' stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it's a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our 'best wireless keyboard' recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

The first issue brought the game's multiplayer modes, the second issue brought its singleplayer campaign, the third issue finally fixed its Big Team Battle mode, and the fourth issue - by which time you've possibly lost interest - will bring online co-op for its campaign.

If you're one of those still reading this metaphorical magazine, you can get beta access to the co-op mode this July if you sign up to Halo Insider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I look outside my window, I often see our two cats scrabbling up our back wall as they hop over the fence to visit the neighbour's garden. Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.
"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it," says producer Swann Martin-Raget. "We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us."

This is only available in your first play through in the deluxe version of the game, which I wasn't aware I was reviewing. The feature unlocks in the standard version after you've completed a full play through.
I'm going to do my absolute best to tell you about The Quarry with no spoilers, but it will be hard because a lot of what marks it out as better and cleverer and funner than comparable horrorventure romps is all tangled up in the plot. It's an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot. Broadly, it is the story of a group of camp counselors, one night in a quarry-based summer camp, and how baffling organisational choice can lead to ruin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.
It turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.

Newegg dropped their price on the EVGA Supernova 1000 G6 PSU to $140, and Amazon followed suit soon after. That's $50 below the usual price of $190, and a historic low for this model.
If you've got a high-end system - or you're planning to pick up a power-hungry next-gen graphics card when they launch later this year - then this is an awesome upgrade.

Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

Both editions can be accessed from the Minecraft launcher. They’ll retain their respective features and stay separate from one another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
