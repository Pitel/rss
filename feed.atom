        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 doesn’t premiere in theaters until April 8, but Sega and Paramount Pictures have confirmed that a third film is in the works along with TV spin-off series for Paramount+. 
In a press release, the companies revealed that development of Sonic 3 (or whatever it winds up being called) has already begun. There’s no word on who will be involved, but one would imagine the main cast will stick around along with director Jeff Fowler. Sega and Paramount did not share a release window. 
The live-action TV series features Idris Elba’s Knuckles, who makes his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and will premiere in 2023. It’s unclear if Knuckles is the star of this show or is just the first character confirmed for it but the former sounds more likely. This adds another video game series to Paramount+'s line-up alongside its soon-to-premiere Halo. To avoid potential confusion, this Sonic TV show is a separate project from Sonic Prime, the animated series that debuts on Netflix sometime this year. 
“We’ve got a remarkable partnership with Paramount, and we are excited to continue expanding the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise with them,” says Sega CEO Haruki Satomi in the press release. “2022 is shaping up to be a significant year for the franchise with the second film being released this April, as well as Sonic Frontiers, the highly anticipated video game title, coming this holiday.” 
2022 is indeed a big year for Sonic. As previously mentioned, his first open-world game Sonic Frontiers is slated to arrive later this year. You can read about how that game was originally intended to release in 2021 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A handful of popular Cities: Skylines mods have been banned from the Steam Workshop by developers Colossal Order. One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variety is reporting that Paramount Plus has a few more missions for Master Chief to go on for the streaming network. The television adaptation Halo, based on the game franchise of the same name, is getting a second season prior to the airing of its first season. 
Along with the early renewal of the series, a new showrunner is taking over for the sophomore suite of episodes. According to Variety, Brave New World creator and Fear the Walking Dead co-executive producer, David Wiener will be helming the show moving forward. He'll be taking the place of former showrunners Kyle Killen (who left partway through season one) and Steven Kane. Kane reportedly departed the project after completing the first season due to the "massive scope of the series" and the two years of production it took the first set of episodes to film due to COVID complications. 
There's no word on what kind of threats the UNSC and Master Chief will face in season two of Halo, and we likely won't know until credits roll on the debut season. Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor will reprise her role as the AI Cortana. The show also stars Bokeem Woodbine, Shabana Azmi, Bentley Kalu, Natasha Culzac, Kate Kennedy, Danny Sapani, Olive Gray, and Charlie Murphy.
Halo premieres on Paramount Plus on March 24. Check out a recent trailer for the show here, and read about some legal drama surrounding Halo that could affect the TV series.]]></summary>

The Bioshock games are on their way to the big screen, as Netflix makes moves to turn the series into a movie. The media giant announced their plans on the 15th February on their nerd-culture-focused "Geeked" Twitter account.
The only information we have at this point is that Netflix, 2K, and Take-Two Interactive are collaboratively involved in turning the Bioshock series into a film adaptation — no word yet on which of the games will be part of the adaptation, when it's scheduled for release, or which role they've already case Chris Pratt as. (That's a joke. We hope.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko can't stop, won't stop making new figures based on your favorite brands and properties. This week, we get to take a look at some upcoming game-related products set for release sometime in 2022.

First up is a collection of four Funko Pop figures featuring characters from the upcoming Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Of course, Tiny Tina herself is represented, but so is her trusty diamond unicorn, Butt Stallion. Unfortunately, it's probably not possible to have Tina ride on Butt Stallion's back. Joining that dynamic duo is the big baddie from Wonderlands, Will Arnett's Dragon Lord, along with Paladin Mike, an elite guard sworn to protect Queen Butt Stallion.

Apex Legends already has eight figurines in the Pop collection, and it looks like at least four more are being added in the near future. Slated to hit sometime this year are Wattson, Octane, Revenant, and Crypto. Given that these were the first four additions to the Apex roster, the following eight are likely to show up down the line. Or at least, anyone collecting this set would hope so. 
Which other characters would you like to see get the Funko Pop treatment? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Lynels are the fiercest enemy in Breath of the Wild — fiercer even than most of Ganon's boss forms — and most people would be right to steer well clear of the muscular lads.
But if you have the right tools, Lynels are apparently a piece of cake. And those tools are easy to come by, because one is the Magnesis power, and the other is a large metal boulder.

Even for those of us that aren't active players of Fortnite, there's no denying that the free-to-play juggernaut has set high standards in world building, season pass desirability, IP crossovers and control / accessibility options. The latest update, which should be live for all or rolling out very soon, adds to the control options on Switch and other gyro-compatible platforms.
The Switch has had gyro aiming in Fortnite since day one, but Epic Games states they'll now be 'more robust'. More intriguing is the addition of 'Flick Stick' controls; the video above is from its creator, Julian "Jibb" Smart, explaining how it works and demonstrating cases in-game where it may be useful.

Guardians will soon face off against Savathûn and her Lucent Brood in just one week and to prepare you for the upcoming fight, Bungie has released a new launch trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. 
As you might expect, it features plenty of new haunting imagery of the Witch Queen, plus some new threats from her. Like previous expansion launch trailers, this one is quite cinematic, featuring mostly CGI. If you’ve been paying attention to this expansion, you know Savathûn has been stealing the precious Light of the Guardians. Plus, she has a host of ally enemies that also fight using the light, representing an all-new fight for our own Guardians, who, up until this point, have never fought someone using their own powers.

Of course, Savathûn is thrilled that your Guardian and others are coming to her Throne World. In fact, she’s inviting you in. The trailer also showcases some new looks at the exotics and fancy Glaive weapons coming to Destiny 2 in The Witch Queen expansion. 
The trailer ends with a screen that showcases what you can get for preordering Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, which is the most preordered Destiny 2 expansion in the game’s history. If you preorder the deluxe edition, you’ll receive some instant in-game rewards as well as the Osteo Striga Exotic SMG (and other bonuses) when the expansion is live next week on February 22. 
While waiting for that day, read Game Informer’s preview of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen and then check out some gameplay from it in Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen New Gameplay Today. Read about how Sony and PlayStation are acquiring Destiny 2 developer, Bungie, after that.

In Nintendo's February 2022 Direct, we found out that yet another boon is being added to the rapidly-expanding number of benefits that come with Nintendo's Switch Online Expansion Pack: The 48 DLC tracks for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. We already have access to the catalogue of N64 games (which are being sllllooowwwly rolled out), Mega Drive games, and the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise DLC, for a few extra bucks a month.
On Nintendo Life, we've talked about the NSO Expansion Pack a lot. We've looked at its relative value compared to Sony and Microsoft's (very different) subscription services, said it's great value for some people, despite the fact that it proved extremely controversial when it was revealed. When we asked for reader opinions, the polls came back pretty negative, and later on, we all pretty much universally agreed that the catalogue of games was expanding too slowly for the price of the subscription. And early results from a poll we ran today suggest that, which the upcoming Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC tracks aren't nothing, there's a sizeable number of players for whom the higher tier Expansion Pack isn't sufficiently attractive. Yet.

MLB The Show 22 is going to be an intriguing release on the Switch in early April, with the Nintendo's hybrid system getting a version alongside PS4 / Xbox One and PS5 / Xbox Series X|S. It'll be a fully cross-platform experience too - on Switch you'll be able to take on PlayStation and Xbox players in online matches, and transfer and share your account progress between versions if you have multiple copies.
The game had a Switch trailer in the recent Nintendo Direct, though our feelings from the very brief footage were certainly mixed. Thankfully plenty will be able to take an early look when the game gets an online 'Technical Test' later this week on all platforms. The downside? It's only for players in the United States and Canada, so if - like this scribe - your Switch account is EU-region you're probably out of luck. You need to have Nintendo Switch Online membership to access the test; when it launches we'll test downloading it from the NA eShop and then loading it with our EU-based NSO account, though we suspect this won't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

Many have attempted the impossible task of bringing our favorite video game characters to the silver screen with varying degrees of success. Tom Holland is next in line to try his hand as the iconic Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie, and we're sitting down with him today to hear all about it!
Click here to watch embedded media
Join Brian Shea as he chats with Spider-Man himself to learn everything he can about the PlayStation mascot's debut in movie theaters later this week. Mr. Holland goes into detail about his relationship with Nolan North, what his favorite Uncharted game is of all time, along with more tidbits about the upcoming film. We're even showing off some behind-the-scenes footage to spice up your viewing experience while the two gents chat about the movie.
Are you excited about the Uncharted movie? You don't have to wait long as Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's latest film arrives this Friday only in theaters. If you can't get enough of Nathan Drake and his adventures, you've come to the right place. Be sure to check out Brian Shea's review of the movie, where he says: 
"The Uncharted video games set a high bar for storytelling, and though Uncharted doesn't quite clear that bar, I had a fun time from the very first scene. Through some awe-inspiring action set pieces and strong performances, the film ably showcases the strengths of the game franchise while giving fans a new, albeit slightly familiar storyline."

Suppose you want something a bit more traditional, head over to our YouTube page to watch a fresh episode of New Gameplay Today to check out Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, where we let you know if it's worth picking up for the PlayStation 5!

It was confirmed some time ago that The Ring, or 'Ringu' to use the correct name from Kōji Suzuki’s original movie adaptation, would come to Dead By Daylight. It's an iconic horror franchise, and it's now been announced that the new content will arrive in the The Sadako Rising Chapter on 8th March.
As you can see in the trailer we have new Killer Sadako, but the survivor Yoichi Asakawa is perhaps a more intriguing tie-in. Below is some of the official blurb that explains why that character's appearance is rather notable for the franchise.

Pokémon glitches are a big part of the series — remember Missingno.? — and Pokémon Legends: Arceus has its fair share. Sadly, they're largely graphical ones that don't give you cool powers.

The Hollywood Reporter states that Netflix is partnering with 2K's parent company Take-Two Interactive and Vertigo Entertainment to bring the series to life. The THR report calls this an effort to "develop a potential cinematic universe," which is fitting considering the multiversal events of Bioshock Infinite. Currently, there are no names attached to the project for writing or directing, nor is there any word of which era of Bioshock we'll be seeing on film.

So as an alternative to spending £100-odd for all a game's DLC, Paradox have started dabbling in letting players pay monthly fees to play them. The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

Dune: Spice Wars is an exciting prospect for real-time strategy fans and enthusiasts of the popular books (and recent Oscar-nominated film). The game takes the series back to its RTS roots, though we hadn't seen much of it beyond cinematic teases. However, a new trailer provides the first look at its tactical gameplay.
The trailer shows off how players can command units on Arrakis. You’ll lead your chosen faction using several methods, whether it be flexing political influence, having deep economic pockets, or just pure open warfare. As you travel the world and meet/capture villages, you gather resources and set up spice harvesters to keep the money flowing while using armies to keep attackers at bay. In addition to a single-player campaign, developer Shiro Games previously confirmed multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I made an impassioned plea for more puzzley-jigsaw games, but I did not expect my call to be answered in such a comprehensive fashion so quickly. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

There are a lot of similar games on the Switch eShop, which can be a blessing when you're seeking a particular genre or style. Titles with the creative conviction to be rather different and quirky are a little harder to come by, so in that respect Vostok Inc. remains as a bit of a standout, with developer Nosebleed Interactive showing a flair for clever and humorous game design.
While that game was a combination of 'clicker' gameplay, resource management and twin-stick shooting, the studio's next major venture is entirely different. Targeting a release in Q2 this year, Arcade Paradise once again has business management at its heart, but this time far more grounded in reality - or retro reality anyway. You run a laundrette - which shouldn't really be fun - but of course everyday and occasionally grim activities are given video game spins. Beyond that, though, you're slowly creating and running a backroom arcade.

Ultimate allows you to play these games on PC, too. Plus, you can play ceratin games via Xbox’s cloud streaming service if you’re a subscriber.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["What's Updog?" finally has a coherent answer.
A long time ago in 2002, long before many of you were even born, there was an obscure little Game Boy Advance platform game developed by Denki based on the football man David Beckham. It was called Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island and, quite frankly, it was magnificent. Why are we bringing up a David Beckham platformer? Well, at the risk of inviting some ridicule at the obscurity of this pronouncement, Grapple Dog is essentially its spiritual sequel.
The game's designer may disagree, but we took one look at Grapple Dog's chunky, colourful visuals and immediately assumed it was of Denki pedigree. Everything about it resembles the aforementioned Becks-'em-up, right down to specific HUD elements. Maybe there's no connection. Perhaps we are barking up the wrong tree. But this similarity must be chronicled somewhere and it falls to us; the most specific recommendation imaginable — if you loved Go! Go! Beckham!, you'll love Grapple Dog.

Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

We then dive into the world of video games to dream up games we would like to see. We break down their designs, pick a developer that would fit the project, and discuss what they would play like. As always, we end the show with a list of comics that will be releasing this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of five games, players have gotten to know Nathan Drake as a fearless, debonair, and experienced explorer who laughs in the face of danger seemingly at every turn. Despite the ground crumbling beneath his feet on a regular basis, Nate always survives and keeps pressing towards the ultimate goal. While Nate's mission is typically treasure, the film based on his adventures aptly translates the series' characters to the silver screen while showing viewers a good time along the way. Just like its main character, Uncharted loses its footing a few times en route to its destination. However, once the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel that it accomplished its mission.

For some, it’s when you get a job and start making money.

He’s now 17 years old, and Weaponeer is nearing its big (paid) re-release on February 14. 
While Anderson developed the game exclusively by himself, its re-release features a few extra helping hands in the form of VoxPop Games and charity AbleGamers.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. 
Update 2/14: The following superstars have been confirmed: Dakota Kai, Elias, Io Shirai, Jinder Mahal, Lacey Evans, Mandy Rose, Mansoor, Pete Dunne, and Roddy Piper. 
The confirmed roster so far: 
AJ Styles
Dakota Kai
Kane
Sami Zayn
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 launched over a year ago with many issues, including game-breaking bugs, epileptic triggers, and more. Sadly, these issues led to class action lawsuits and storefront refunds. Despite this, CD Project Red’s futuristic RPG found financial success and was one of the most popular games on Steam in 2020. Mods helped stabilize and enrich the PC experience, while consoles (especially the Xbox One and last-gen PlayStation 4)  struggled…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncharted arrives in theaters on February 18, but if you’d rather read the cinematic adaptation instead, a novelization of the film releases tomorrow. And if you’d rather listen to your books based on blockbuster films based on triple-A video games, Variety reports that the audiobook version has an added dose of authenticity since it’ll be narrated by the original Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North. 
Uncharted: The Official Movie Novelization goes on sale on February 15 and puts the exploits of Tom Holland's Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's Victor “Sully” Sullivan from screen to page. The book is written by sci-fi and horror author S.D. Perry, who previously penned a series of books based on Resident Evil, Alien, Star Trek, and other properties. North, who brought Nathan Drake to life throughout the Uncharted video game series, will lend his talent to the film’s younger spin on the hero. Per Variety, North says he won’t be imitating Holland’s performance one-to-one, saying “I kind of just did me. I tried to young him up a little bit.” North also provides his spins on Walhberg’s Sully as well as its other characters including Antonio Banderas' villain, Moncada.  
Now that we're a week away from the film premiere, you can whet your appetite by watching Uncharted's airplane scene in its entirety here. You can also read about how the movie's director has his sights on Jak & Daxter for his next project here. Lastly, be sure to check out our new season of our Video Gameography podcast which provides a deep dive into the making and storytelling of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.

Babylon’s Fall, Platinum Games’ upcoming multiplayer action RPG, is getting a free demo on February 25. 
The free demo will only be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 (sorry, PC players) and lets players roam the game’s opening section. Publisher Square Enix states the demo features “multiple hours” of story content that you can tackle alone or alongside buddies in four-player co-op (with cross-play enabled). Demo progress carries over to the full game, which launches on March 3.

The long road to Babylon’s Fall first began with its reveal during E3 2018. The crux of the adventure involves players fighting their way up a tower filled with increasingly difficult enemies and dangers. To survive, you’ll collect weapons and gear to enhance your Sentinel, the playable warrior. Babylon’s Fall is a live-service title that Platinum plans to update with new game modes, story content, equipment, and more post-launch. Platinum states that all of these additions will be free of charge. 
Babylon’s Fall will be available on PlayStation consoles as well as PC. For more on Platinum Games, read about how the studio's top brass wants to resurrect its canceled Xbox action game, Scalebound.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

Horizon Forbidden West hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 this Friday – you can read Game Informer’s review of it right now – and in the leadup to its launch, Guerrilla Games has released a detailed look at its accessibility settings. 
Fortunately, there are a lot of them too ranging from general accessibility to controller-specific settings as well as audio and visual options, too. The game even includes multiple difficulty settings so that you can tailor Aloy’s latest journey to be perfect for you.

A new cinematic trailer for Horizon Forbidden West released today by Guerrilla Games and PlayStation showcases both the stunning locales in Aloy’s newest journey and her greatest hunt yet. 
If you’ve been paying attention to PlayStation as of late, you know they’ve significantly ramped up the marketing for Forbidden West, its next first-party title hitting PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18. Most trailers have been about specific things within the sequel, such as salvage contracts and challenges, or new looks at gameplay running on different PlayStation consoles. Today’s trailer, however, is the most cinematic look we’ve received of Forbidden West yet and you can watch it below:

As you can see in the trailer, it shows Aloy’s journey across the Forbidden West. It starts in somewhat familiar territory before we see Aloy encounter some vicious dinosaur machines. We then get a new look at swimming mechanics in Forbidden West as well as a glimpse at a fight against one of the game’s new Elephant machines. Throughout the entire journey, Aloy narrates what is her biggest hunt – unknown to us at the moment – that takes her to the Forbidden West. 
It’s a great trailer and certainly one worth watching if you’re excited about this sequel. After watching it, watch this “Meet the Cast” of Horizon Forbidden West trailer and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in Horizon Forbidden West. Check out this story about how Horizon Zero Dawn has surpassed 20 million copies sold, just a week before the release of Horizon Forbidden West, after that.

Capcom fans have been enjoying some fantastic games as of late. Between Resident Evil remakes, new entries in the long-running horror series, or beasts to hunt in Monster Hunter Rise, Capcom has been providing players with plenty to do. And now, the company is providing fans with something new to do: stare at a mysterious countdown. 
Perhaps as a Valentine’s Day surprise, Capcom tweeted out a random link today and upon clicking it, you’re brought to a relatively blank screen that features a countdown both in days and in hours. At first glance, it’s not really teasing anything, ex…]]></summary>

PowerTOP continues to see occasional commits and new releases, but there's less talk about it these days than going back a number of years when it was a must-have for x86_64 laptops.

Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

Game Informer editor John Carson is streaming Lost Ark all weekend long on the GI Twitch channe. We'll be streaming from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Central today whether the game is live yet or not!
Come watch and check out the free-to-play title and hang out for some epic drops. That's right!

Then, all you need to do is sit back and watch.
Don't forget to follow the Game Informer Twitch channel to know when we're live with our recurring weekly streams like Multiplayer Mondays, whatever-we-want-to-play Thursdays (name in progress), and Super Replay at its regularly scheduled time at 2 p.m. Central on Friday afternoons.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline entries in Naughty Dog's blockbuster action series, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  
Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console. Released on November 19, 2007, Uncharted brought Naughty Dog into a bold new era of "mature" game development. In this week's episode, we talk about Naughty Dog's history developing titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, how the studio was largely unprepared for the challenges of Uncharted's development. We also talk about how Naughty Dog almost designed a game similar to BioShock, how Johnny Knoxville served as inspiration for Nathan Drake, and how Gears of War's release changed Uncharted's design for the better. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and ex-Game Informer editor and host of the CrossFade podcast Matt Helgeson (@MattHelgeson) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's video game debut.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Traditionally MMOs are best played on mouse and keyboard, but Lost Ark isn’t a traditional game, is it? Before I get carried away, know you’ll probably have a better experience playing this isometric action RPG with classic inputs. However, Lost Ark is playable with a controller, if not entirely enjoyable. I’d even argue combat feels best on a controller, despite the general awkwardness of navigating menus, inventories, and action bars on a gamepad.
Regardless of how you’re playing Lost Ark, tedium will soon set in if you don’t learn its many hotkeys and controller shortcuts. With convenience in mind, I …]]></summary>

It's surprising how well the same design still works when the letters are replaced by numbers, and you're instead relying on your ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

That's what you're doing in Nerdle, which is Wordle for maths fans.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is a fun and ambitious game, but it’s not without technical drawbacks. Earlier today, Techland dropped a patch for consoles and PC designed to squash various bugs while bolstering the adventure with some improvements.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion of 2022 is finally ready to launch, and as such, we're here to crack open a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. The expansion includes more 170 cards, including 4 Pokémon VStar cards, 20 Pokémon V, and 3 Pokémon VMax cards. In addition, Brilliant Stars features 30 Trainer Gallery cards with special art, more than 20 Trainer cards, and a new Special Energy card.
We were sent a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. When I opened up all the packs and sorted through my pulls, I was pleased with the generational spread. While Kanto and Galar Pokémon continue to be well-represented, I noticed more Sinnoh monsters this time around. With Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl hitting just last year, and Legends: Arceus launching last month, this feels like a smart move.
My favorite cards this time around happen to fall into the Gen I category. While it's true I hold Gen I in the highest regard (thanks mostly to nostalgia), I like to think that these cards are my favorites not because of that nostalgia, but instead due to the classic-facing designs of these full-art cards. The clean art of the Pikachu V and Raichu V cards immediately caught my eye, and I always consider it a great day when I can pull a Charizard. Of course, having just put a ton of hours into Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it was cool to also pull the titular Pocket Monster from these packs. I also really like some of the Trainer cards included in this expansion, which is not something I can say about every set.
You can see the more than 20 cards I deemed my favorites in the gallery below.

Since it was released last June, Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny has been available exclusively on Switch in the US despite it also launching on PlayStation 4 in Japan. Sony and PC fans waiting patiently to play the quirky strategy game only have hold out for a few more months now that NIS America has confirmed the game is heading to PlayStation consoles and PC this summer. 
This new edition of the game, called Disgaea 6 Complete, will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4. It includes every DLC character and cosmetic that was released as part of the game’s season pass. Those additions include familiar faces such as: 
Girl Laharl from Disgaea 1
Adell and Rozalin from Disgaea 2
Mao and Raspberyl from Disgaea 3
Valvatorez, Desco, and Fuka from Disgaea 4
Killia and Usalia from Disgaea 5

Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny is the first game in the series to adopt a 3D polygonal art style, moving away from its traditional sprites. The game stars Zed, a zombie with the ability to repeatedly resurrect himself, and become stronger, as a result, thanks to the game’s new Super Reincarnation system. He and his friends are the only things that can stop a dangerous God of Destruction. 
There’s no exact release date for the Disgaea 6 Complete, but NIS America hopefully divulges that info sooner than later.]]></summary>

Lost Ark has been making plenty of waves this week as it debuted in western countries for the first time. Although the MMORPG is free-to-play, the first few days of access have only been available for those who purchased a Founder's Pack. Despite that minor and temporary price gating, Lost Ark has been pulling some impressive numbers with over 500,000 concurrent players in the first two days. The popularity of the title has led to some adjustments to where new players can create characters and the opening of new servers to accommodate the audience starting to play this week.

Players were still experiencing issues with missing characters after downloading the new patch, however, and so servers have been taken offline "to get this resolved."
An earlier tweet from the Lost Ark account said that as compensation for the delays they "will add 3 days of Crystalline Aura to all players who log in to the game between launch and 9 AM PT [5 PM UTC] on 2/13 as a small thank you."

Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

Horizon Forbidden West hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18 and it seems players are excited to return to Aloy’s journey because its predecessor, Horizon Zero Dawn, just surpassed a new milestone: 20 million copies sold. 
It’s no surprise – Zero Dawn is one of PlayStation’s best-selling games and it makes sense that more people picked it up in the run-up to Forbidden West. What better way to catch up on the story of Aloy’s first journey in the original 2017 game? Still though, 20 million is a massive number. 
Wow, Horizon Zero Dawn has officially sold over 20 MILLION copies around the world across PS4 and PC! What an incredible achievement @Guerrilla, and a big thank you to our hugely supportive fans!

“Wow, Horizon Zero Dawn has officially sold over 20 million copies around the world across PS4 and PC,” PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst wrote on Twitter today. “What an incredible achievement [Guerrilla Games], and a big thank you to our hugely supportive fans. Now, let’s get ready to visit Horizon Forbidden West in a week.” 
On top of that, Hulst also revealed that more than 1 billion hours of Horizon Zero Dawn has been played. That’s a lot of destroyed machines. 
As Hulst notes, Forbidden West hits PlayStation next week, on February 18, and while waiting for that day, catch up on all of Game Informer’s Horizon Forbidden West coverage. Check out the latest trailer that showcases challenges, arenas, and salvage contracts and then watch his “Meet the Cast” trailer. Read Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Horizon Forbidden West after that.

Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

Hie thee to Steam to try a free full-game trial of XCOM 2 complete with its excellent expansion, War Of The Chosen. While the free trial only runs for a few days, if you want to keep playing, the game has some daft discounts right now—like '£6 for XCOM 2 and all the DLC and everything' daft. Ridiculous bargain.

Ubisoft’s upcoming Dawn of Ragnarok expansion for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is right around the corner – it hits the game on March 10 – and just one day after Game Informer’s preview of it went live, the company has released a new six-minute overview trailer that showcases what to expect. 
In Dawn of Ragnarok, players will control Eivor, under the guise of Odin, in the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim, which has been invaded. It picks up after the conclusion of the Norse realm story seen in the base Assassin’s Creed Valhalla game and while players are encouraged to reach a power level of 340, if you just want to jump right into the action, a power level boost awaits you at the start. And you’ll need it too if you want to survive battles through magma-infused Muspels and the icy realm of Jotnar while Odin seeks to defeat the fire giant Surtr and save Baldr. 
You’ll learn about all that and more in Ubisoft’s latest Dawn of Ragnarok overview trailer, which you can watch below:

As you can see in the trailer above, it goes over basically everything you can expect in this expansion – powers, equipment and gear, the story, trials and challenges, puzzles, how it affects Eivor, and more. 
If you’re looking for even more information about the game, be sure to read Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok preview and then check out our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click here to watch embedded media
Since retro games became, well, retro, many studios making games today have attempted to emulate the music, art, style, and feel of classics like Castlevania, Super Metroid, and others. Nostalgia for games like that helps them a lot in many cases, but that only gets you so far – at the end of the day, you do actually need to create a great game when attempting to dig back into the treasure chest that is 8-bit and 16-bit action-adventure gameplay. I'm happy to report that Berzerk Studio's Infernax, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on February 14, has been a blast so far. 
While I've not completed the game just yet, there's plenty within that I want to keep a secret for yourself to view in the full game. However, if you've not heard of Infernax or are looking for more information about it, we have you covered with the first 15 minutes of the game (and if you're anything like me, these first 15 minutes will sell you on the game quite well). 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Ben Reeves, and Marcus Stewart talk and walk you through the first 15 minutes of Infernax. Is it hitting the highs of the games it's inspired by? Find out in this special preview video. Thanks for watching and be sure to let us know what you think of Infernax.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

With so many amazing indie titles released last year, you’d think it would be tough for 2022 to measure up. But somehow, this year is just as ridiculously stuffed with awesome-looking experiences. Independent creators are bringing their triple-I-games with titles that range from an action-packed Kung Fu epic to an unsettlingly cute community builder. Presented in chronological release order, here’s our list of the indie games we are most looking forward to in 2022.

Lost Ark launches for Western audiences this week, with its three-day early access event starting today. Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate's RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I've had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I'm not comfortable drop…]]></summary>

It's a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch's library grows.

PlayStation's Twitter is having a whole morning of indie announcements, and Devoured Studios' newest game Salt and Sacrifice joined the party with a PS Blog post about its PvP and a sneaky announcement of its release date on May 10. 
Like its predecessor and From Software's Souls games it's heavily inspired by, Salt and Sacrifice will give players the option to invade others' worlds and impede their progress through PvP battles. As an Inquisitor, your charge is to rid the world of mages who have succumbed to and have become agents of chaos. Depending on the factions you'll choose throughout the adventure, …]]></summary>

Sometimes, a Magic: The Gathering set comes along that breaks multiple boundaries you thought would never be considered, or at least not for a while longer. Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty is one of those sets. Not only did Wizards of the Coast bring us back to this often maligned, yet fan-favorite plane based on Japanese mythology, but we're seeing it 1200 years in the future from when we last stepped foot on Kamigawa. For the first time ever, Magic has gone high-tech with this new take on Kamigawa introducing plenty of neon lights, mechs, and transforming equipment to join the familiar sights …]]></summary>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is among the most exciting releases for nostalgic fans of beat 'em ups. We still don’t have a release date for the arcade-inspired brawler, we now know that the Turtles’ wise teacher, Master Splinter, is joining the fray. We also have confirmation that the game is heading to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside Switch and PC. 
Splinter kicks all kinds of tail in his trailer, including bashing foes with his staff and executing a Street Fighter-style hurricane kick of all things. Splinter is the second non-Turtle playable character alongside April O’Neil. Could Casey Jones be next? Miyamoto Usagi? We’ll have to wait and see.

As you all know, Tom Holland truly manifested his rise to prominence. A decade ago, the young movie star voiced his interest in donning the iconic Spider-Man spandex, and now he's a beloved household name in the MCU. Holland is also slated to portray Nathan Drake in the upcoming Uncharted movie. However, his latest dream project – a Jak and Daxter film adaptation – might not be a mere delusion of grandeur. Uncharted director, Ruben Fleischer, is set to make a Jak and Daxter movie next.

BAFTA Award-winning co-op adventure Never Alone is finally making its way to Switch later this month. 
More specifically, E-Line Media revealed in a new launch trailer for the Switch version of this heartwarming game that it will hit the handheld-hybrid home console on February 24. That same trailer also has a tease for Never Alone 2 in it, so it's never been a better time to run through the original game.

You'll be able to play through both Never Alone and its Foxtales DLC when the Never Alone: Arctic Collection hits Switch on February 24. As noted in the trailer, E-Line Media has teased a sequel with news that Never Alone 2 is now in pre-production. 
Check out our thoughts on its original release in Game Informer's Never Alone review for more about the indie.

Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell.

That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Square Enix continue to mine middled-aged people's nostalgic memories of long free days sat in front of a PlayStation, they've announced another much-anticipated remaster: Chrono Cross. Originally released in 1999, the JRPG is coming to PC (and some consoles) as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition with new updated 3D character models, some new 2D art, a "refined" soundtrack, and other tweaky bits. It looks better than many of the garbage PC ports they were releasing a few years ago. Check out the trailer yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 is quite the hardware fiend, hence why enabling DLSS – provided your GPU supports it – is so useful for keeping frame rates up. Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

The unnamed and unannounced game supposedly stars chaotic frenemy Basim, and will be more a smaller stealth-focused game rather than another rambling open-world murder-o-rama. But are we talking stealth-stealth, or Assassin's Creed stealth, or modern Ubisoft stealth?

Thus began America's Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds. Official servers will shut down in May, though offline bits and privately owned servers will remain playable.

Desktop monitors are trying it out as well, like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX: the very first Mini LED gaming monitor on the market when it launched late last year. As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

Tip of the iceberg. You haven’t seen his eagerness, his joie de vivre, as he swings between the many improbably-convenient floating grapple hook platforms of the world. You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab. 


By the end of my seven hours with Grapple Dog, I wanted to strangle the bastard with his own goddamn hook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

It's just as relaxation when the scenery is virtual. SCS Software have just released 20 minutes of the next expansion for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Heart Of Russia, showing the journey from Vyazma to Kaluga.

Instead, you've got two new helpers: the ability to make infinite guesses, and a neural network able to learn word associations telling you how close, conceptually, you are to the correct answer. I've yet to find the solution in fewer than 50 guesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

It's tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you'd think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be Jackie Chan. Not the actual guy, but the version of him in those movies, where he could clear out entire rooms using luck, martial arts and whatever he had within arm’s reach. Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good. It looks at the classics, then the modern descendants of that style, and finally puts its own unique twist on the whole thing.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you're attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, "When the Sakura Bloom", will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

They're sustained by fans' hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it's the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that's making things difficult. You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

He's one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio's classic RPG Nox? That's Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of "best of" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

Today, Tango Gameworks broadcast a 20 minute-long showcase and developer interview that had enough stealth, grapple hooks, and paranormal finger-guns to convince me completely. You can watch the full thing below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The railgun is the best weapon in the Quake series, and so I am excited that it's coming to Risk Of Rain 2. The class-based looter-shooter is getting its first paid DLC, Survivors Of The Void, which adds two new classes - including the Railgunner. You can watch a trailer for the expansion below in preparation of its release on March 1st.

One of those fixes were changes to the game's scoreboard due in late February, but today the development team announced those had slipped into early March instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have played Vampire Survivors twice - that’s two (2) times - in total. In only that short space of time, the arcade-style game has sunk its teeth into me. You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing, I can tell you as a professional, is the most important yet difficult thing anyone has ever done in the world. I am therefore extremely grateful for Narrative Device, a browser-based AI doodad which generates the opening paragraph of a story based on two themes or things you feed into it. Finally, some help for the writers of the world! It's potentially interesting and useful, or at the very least it is fun to make a computer say silly things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is going all in on our favourite finishing moves. This doesn't just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term 'the GG push'. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew's celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.
