After weeks of rumours, Xbox has finally confirmed that it will be bringing more Xbox exclusives to other consoles. What consoles, and what games, is anyone's guess.
During today's Official Xbox Podcast, the Head of Xbox and CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer confirmed that four titles that are currently exclusive to Xbox and PC will be coming to "other consoles". Weirdly, the games haven't been named, and Spencer is leaving it up to the developers behind those games to make the announcements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a lot of rumors, Xbox released a roughly 23-minute podcast in which its heads came together to address the rumors and talk a bit about the future of Xbox. The big takeaway is that four specific, unnamed titles will be coming to other consoles in the future, but Xbox's stance on exclusivity isn't changing otherwise. Oh, and Starfield and Indiana Jones are not one of those four games.




No fundamental changes to exclusitivity


According to Phil Spencer, two of the four games heading to other platforms are community-driven games. The other two are smaller games that were not necessarily built to be console-exclusive in the first place, and so it naturally makes sense to expand onto other platforms.

Xbox president Sarah Bond announced the news in an official Xbox podcast today, with Diablo IV leading the charge on March 28, 2024.


"It's all part of our commitment to make Xbox, the Xbox experience, and the games that we build, as widely available as possible, so now the 34M Game Pass members can all enjoy the fantastic experience of Diablo IV," said Bond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important "updates on the Xbox business." You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are older games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've not yet heard about Synthetik 2 and its predecessor, Synthetik (as featured in our Steam Deck Roguelites recs), we can't blame you, as they're both niche. However, if the idea of a retro-futuristic tactical twin-stick shooter inspired by Robocop tingles, Synthetik 2's Update 14 may be of interest.


Also known as the "Electrify Mega Update," according to the official announcement, Synthetik 2's Update 14 marks a major step forward for the Early Access title. Featuring 20 new usable items, map reworks, substantially improved destruction effects and ragdolls, a new centre HUD option and loads more, Update 14 is a hallmark release for the game. Most importantly, though, Update 14 underlines the game's insistence on tactical and statistical complexity.

Less than a month later, the car progression revamp was outlined, but the studio also noted that it wouldn't be released until Update 6 hits.


In the interim, we just received Forza Motorsport's Update 5, and though it has introduced the long-anticipated Nürburgring Nordschleife track, the simple fact that there's no car progression revamp makes this release feel somewhat deflating. Generally speaking however, the community response to Update 5 is broadly positive, thanks to the new track and some performance improvements.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/15/ea-sports-college-football-25-arrives-this-summer-full-reveal-in-may"/>
        <updated>2024-02-15T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.]]></summary>

Headlining this is a 4% growth of sales, but this growth isn’t due to their PC/Console games, which has actually contracted 5%. Instead, this is largely because of their tabletop games and “Entertainment & Services,” while mobile games also saw a small increase.


However, more grim is their headcount. From March 2023 up to December 2023, their headcount has been reduced by 1,383 or, as the report says, about 8% of the total. These cuts are said to have the objective of “transforming Embracer into a leaner, stronger, more fo…]]></summary>

But Bungie's change of pace doesn't read like its usual exchange for goodwill — something that especially rings true when looking at the state of the studio. 


Bungie is in a historically bad spot. Following an acquisition by Sony, there’s pressure on the studio to perform. As IGN’s Rebekah Valentine previously reported, employees called the atmosphere “soul-crushing” following a round of layoffs and delay for The Final Shape, with both reportedly due to Destiny 2 missing its revenue goals by 45%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those who adore retro fighting and arcade games should check out this month's Capcom Humble Bundle. It provides 70 games, including Street Fighter V: Champion Edition, Final Fight, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Darkstalkers: The Night Walkers, and many more Capcom titles.


For just $20, you'll gain many classic games from Capcom's back catalog and a 34% discount for Street Fighter 6 on the Humble Store. Most of the 70 games derive from the Capcom Arcade Stadium series, which takes old-school arcade gems and ports them to modern systems.

This Capcom Humble Bundle is providing Steam keys for those who buy it. If you just want the 34% Street Fighter 6 discount, you can donate the lowest amount at $2. Part of the proceeds go towards the Children's Miracle Network hospitals, which provide "32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada," according to its description on Humble Bundle.


If you're a Mega Man fan, you can also check out Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters and Mega Man: The Power Battle. Felicia even turns into the blue robot in the whacky Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, which is included.


You should know that the Capcom Humble Bundle runs out on February 29 if you decide to purchase it. Here's everything this bundle includes:



Street Fighter V: Champion Edition


Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection


Ultra Street Fighter IV


Capcom Arcade Stadium


Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium



Those who want to step into the Destiny series should investigate the Destiny 2: The Story So Far bundle. It comes with all the expansion content for $40. 


Since its inception in 2010, Humble Bundle claims it has raised over $253 million for charity. Hopefully, that continues with future bundles.

Notably, the cyborg Automaton faction has mounted its first full-fledged onslaught in Helldivers 2, and it's a wildly different sort of battlefield.


While Helldivers 2's Terminids are a swarm of angry, violent bugs (that can be harvested for fuel, coincidentally), the Automatons are a terrifying army of angry, violent Terminators. Well-organized and properly equipped, Automaton forces are now in the limelight, and the community is coming to terms with the new war front by formulating new tactics and, of course, sharing memes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over ten years since the release of EA Sports' NCAA Football 14. The college football fanbase has been rabid for its reintroduction for years. They'll get their first look at the series' evolution soon. 


The official EA Sports College Football X account updated its profile today to reveal the franchise's new logo. Alongside that, we also got a College Football 25 teaser trailer that announced the game would be fully revealed in May.




We've known since November that EA was targeting this summer for College Football 25's release. However, after previous delays, fans may have been speculative as to whether the college football sim could actually meet its target. Those same fans were playfully called out in today's College Football 25 teaser. "Yeah, it's really happening."


EA's NCAA series was beloved during its run. Many football fans considered the franchise to be superior to its sister series, Madden. Unfortunately, due to complications in college sports around name, image, and likeness, EA shelved it following the release of NCAA Football 14.


The NCAA series was renowned for nailing the authentic atmosphere of college football. The fans, the mascots, the rivalries, the stadiums, all of it faithfully recreated in video game form. The Collge Football 25 teaser trailer seems to hit on all those nostalgic notes, assuring returning fans that this reincarnation will be worth the patience.


With a reveal in May and release in the summer, we won't have to wait much longer to find out.

Company president George Kamitani wasn’t kidding when he teased that the studio’s next project was “one of Vanillaware's biggest productions” last year. The game he was talking about was Unicorn Overlord, a tactical RPG that, on the surface, looks like a homage to the SRPG greats of the ‘90s. Compared to the hugely ambitious sci-fi narrative adventure, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, it feels like the developer is going back to its fantasy roots a bit (Odin Sphere, GrimGrimoire, Dragon’s Crown), and initially, we wondered how a game could be bigger than 2020's twisting, turning adventure.
But, as it turns out, Kamitani-san wasn't messing around. We had a chance to check out Unicorn Overlord courtesy of a remote hands-on event, and after only four hours, we wholly agree with Kamitani’s statement.

Hey, they're talking about me! I haven't played the wide-eyed space game since before the pandemic, partly because I only own the PS4 version and now that I'm RPS news editor, I'm not allowed to touch consoles any more. Seriously, they burn my skin on contact. Anyway, let's have a gander at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.]]></summary>

Declaring your game "the spiritual successor to Freelancer" is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim's dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I'm not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

It’s also the patch I’m having trouble wrapping my head around. One of the features they tout is that Omega enables people to play for free, and in this business, that can mean a lot of things. What is clear is that this isn’t No Man’s Sky going completely free-to-play. So, we can scratch that off.




At the top of the patch notes page, Hello Games notes the update “invites everybody to embark upon a new shared interstellar expedition entirely for free, whether they already own No Man’s Sky or not.” That sounds like there’s a separate mode that is available to play for free as maybe a trial or demo.

Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven't played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "bullet heaven" genre was not something I seriously encountered until I started playing Vampire Survivors. It's got that dopamine hit that comes when you're the one the enemies have to watch out for. But if you want something that's less about castles and spells and more about basic shapes in space, Geometry Survivor is where it's at.


As noted by Gaming on Linux, this is an upcoming rogue-like indie game with the timed, survival notions of something like Vampire Survivors, but with a look that's closer to the old Xbox Live Arcade release Geometry Wars.




In this instance, you take on the role of a "ship," in which you can unlock upgrades so you can fight wave after wave of incoming enemies. It's scheduled to release February 22 on Steam. I've already wishlisted it.


Ooh, it's all bright and colorful!


Here's a quick rundown on what you can expect in Geometry Survivor:



One hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship


Auto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive


Weapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons


Credits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades


Enemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI


20 minutes of intense gameplay


Retro visuals and music straight from the 80s


Delicious gameplay!



I've never considered something that may have "delicious gameplay" before: but I guess all those shapes and vibrant colors do have a tasty quality about them.


Honestly, my girlfriend and I have been hooked on Vampire Survivors, having only really been told about it a few weeks back. Maybe I'm late to the genre, but Geometry Survivor is definitely one that I could be adding to my collection. I'm open to other recommendations, as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To keep the Minecraft juggernaut rolling along, Mojang is getting ready to release version 1.21 of its mighty IP. As part of the said update, the studio is introducing a new mob for when you think the game isn't hostile enough.


Say hello to the bogged. This is a skeletal creature that fires poison-tipped arrows. A recent post on the Minecraft website puts a little bit of a lovey-dovey spin on the mob. Because it was announced on Valentine's Day.




With its green, gooey look and vacant eyes, the bogged is actually a variant on the classic skeleton and, as the name implies, can be found in the more swampy areas of the game.


When can I give it a hug?


The bogged is set to come out with the 1.21 update (which is due sometime this year), but you can test it now in snapshots, which are essentially beta tests for new Minecraft features. The post gives some instructions:



To install a snapshot, open up the Minecraft Launcher and enable snapshots in the "Installations" tab. To enable preview/beta for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, then follow these instructions.




As of late 2023, the game has sold over 300 million copies since it launched in 2011 (or 2009 if you're counting the alpha build). It's no secret that it's been one of the most successful releases in gaming history, and the fact that it's still going today is pretty gnarly stuff.


It's been a good while since I was sucked back into Minecraft's world. Not sure whether a new green enemy is enough to entice me back in. But that could be because I've recently got back into No Man's Sky. That's eating into a lot of my downtime at the minute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the launch of season two and ranked Resurgence in Call of Duty Warzone, the community has had a few complaints. None were more common than the way SR is distributed when players earn kills. Developer Treyarch announced via X (Twitter) on Wednesday that a future update will fix the many issues it received complaints about.


Ranked Warzone kill and assist SR awards are changing


Treyarch announced it will "adjust how Kill and Assist SR is awarded when engaging with downed enemies to mitigate 'tap' gameplay and increase competitive integrity of the SR system." in an upcoming patch. More specifically, this will prevent players from doing little to no work in earning a kill but getting SR for it. Additionally, it will prevent players who do most of the damage to an enemy player from goi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kitchen nightmares.
The biggest challenge facing PlateUp! is the striking similarities to the other culinary stress simulator, Overcooked. Ghost Town Game’s hugely popular series has been fairly unique in its genre up until now. Making sure all orders are right, delivering dishes to tables in time, and washing up after — this rhythm will be familiar to anyone that has experienced the pandemic-era hit.
Such comparisons are more than apt, these titles are similar and both are just as stressful. However, where developer It’s Happening’s PlateUp differs is in the roguelite elements that offer incremental gains as a reward for failure. In addition, a progression system adds a layer of customisation that can make each time you flip the open sign feel fresh.

You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she's becoming more open minded, or just that she's found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don't merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it's a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

Running into this hapless buffoon is always a delight in Cobalt Core, as he's one of the few special characters who doesn't instantly attack you on sight. Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

But here we are, with the survival game exceeding 19 million players and Pocketpair probably wondering how they managed such a feat. With its success has come the inevitable slew of impatient people saying the game's dead because it's not received updates fast enough, or folks saying it's lost a hefty percentage of its player base, and others saying its viewership numbers over on streaming services have plummeted. Palworld's community manager Bucky has gently reminded folks that not only is this discourse "lazy", but to play other games instead.

Do not, for the love of all that's ancient and holy, play this game with its newly-added modern control scheme. The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.

Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I'm very early on in my Helldiver career, and I'm... intrigued by how Arrowhead's efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game's premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

        <updated>2024-02-15T02:55:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path of Exile developer Grinding Gear Games has provided an updated timeline for the release of the PoE expansion. Typically new expansions and leagues have launched about three months apart, but the 3.24 expansion will be a few weeks later than usual and is now planned to launch in late March.




A long Affliction League


Each expansion for Path of Exile brings with it a new league themed around a new mechanic. The current expansion, Path of Exile Affliction, will last longer than usual until the new expansion is released.


This has happened for the last few expansions that have been released for Path of Exile. With Path of Exile 2 hitting beta in a few months, this is certainly understandable. After all, this is probably the last expansion will get before the beta. The two games will now operate separately from each other as standalone titles with their own updates and expansions.


When this has happened recently, Grinding Gear Games has usually run end-of-league events to keep the months-old league fresh and get players excited again ahead of the new expansion. However, the post indicated they are not planning to do that this time around. 


I'm sure some will be disappointed, but honestly, I'm not very interested in participating in end-of-league events after doing so in the last few expansions. The special events were pretty fresh and exciting a few expansions back, but now that they've been happening every expansion I'm a bit burnt out on them. But without coming back, it will be nice to jump into a completely fresh experience with the Path of Exile 3.24 expansion and league.


Path of Exile 3.24 will now be released at the end of March. With previous expansions, Grinding Gear Games has revealed the new expansion about a week before its release.

Version 1.0.1 addresses an issue where the controls could become unresponsive. This same fix has also been applied to the demo version of the game. In addition to this, one other fix resolves an error in one of the listed stage numbers. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news PlayStation Plus members and Call of Duty fans! The latest Combat Pack for Modern Warfare 3 is now available for free if you're a PS+ subscriber. Combat Packs are a nice way to get some extra cosmetic content for your profile, so might as well nab this one for free if you're a member.


What is in Call of Duty MW3 Combat Pack 2?


Understandably, seeing a free downloadable content pack for Call of Duty might immediately make you think the content you receive is bad. However, Combat Pack 2 is undoubtedly worth it. 


The following items come in the new package:



Lockpick operator skin


2 weapon blueprints


Charm


Sticker


Calling card


Emblem



Modern Warfare 3 is discounted on all platforms





In addition to the free content pack, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is also discounted on PS5 and PS4 right now. It's currently available for $48.99, down from $69.99. This discount isn't exclusive to PlayStation Plus members or the PlayStation platform. PC and Xbox players can also buy the franchise's latest installment at a 30% discount for a limited time.


The Vault Edition of the game is also discounted, currently to $79.99, down from $99.99. At a 20% discount, this one adds an operator pack, a tracer weapon blueprint, two weapon vaults, and one season of Blackcell with 30 tier skips for the battle pass. If you're particularly interested in the cosmetics that come with the Vault Edition of the game, it can be quite worth it. 


Buying a Blackcell battle pass with 25 tier skips right now costs $29.99. Doing some quick math shows that with the standard edition of the game at 30% off would be $78.98. So basically you'd get the extra cosmetic packs and five more tier skips for an extra dollar. If fancy cosmetics don't interest you, there's no reason to buy anything but the standard edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month's PlayStation Plus Game Catalog additions were decent. But this month, PlayStation really brought the goods if you're an RPG fan. While the headliner for the month is the newest Need for Speed title, Need for Speed Unbound, the true gems in my opinion are the addition of Tales of Arise, The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

An RPG-loaded Month


Tales of Arise is the latest entry in the Tales series and is an absolute banger of an RPG. Our very own Eric Van Allen scored it an 8.5 when it was released back in 2021, calling it "a strong step forward for a series with a bright future ahead of it." I've still yet to beat it and actually think a friend is still "borrowing" my copy so this is certainly a case for me to get …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is my current go-to high-end gaming CPU recommendation, on account of its brilliant top-tier performance at a mid-tier price. The CPU normally costs around £375, but today it's down to £350 at Amazon UK. This isn't the cheapest we've ever seen this model, but it's the best price recorded in 2024 so far and a solid £25 below the going rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4070 Super is a rather good deal, offering a significant boost in gaming performance over the earlier RTX 4070 - in fact, it's closer to the 4070 Ti than the vanilla 4070. That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day you have been waiting for has arrived. Death Crimson 2: Meranito no Saidan for Dreamcast has finally received a fan translation. It’s time to break out the light guns. If you have one.


I’ll be honest with you, this is the first time I’ve heard of the game, but I am fascinated. Death Crimson 2 is the 1999 sequel to the 1996 Sega Saturn title, Death Crimson. Both games were exclusive to Japan. 


The fan patch is unusually extensive. While most lightgun games could be played without knowing Japanese, Death Crimson 2 features cutscenes and text that tell a narrative. Not only has dialogue text been translated, textures have been redone to correct typos and cutscenes feature translated subtitles. The altered textures not only translate environmental text, but also fix misspellings of English words to better align with the sequel, Crimson Blood OX, which was released in North America.


The team also added an “Extras” menu that features music, videos, and translated fan messages that were posted on the developer’s website.


Death Crimson 2 is a lightgun game, but like many at the time, it can be played by moving a cursor with the joystick. The translation’s Github readme gives some details on compatibility.


As for the game, is it any good? Uh, no. The series is considered kusoge in its homeland, and that poor quality is what earned it a cult fanbase. In fact, in announcing the release of the fan translation, team member Derek Pascarella refers to it as such. However, if I taught you anything, it should be that crappy games are still worthwhile. For that matter, I typically play House of the Dead 2 simply to hear its abysmal voice acting.


The fan translation of Death Crimson 2: Meranito no Saidan is available on Pascarella’s Github page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[February 14 arrives every year in a shower of roses, chocolates, and stacks of overpriced cards, but this year Palworld players have turned to the DIY approach in order to incorporate game-based puns into the yearly celebration of love. 


Players across social media have been sharing their fan art, physical art, and gifts received from loved ones in what’s been dubbed “Palentines Day”. I’ve scoured both Reddit and Twitter to gather some of the best, so here's just a small sampling of the gems I'd gladly pass around to friends and loved ones. 


By far the most popular post on Twitter comes from the @PalworldUpdates page. Although not affiliated with Pocket Pair in any way, the Palworld Updates page has quickly become a go-to page for news and information since release. Let's kick off this list of posts with their contribution to Palentines, featuring none other than the adorable Ice type pal, Chillet.




Also on Twitter, @Jemini_Jem has shared not one but six different Palworld-inspired Palentines, including this gem featuring Depresso.




There's, of course, the anxious lover always posing ridiculous "what if" scenarios, too. Keeping with the trend, @sinillus made this "Would you still love me if I was a worm?" addition for the Palentines pool. That question seems a little more plausible in this world. 




One player has taken things to a whole new level, crafting this Elphidran plush that I now desperately need in my life. 




We all need someone in our lives who can embrace our enjoyment of video games, and this player has apparently hit the jackpot. Commenters have urged them to upgrade her partner status to wife, understandably.




Users in the official Palworld Discord server have been submitting Valentines-themed fan art for the competition, which is currently running, and this user shared their adorable submission on Reddit, too.

With the community lamenting disconnection issues, no doubt plenty are getting tired of the messy break-ups. Hopefully, today's stability patch touches the hearts of all Helldivers 2 players.


It's no secret that Helldivers 2 players have been having a, ahem, hell of a time finding matches and staying connected. Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has responded to the concerns, explaining the unusual situation while rolling out fixes and server updates. Indeed, being too successful can be its own burden. Patch 01.000.006, which rolled out today, further optimizes the game.

"Regarding the PS5 hardware, which will enter its fifth year since launch, partially due to its entering the latter half of the console cycle, we aim to optimize sales with a greater emphasis on the balance with profits, so we anticipate a gradual decline in unit sales from next fiscal year onwards," reads the relevant section from Sony's financials.


The report doesn’t elaborate on that statement. Sony doesn’t state that they are working on their next-generation console or an upgraded “Pro” model of the console. They also don’t define how “latter” is “latter,” whether they’re looking to end its lifespan next year or three …]]></summary>

If you've been finding platformers to be a bit on the, shall we say, chill side, then you might want to keep an eye on Krimson, launching on the Switch eShop on 21 March, 2024.
Described as a 'gritty, heart-pounding journey through a nightmarish hellscape', Krimson sees you navigate a series of frankly ridiculous environments that pulse and move in time with the music. You must keep in time with the beat if you're to survive, but judging from the trailer, you'll also need sharp eyes to keep track of everything that's going on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been enjoying the Apple Arcade-exclusive Sonic Dream Team, you'll have more to dig into later today. SEGA has the first content update scheduled to go live at 2:00 pm PT. 


From the looks of it, there's a little something for those who want more from the bosses and folks who are striving to go even faster. For the former, the update adds eight new boss missions, as well as overhauls to some of the key boss fights. 


Enemies like Dr. Crabulous, the Factory Foremen, and the Guardian Hunter have all been tweaked to shake things up a bit. According to the announcement, this includes the addition of "a few new moves to keep players on their toes during battle."


If going fast is your thing — and why wouldn't it be, you're not playing a Big the Cat platformer! — the update introduces time trials and some handy tools for speedrunners. Taking part in time trials will give you a shot at nabbing the best completion time in each Act. The results will be available on the leaderboard once recorded so you can go back to try to best yourself or everyone else, depending on how competitive you're feeling. For speedrunners, the Sonic Dream Team update adds ranks for each Act.

Sonic Dream Team first launched on December 5, 2023, taking a swerve from the recent 2D sidescroller Sonic Superstars to deliver 3D platforming exclusive to Apple devices. Those who subscribe to Apple Arcade can give it a spin on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, and there's more on the way at some point in the future. Sega reiterated that this is the first of three content updates, with other additions planned for sometime in 2024.

Why are snipers banned in Modern Warfare 3 ranked play?


When it comes to Call of Duty, and it doesn't matter which version we're talking about, the developers can't seem to please everyone. Snipers were banned from the Call of Duty League and ranked multiplayer playlists, and everyone complained. Then snipers were allowed in both, and players still complained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since being released, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fans have reported some not-so-pretty visuals when switching to Performance Mode in the newly released demo. Thankfully, it looks like some upgrades are on the way as Square Enix plans to apply some improvements to the visual quality of Performance Mode in an update rolling out on February 21.




For the most part, Performance Mode is always going to pale in comparison graphically to Quality Mode. After all, that's the intent: to shed some visual quality in an effort to maintain a stable framerate, often 60 fps. However, in the FF7 Rebirth demo it felt like the quality slider went a few notches too far.


Square Enix's post on Twitter about the upcoming update didn't go into much detail, but it did state the improvements are also being applied to the full game when it releases in two weeks. (Yep that's right, just two more weeks to go!) With the update coming in a week, that will give players roughly eight days to play through the graphically improved demo before Rebirth's full release.


I personally played through the demo the first time in Quality Mode, which looked great. After hearing about the issues people were having I booted it back up in Performance Mode and have to agree, there are definitely some improvements to be made so I'm happy to see Square Enix making them.


The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo is available now on PlayStation 5. The full release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is on February 29.

The Fantastic Four was first announced in 2019 and is scheduled to premiere next year as the second film in Phase Six of the MCU. In a sweet Valentine's Day message, Marvel announced the following actors will portray Marvel’s First Family: 
Happy Valentine’s Day from Marvel’s First Family! Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn are The Fantastic Four.

Sue Storm/Invisible Woman - Vanessa Kirby (Napoleon, The Crown) 
Johnny Storm/Human Torch - Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, Overlord)
Ben Grimm/The Thing - Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear, The Punisher)
Pedro Pascal has been on a roll lately, starring as Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, portraying the titular Mandalorian in The Mandalorian, and starring in films such as The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and the upcoming Gladiator 2. Vanessa Kirby made her name portraying Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, most recently played Joséphine in Ridley Scott's historical epic Napoleon, and has appeared in the recent Mission: Impossible films as Alanna. Stranger Things season 4 fans know Joesph Quinn best as the season's breakout character, Eddie Munson. Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been known as Richard "Richie" Jerimovich in the FX series The Bear and as Arvel Skeen in the Star Wars series Andor. 
WandaVision director Matt Shakman will direct The Fantastic Four, though its story details remain scarce. The Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not always an easy decision when trying to choose a new graphics card. Nvidia alone recently launched three new SUPER models (not those kind) in its 4000 series. But if you want a GPU that sort of reminds you of what it was like to help your dad with household renovations, this could be right up your street.


As spotted by Videocardz, Sycom has launched an Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER. As well as mixing fans with liquid coolers, the cards come with spirit levels built onto the hardware itself. You know, those bubble-levels you use to make sure everything's even-keel.


Image via Videocardz/Sycom.


And I said spirit levels...because there are two of them. Presumably added on for more accurate installation, they do seem to look quite at home, particularly on the green version.


Nope, can't think of a spirit-based pun in this context


There is one downside to this, which is it looks as though these spirit level Nvidia GPUs are only available as part of a complete package. The website shows them as part of the Sycom G-Master Hydro series, which means you'd have to buy a full system to get one.


It seems more of a novelty feature than anything, unless there are those who absolutely want to ensure precise installation. The obvious main advantage to a graphics card like this is the liquid cooling, which is said to reduce temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celcius.


With the RTX 4080 SUPER running at a TDP of 320W, those extra degrees could come in handy. But, again, it shows that the graphics hardware market is something of a minefield when it comes to choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For prospective Destiny 2 players looking to pick up the game before The Final Shape releases, now's your chance. Humble Bundle is offering a bundle called Destiny 2: The Story So Far, and it includes every expansion plus a few extras for $40. 


Player onboarding has been a sticking point for the Destiny 2 community for quite some time. While the game is technically free-to-play, that experience is limited to a few activities and some locales to patrol. The ongoing narrative and the bulk of Destiny 2 content are behind expansion and season paywalls, naturally making it a nightmare for new players to navigate.


If players opt for the $40 tier of the bundle, they'll get access to all of the playable content currently in the game. That includes: 



Shadowkeep 


Beyond Light


The Witch Queen


Lightfall


Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack


Forsaken Pack


Lightfall Dungeon Key


Annual pass for Lightfall containing access to all Seasons 20-23 content



This removes the potential confusion of a first-time player trying to decipher which store listings contain actual content versus cosmetic items or premium currency. On top of that, Lightfall alone is usually sold for $50. The savings speak for themselves.


The cool thing is that the bundle has different tiers, too. If players don't care about Lightfall Dungeon or seasonal content, a $20 tier offers just the listed expansions. At $12, it's the everything preceding Lightfall. And at a measly $8, players still get a full expansion and some of the oldest Destiny 2 content still in the game, Shadowkeep and the Forsaken Pack.


As a bonus, purchasers can know that at least some portion of their funds will go to charity. For Destiny 2: The Story So Far, part of the money goes to The Bungie Foundation.

It sounds like a win on paper, essentially giving us dedicated grinders a guaranteed Uber Unique after a certain number of runs. It is, but there’s still a huge asterisk to this system introduced in 1.3.2.

Teething issues are part of the agreement when you sign on to play something in its experimental state, and players, for the most part, have been pretty forgiving and patient as they wait for fixes. However, the Palworld subreddit has recently become a hotbed of complaints, highlighting issues that render the game almost impossible to play and even more impossible to enjoy. 




One bug appears to be affecting Xbox players in particular and renders Duneshelter entirely unusable. As soon as players arrive at the fast travel …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creator of Suikoden and Eiyuden Chronicles, Yoshitaka Murayama, died on February 6 due to “complications with an ongoing illness,” as announced by his company, Rabbit and Bear Studios.


Murayama joined Konami back in 1992 and worked his way up to direct and write his own game, Suikoden, which was released at the end of 1995 in Japan before reaching North America in 1996. He continued working on the series through to 2002, when he left Konami a month before the release of Suikoden III. He formed Blue Moon Studios, where he worked on 2005’s 10,000 Bullets.


Recently, he was head of Rabbit and Bear Studios and was working on Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, which is set to release April 23, 2024.


The statement from Rabbit and Bear studios reads, “His hard work on Eiyuden Chronicle as scenario writer was finished but as his co-workers and friends, it saddens us to know that he won’t get to see the reactions from his fans.”


A remaster compilation for the first two games in the Suikoden series, Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, is also likely to be released this year. It’s heartbreaking that he won’t be here for the release of his follow-up and the celebration of the games he helped build. We at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.

The strikers are calling it a "badly balanced rewards system". Cheeky devils!
The news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The web-heads at Insomniac Games must be celebrating, as Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 sales have reached over 10 million copies as of February 4, 2024. The news was provided to us by Sony, who just released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter. 


“Today, we're honored to celebrate an amazing milestone: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has surpassed 10 million units sold, bringing the game series sales to an astounding 50 million units!” said Insomniac Games on Twitter. “Thank you for the support and making this spectacular journey possible!”

It’s “amazing” that with just three games in the series, 50 million units have been sold.  PlayStation’s purchase of the talented studio Insomniac Games for $229 million seems to be a slam dunk with these Marvel's Spider-Man 2 sales numbers.


Those who picked up the sequel might be happy to know there’s a big title update coming March 7. It will include New Game+, new suits to play in, and more. No other details are out yet.


The news of the game reaching 10 million units is no doubt a good win, after the trouble caused by the Insomniac Games hack late last year. Upcoming plans, development videos, and personal data were all shared from a ransom attack. Hopefully this success can help ease any lingering hurt from that.


Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 released back on October 20, 2023. Destructoid gave it a 9/10 review. “It’s abundantly clear that this series isn’t over yet, and I hope that Insomniac never really stops working on superhero games,” said our review. “There’s so much of the Spider-Man mythos that’s untapped so far, and you could keep this gravy train running with some crazier ideas once this presumed trilogy is over.”

As we await for official word from Microsoft's Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Matt Booty on what the future of Xbox will look like going forward, a cheeky social media post from the official Sea of Thieves account appears to be heavily hinting toward a multi-platform release.
Posted a day before Xbox's big 'business update', during which it's rumoured that Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush will be announced for Switch (with potentially a few more titles too), the account seems to be blatantly referencing Xbox's major platform competitors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to co-op shooters and most other multiplayer games, it's often the case that friendly fire is switched off by default or there are endless systems in place to make it a punishable offence. In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

He finds himself thrown in the middle of a conflict between the islands’ residents and a seafaring tribe, as well as mysterious immortal monsters called the Griegers. Adol joins a Norman warrior named Karja to sail the seas aboard a ship, including exploring an open ocean and engaging in naval combat. 


Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game's classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo's 2024.
In the game's opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[February's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza officially concluded on Monday, and Valve have now revealed the 50 most played games you all tucked into across the week-long event. Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven't been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year's Next Festers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a delicious piece of mad science: what if you spliced the ale-sodden DNA of Deep Rock Galactic’s dwarven miners with tissue samples from a Vampire Survivors-like autoshooter?
It shouldn’t work, surely. It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you'll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games' upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

Over the past week the devs have deployed server hotfixes and matchmaking tweaks, although one server and rewards patch had to be rolled back to fix "significant" performance issues. Still, they're doing their utmost as the game becomes PlayStation's biggest PC release to date. And the latest patch brings with it a slew of crash fixes, reductions to disconnects, further tweaks to matchmaking, and preps things for future server improvements.

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. 


Oh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there! I'm supposed to be telling you about Terra Memoria, a new RPG featuring time travel, magic crystals and animal wizards. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that's centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn't on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment).

Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

The issue of course, is that in real life, if forced to live in a space the size of the interior of a camper van, I would pile things on every surface within about 12 hours. Chaos would reign. I would hate it. But I don't hate the idea of it, which is why i enjoy things like Outbound, which is a game about living in a camper van.

Wolves have broken into your home and murdered all your friends, but you play as the one sheep who got away - or rather, a sheep that's been fused with a surprisingly powerful robot capable of producing a honking great greatsword to make their escape with.

One example is the Kingston NV2, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD going for just £50 on Amazon UK at the moment - some £14 below its UK RRP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the "where" and "when": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

February 12, 2024
The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.
The other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced "gaslamp fantasy" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go." And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Banishers took a while to kick in," I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, "but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night." It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don't Nod's ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for "grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.
Banishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace "treasure" with "ghosts".

They're a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin', tootin' cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game's wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.
Marie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. "Procgen" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a "hand-made" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. 


One is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of "Fae" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.

Made by a former Arkane level designer, it's about a train maintenance job at a border post atop the world's tallest mountain, where the air is so thin you need to huff top-ups from cans. Concrete information on Threshold is a bit thin at this point but I can tell you that you have a bucket and some planks, so what more do you need to know? Check out the announcement trailer, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there have been efforts by AMD over the years to make it easier to port codebases targeting NVIDIA's CUDA API to run atop HIP/ROCm, it still requires work on the part of developers. The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this "skunkworks" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.]]></summary>

Why is this of interest to us, a PC gaming site? Well, because console gaming can't help but shape the weather for PC gaming; more specifically, Microsoft's alleged multiplatform ambitions seem to reflect the plateauing of Game Pass subscription growth, which has become the cornerstone of the Xbox biz.

Not only is it one of the most visually vibrant games of the year so far with its neon colour palette that's an instant-KO-to-my-eyeballs, but the way it twists and rewires core tenets of the Metroidvania rulebook also make it one of the boldest and most daring examples of its genre. I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the recent Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Hideo Kojima's iconic tactical espionage action franchise has been on our minds. And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you're spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. 
Sure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it's never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line.

That's also how we know that the council inexplicably approved a pirate IPTV scheme for residents and local businesses, that would unwittingly render itself an illegal subscription reseller set to profit from them all.

While the series has some entries that are stronger than others, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortable with.
In 2018, we ranked the top 300 games of all time in our 300th issue. While that list was more about ranking games in terms of quality, importance to the industry, and cultural relevance, this list is just about our favorite games. So check out our rankings of the 22 core Super Mario games below!

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. 
But one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is "probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that." Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.
Some games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of "living, breathing" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, "gardenvania" - which launches next week.

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

The answer is apparently "be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.
You know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First spotted when James and Liam (RPS in peace) covered the PC Gaming Show 2023, Mullet Mad Jack is a roguelike FPS with a Steam Next Fest demo out right now. And my goodness me, it rules. The retro anime aesthetic is cool, sure, but I particularly love its setup, which forces you to blast through corridors as fast as you possibly can. Yeah, this is extremely a bit of Edders, and it's gone straight on the wishlist.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects
you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has had a rough road following the early success of the first game. That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Baldur's Gate 3 is a double-edged sword for other CRPGs launching in its wake. On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own "repercussions", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from "literally about 3 ever made" to "does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense "survive the ordeal" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.
But it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In survival games, I leave the building to everyone else, or I build the absolute bare minimum unless I really enjoy the world I'm in. I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.
But I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, "water" and "fire" combine to make "steam", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable. More games should facilitate haphazard engineering and silliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've long been enamoured with the landscape of the Pacific Northwest, from the Douglas firs and waterfalls of Twin Peaks to the redwoods I once swam beneath on a road trip. Thanks to Pacific Drive's Steam Next Fest demo, I have now also barrelled through the woods and backroads of a spooky alt-history PNW in a banged-up car which is itself a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-esque artifact. I've had my eye on Pacific Drive for a few years and after playing the demo, I am delighted by parts of it but not entirely sold on its roguelikelike survival scavenge-o-rama structure. Hmm! Give it a go and tell me what you think.

Though movie magic you will never know the difference, except I just told you. Oh no! Anyway, with the Steam Next Fest ongoing, I noticed an uptick in games and demos for games that are just about making a nice diorama, and have no goals or real restrictions. Interesting! I ask my co-hosts why they think this is, if that even makes a game a game, is making your own play less fun if you're not breaking someone else's rules, and so on.

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.
Persona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

Toufexis also shared a few parting speculations about the unannounced Deus Ex sequel from Eidos Montreal that was reported cancelled last week. Toufexis wasn't involved with this one, and according to him, it likely wasn't a continuation of Jensen's story from Mankind Divided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

Inkulinati, a turn-based strategy game where you play a medieval artist duking it out with another artist on the pages of an illuminated manuscript, is one such. It's been kicking about on Steam since at least 2019, and in fairness to me it did launch in January last year - it just went into early access. These factors contributed to me being sort of surprised at the reveal of the actual release date for 1.0, which is February 22nd.

The associated joint statement from developers Blackbird Interactive and publishers Gearbox arrived within hours of me posting about said Homeworld 3 demo and saying that while I am fully onboard with many aspects of the new space strategy game, I do have reservations about its controls. 


Naturally, and self-flatteringly, I'm now petrified that I'm single-handedly responsible for the delay. Please come back, Homeworld 3! I didn't mean it! I'm pretty sure I'll acclimatise to the control scheme with practice! True-3D starfleet management is always a bit fiddly! Besides which, I might not get to review it now!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's PlayStation State of Play, Square Enix gave us new details for what to expect when Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives later this month. The game continues to impress with each passing look, earning its spot as the "Most Anticipated Game" at The Game Awards 2023.
The world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is broken into various regions, which seamlessly blend into one another. After the intro sequence, players enter into the Grasslands, a grassy area south of Midgar. From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra's military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides. The game also includes Corel, which features the touristy beach town of Costa del Sol, the massive playground known as Gold Saucer, and the dusty portion of the region to…]]></summary>

It's no secret that I've spent a lot of time playing, seeing, talking about, and writing about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix's Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue's cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table. However, after coming out of the hours-long gameplay session and another conversation with director Naoki Hamag…]]></summary>

During today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven't yet witnessed and characters we've seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth's quest for the Black Materia and the party's efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it's all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.
You can check out this cinematic trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2022, Paramount+ finally released the first season of Halo, the long-awaited live-action adaptation of the popular video game franchise. While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.
According to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …]]></summary>

It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. 
It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for Game Informer (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.
There is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.

If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 
Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 
Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 


All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.
