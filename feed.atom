In part that’s because the studios make free ones that are really, really good. But it’s also because deep-pocketed companies like Epic keep giving away even the paid ones.

Originally announced in 2016 for an early 2017 release under Steam's now-defunct Greenlight program, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Blazing Strike was canceled. However, after years of fine-tuning the gameplay, seeking different methods of funding the project, and undergoing a full visual overhaul, Blazing Strike is finally poised to launch in 2022.

The video at the top is from the channel scottbez1, which gives a nice overview of how a functional mini Switch decoration was put together. It's very clever indeed, with a range of components powering a tiny LCD, all housed within a 3D-printed shell.

Two Tribes is a name that's likely familiar to eShop enthusiasts, in particular from the 3DS and Wii U era. Well known for its original Toki Tori, which recently had a re-release of the Game Boy Color original through Limited Run games, on the Wii U and 3DS the company developed and published a range of excellent games, like EDGE, RUSH, Toki Tori 2+ and RIVE.

You can read the full details and access the files on Github, which includes plenty of information to help prospective programmers get started. In terms of Nintendo releases that utilised the engine, Toki Tori 2+ and RIVE are good examples on Wii U and more recently through their Switch ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards have been breaking their own records year-over-year and the 2021 show was no different. 
Last year, The Game Awards 2020 broke records with over 83 million viewers, and this year, the show had an estimated 85 million tune in by way of “global livestreams.” Like previous award shows, this year’s event was livestreamed across more than 30 digital networks around the world such as YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. 
“On Twitter, The Game Awards delivered a record-setting 1.6 million tweets about the event in 2021, its best-ever performance,” a press release reads. “The show trended #1 worldwide for the 8th year in a row, commanding 11 out of the top 30 worldwide trends at the peak of conversation.” 
Over on YouTube, a new record for watch time was made with over 1.75 million hours watched on the main Game Awards stream, which does not include co-streams. That’s up 14% compared to last year’s show. Year-over-year, fan voting increased 27% to more than 23.2 million votes. 
“We are grateful we could return to an in-person ceremony in 2021 and continue to build on our success with significant international growth in 2021,” The Game Awards producer and host, Geoff Keighley, said. 
For more context about this year’s record-breaking 85 million livestream numbers, here’s a look at the numbers for previous years: 
2021: 85 million
2020: 83 million
2019: 45.2 million
2018: 26.2 million
2017: 11.5 million
2016: 3.8 million
2015: 2.3 million
2014: 1.9 million
If you weren’t one of the 85 million livestreams, don’t worry – here’s Game Informer’s list of every winner from The Game Awards 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bait-and-Switch.
Not so long ago, we reported on the Up-Switch Orion, a crowdfunded accessory that promised to make up for the "underwhelming" and "minuscule" Nintendo Switch screen (Up-Switch's words, not ours). "By increasing your actual gaming screen size by 188% and upgrading your audio experience with the integrated stereo speakers, your Nintendo Switch combined with ORION will deliver the gaming experience that every gamer deserves!"
The pitch was clearly convincing because more than $165,000 was raised, totally blasting past the $50,000 funding goal. Shortly after we ran our news story, we were sent one of these $299 devices free of charge to test out, but sadly, the final product is a bit of a disappointment.

Photo modes are so hot these days! But, well, not so much on Switch. Search "Best Photo Modes" and you'll get a bevy of PlayStation and Xbox games, probably — like The Last of Us, God of War, or Death Stranding. And sure, those games are lovely and pretty and photorealistic... But you don't need a fancy 4K game console to take good photos, and besides — Nintendo basically invented taking photos in games, didn't they!
To prove that the Switch can hold its own when it comes to photography, we've put together the best games that either have brilliant photo modes, or are actually about photography, right here on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mass Effect 2's final moments carry the potential for death. Commander Shepard is tasked to lead a team on a suicide mission, and the choices made during it could lead to a beloved teammate losing their life. This mission can be completed without any losses (a strategy we detail in a handy flowchart), but most players lose one or two characters two during their first playthrough.
Many of you took on this mission for the first time in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Following the game's release, Electronic Arts and BioWare collected player data from this mission and have revealed the survival rate for each squad member.  This info is a small part of Electronic Arts' extensive, numbers-filled year-in-review.
As the numbers show, the fan-favorite Garrus often lived to see another day, making it through the suicide mission in 98 percent of players' attempts. The loveable singer Mordin died the most, surviving in just 90 percent of players' games. You can see all of the survival rates in the image below:
Electronic Arts' also revealed the most liked squadmates from the Legendary Edition, and they are not who you would think. Garrus is third on that list, trailing Kaidan and Ashley, as one and two. A quarter of players also apparently didn't have the time to change the name of their Commander Shepard, which defaults to John/Jane. The numbers show 23 percent of players played the game under one of these names.
If you still haven't played through the Mass Effect trilogy, there's no better way to do it than through Legendary Edition. Kimberley Wallace gave this collection a review score of 9 out of 10, and said: "Even all these years later, Commander Shepard is a powerful force that lives up to their iconic status, and the trilogy is still captivating and worth your time."]]></summary>

Connoisseurs of both gaming and rap music will no doubt be aware of Rap Quest, an ill-fated Game Boy title with the working title 'Rap City' that originally featured '90s rapper Vanilla Ice before rights issues meant his music couldn't be used. As we've reported before, Equilibrium Software completed work on the game and submitted it to Nintendo, although it was never released.
Fast forward past the Nintendo 'gigaleaks' of 2020/21 — when a host of historical internal Nintendo-related development material leaked onto the internet and the pre-release lot check Rap Quest ROM found its way online — and anyone with an internet connection and the means to write to a blank Game Boy cart can play the game in glorious pixel-perfect upscaled fidelity on one of those lovely new Analogue Pockets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the midst of its initial open beta, DNF Duel received another trailer, showing off its eleventh confirmed character and announcing its intended release window of summer 2022 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
Ghostblade will be joining the cast when the game releases next year, making him the second male Slayer class from Dungeon Fighter Online to be included. He wields a katana for a weapon, but more importantly, he has a spooky ghost living in his arm, making the appendage glow with a spectral blue hue. The trailer shows off Ghostblade's intro cinematic and a tease of what his Awakening attack can do. Here's a hint: a ghost and a blade are involved, and it looks fantastic.

Eagle-eyed fans who watched the trailer's debut during yesterday's DNF Winter Fest have spotted a couple of new roster members in the new footage, which didn't make it to the official trailer release. One shot revealed Ghostblade attacking the unannounced Mechanic, while another has people thinking they saw the Troubleshooter Agent variant, though that one is more speculative. Either way, I'm excited to see how both of them play if they are added, considering how varied and fun the rest of the cast is. 
While the trailer above doesn't have that footage attached, you can check out the images over on Event Hubs' story. But watch the video anyway to see some cool characters doing neat moves and get hyped for whenever we'll be able to get our hands on DNF Duel again. 
Did you get a chance to try out DNF Duel this weekend? What did you think of the game so far? Which other Dungeon Fighter Online classes would you like to see come to Duel? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s no single, solitary reason why it’s been so hard to buy certain PC components over the past year and a bit – it’s more like a perfect storm of multiple circumstances, unfortunate coincidences and unforseen annoyances. That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

Willing to die once again rather than betray his revolutionary allies. But it just kept going wrong for reasons that felt utterly artificial and sometimes deeply dissatisfying.
I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.

With 20 years behind it, a beloved movie that many still regard as an all-time high for fantasy storytelling in cinema, I figured it'd be fun to take a look at what 2001 looked like when "The Fellowship of the Ring" hit theaters. What consoles were we all playing? What were the most significant games that year?

The Switch may be approaching its 5th Birthday, but it's still the best-selling game console on the market at present; there'll no doubt be a lot of new owners and systems going online this Holiday season, too. When that happens, of course, we can often see some server issues that can impact eShop access and account creation.
Nintendo is eager to warn new Switch owners, we suspect especially parents giving them to children, to set it up ahead of the big day. Nintendo's Japanese customer service account has put the word out (thanks, Siliconera), and we suspect regional accounts will promote a similar message in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the heels of the release of The Witcher Season 2 on Netflix, the subscription streaming company has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming prequel to the show, The Witcher: Blood Origin. 
As previously announced by Netflix, this prequel show takes place in the same world as The Witcher Continent that Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia inhabits, but it’s more focused on the elven side of things. The trailer features plenty of Michelle Yeoh’s Scian, as well as new looks at Sophia Brown’s Élle, Jacob Collins-Levy’s Eredin, and more. This is just a taste of who we’ll be seeing in the six-episode prequel when it hits sometime in 2022.

“Witness the untold history of the Continent with The Witcher: Blood Origin, a new prequel series set in an elven world 1200 years before the events of The Witcher,” a tweet from the official Witcher account reads. “The Witcher prequel series Blood Origin will dive into the events that lead to the pivotal ‘Conjuction of the Spheres,’ when the worlds of monsters, men, and elves collided.” 
As you can see in the trailer, there’s no Geralt to be found in this series. However, as Netflix notes, Blood Origin is about the Conjuction of the Spheres, which paves the way for Geralt’s story on the Continent 1200 years later. 
While waiting for Blood Origin, check out Season 2 of The Witcher, which just hit Netflix on Friday. Read about how The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is getting DLC inspired by the Netflix TV series after that and then check out Game Informer’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review.

Shin Megami Tensei V was a notable Switch exclusive in November; we enjoyed it in our review and the user review score is also currently flying high on this site. The RPG had been eagerly anticipated and seems to have delivered a sizeable, engaging game that was also a top performer for the franchise at launch in the US, for example.
Digital Foundry has now taken a look at it, assessing its general design and of course all of the technical details you'd expect of the channel. There's praise for some of the visual aspects, with the game running on Unreal Engine 4, but performance is certainly an issue as it seems to rarely hit a stable 30fps.

Nevertheless, PS Plus subscribers who redeemed the vanilla Remake through the Sony-owned game service will get a free Intergrade upgrade. What’s more, the Yuffie Intermission DLC is available at a discounted price for a limited time.

The F-Zero series is currently in extended hibernation, and we've not seen a fresh entry in the franchise for almost 20 years. While the idea of playing the game on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum might not be exactly what fans are wishing for, it has happened – thanks to the talents of a small homebrew dev by the name of Voxel Tower.
Space Racing naturally has no official blessing from Nintendo itself, but it does a remarkable impression of F-Zero running on the classic British home computer. It uses many of the same ships from the series, and also includes artwork that is lifted directly from F-Zero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deed-lightful.
Team Ladybug has something of a reputation of turning famous licensed properties into compelling Metroidvanias. After the opening PC-exclusive freebie Shin Megami Tensei: Synchronicity Prologue starring series mascot Jack Frost came Touhou Luna Nights, another ‘exploration action’ title featuring the endlessly popular Gensokyo gang. The team's follow-up to that is the lovely-looking Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. Based on the novels/anime/manga/audio dramas/games of the same name. Helpfully for a game based on something that was mildly popular in the West 30 years ago, prior knowledge of titular heroine Deedlit’s high fantasy adventures isn’t required to enjoy the story here, with her generally learning things alongside the player and everything else either revealed with time or easily summed up as ‘someone/thing she used to know’.
More immediately recognisable than Deedlit's past acquaintances are Wonder Labyrinth’s gaming influences. The spectacularly animated and cloaked 2D protagonist — sword in hand, double-jumping over gaps and smacking suspicious walls until they crumble — makes the game feel more Castlevania: Symphony of the Night than some of that trendsetting game’s own sequels. Unlike many other pretenders to Alucard’s crown, Team Ladybug’s latest effort is happy to see Konami’s classic as a springboard for its own ideas rather than something to be slavishly copied, and so for every expected feature (enemies dropping equippable weapons, warp rooms, and so on) there’ll be a major new mechanic to balance it out.

This news comes by way of Serebii.net, which reported that the mystery gift event is now live for all players. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer something like the shiny Zacia and Zamazenta recently distributed via Mystery Gift in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Instead of an actual Pokémon, this event is giving players some statues for their secret bases. 
Click here to watch embedded media


More specifically, the Mystery Gift code, MERRYCHR1STMAS, will give all players a jade-colored statue of Pacharisu, Lucario, Rhyperior, Electivire, and Glaceon. The smaller statues such as that of Pacharisu and Glaceon are quite cute, but if you’re looking for something more intimidating for your base, the Rhyperior and Electivire statues have you covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Three new, experimental and winter themed levels" coming soon.
Earlier in the year, Toree 3D was an utterly unexpected gem on Switch that we discovered by chance. A low-poly platformer with a PS1/Sega Saturn visual style, its breeziness and super-budget price were a breath of fresh air, with cheep (heh) and cheerful — but incredibly satisfying — gameplay that puts many a full-priced 3D platformer to shame.
A similarly super sequel, Toree 2, arrived back in October (indeed, it featured in the Nintendo Life Indie Spotlight) and developer Siactro has announced that a free update which includes a trio of new winter-themed levels is coming on Wednesday 22nd December at 10am PST.

Slowly and surely, especially after a huge increase in attention in 2020, gaming is getting more attention in mainstream culture. In terms of sales and profits gaming has been at the forefront for many years, but the battle for acknowledgement as an artform has been a little slower, albeit the medium is starting to get similar critical attention as film, TV and literature.
The latest example came out of the 2021 Hugo Awards, which were hosted at 'Discon III' in Washington DC over the weekend. A new game award was a one-off for that event, as The Hugo Awards typically focuses on science fiction and fantasy works; its origins were in literary works, but over recent years the awards have been gradually expanded and added additional categories.

With its monochrome display and doorbell-style sound, the Game Boy could hardly have been described as cutting edge even back in 1989, so the idea of bringing it up to speed with WiFi connectivity sounds like the stuff of a madman's dreams – but that's exactly what hacker Sebastian Staacks has done.
Using his technological know-how and plenty of cool programming tricks, Staacks has created a special cartridge that bestows Nintendo's classic handheld with the ability to browse the internet (well, Wikipedia, at least) wirelessly.

UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 18th December, showcasing an Indie hit with a strong physical debut and a whole lot of the usual suspects.

Typically £3.89 on the eShop with relatively frequent (albeit modest) discounts, this physical version costs £27.99 but does have some rather nice physical and digital goodies included. It was released on multiple platforms, with Switch being the best performer with 39% of sales; for developer Innersloth and distributer Maximum Games it's an impressive achievement to break into the top 10.

Normally $39.99USD / €39,99 / £34.99, it's currently $2.79USD / €2,79 / £2.44, which for a sizeable open world game is rather bonkers. We've had multiple readers so befuddled by the discount that they assumed it to be some sort of mistake or glitch, but it's just a big 'ol official discount. It's got another 10 days to run at the time of writing, which ties into the promotional window for a lot of titles that were in the official Holiday discounts that launched last week in Europe (this price cut is also in North America).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day!

Martin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls series right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.
Elden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline shooter entries up to Halo Infinite, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Halo: Combat Evolved.  
Developed by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved was positioned as the launch title for Microsoft's promising but unproven Xbox. Released on November 15, 2001, Halo redefined the first-person shooter and immediately solidified the Xbox as a must-own console. It's tough to imagine what Microsoft's place in the game industry would be today without Halo's success. Bungie became a household name, but the studio existed long before Halo and struggled financially prior to its launch. Twists and turns such as axing Halo's original PC exclusivity and going through bizarre working titles such as The Santa Machine are just some of the fascinating topics we'll unpack in this week's episode. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's video game debut.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can't get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that's not all it has to offer. We've compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.
Sony doesn't seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it's far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There's a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.
Here are Game Informer's picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That's Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We're talking about the OG! It's been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.
While its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur's Gate titles. You'll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios' rendition of the Forgotten Realms. 
This updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you're in luck. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too. 
And now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer's game with a similar name.
Have you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!]]></summary>

It's not easy to release a kart racer in a world where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell gangbusters on Switch, but alas, Nexon is bucking the trend and not only releasing their own kart racer, but it's a free-to-play game, too. And it's a fun time! 
Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc recently went hands-on with KartRider: Drift during the closed beta that ran from December 8 through December 15. During the beta, players were able to progress through 20 levels of both the free Battle Pass and Premium Battle Pass. Plus, two licenses of unique minigame-like challenges were available to play through, as were races in both the Item Mode and the Speed mode. 
In this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley and Alex Stadnik will walk you through all that this beta had to offer. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming free-to-play kart racer.]]></summary>

Within minutes of playing the campaign or multiplayer, nostalgia hits hard, and the title reminds us why Halo is one of gaming’s most important series. Infinite is easily developer 343 Industries’ best Halo game to date, an effort that honors the series’ 20-year legacy while blazing a new trail forward for Master Chief and the Spartans. No matter what mode you dive into, the gameplay delivers the iconic “feel” that made the series’ first entries hard to put down and expands upon it in a variety of excellent ways.

Click here to watch embedded media


Henry Cavill has returned to reprise the role of the silvery-haired monster-slaying hunk Geralt of Rivia. Season two continues Geralt's adventures, this time with his apprentice Ciri (played by Freya Alan) in tow. Also returning this season are Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Vesimir (Kim Bodnia), Triss (Anna Shaffer), Lambert (Paul Bullion), and everyone's favorite bard Jaskier (Joey Batey), among a bevy of newcomers.
Have no fear; this won't be the last you'll see of these characters! Season three has already been confirmed, so feel free to take in the show at your own pace – like me, who has yet to watch any of season one, though I'd like to very soon.
Catch eight brand new episodes of The Witcher streaming right now on Netflix, with at least one more season coming in the future. And remember, toss a coin to your Witcher, but not at your television. That probably won't end well for the screen or your wallet.
Are you carving out time to catch this season of The Witcher? Which items and potions are needed to begin viewing Geralt's live-action adventures? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.

It turns out I was miles behind the curve, as The Architect Colon Paris already exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent is making another big game development acquisition with the purchase of Turtle Rock Studios' parent company Slamfire, Inc, which includes Turtle Rock in the deal.
According to a press release shared with Game Informer, the Left 4 Dead and Evolve developers will remain an independent operation at its current Lake Forest, California office. It was also noted that despite the studio's most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros. Games, the game and its continued development will not be affected. 
Steve Goldstein, president and general manager of Turtle Rock, had this to say about the acquisition, "Tencent’s outstanding partners, global reach, deep knowledge of gaming and unprecedented support will help us create the kinds of ambitious games we dream of, while allowing us to retain our autonomy and independent spirit.”
Tencent, for the uninitiated, is a massive Chinese holdings company that has investments all over the video game landscape. Here are some other companies you may or may not know that Tencent has a stake in:
Riot Games
And many more. The above names represent anywhere from 100% ownership in the case of Riot Games to a small stake like Tencent's 5% ownership in Ubisoft. With this newest acquisition of Turtle Rock and Slamfire, Tencent is bolstering its gaming portfolio even further with the veteran development talent.
No sale price was given at the time this story was written, nor were any details of any new games Turtle Rock may be working on past its current responsibilities regarding Back 4 Blood.

It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn't give a date for PC. But, surprise! It's today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur's Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.

We also get one final update on Imogen's Apex Legends rank. I'd love to say it's positive, but it's actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.

That’s because just over a week after a new trailer at The Game Awards 2021, Guerilla Games has released another trailer, this time giving us a better look at some of the new machines we’ll be fighting against in the game on February 18, 2022. Titled “Machines of the Forbidden West,” this trailer gives us a closer look at the armadillo-like Rollerback, the flying pterodactyl-like Sunwing, and the Slitherfang robot snake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it seems a new game based on everyone’s favorite busters could be on the way. 
That’s according to Winston Zeddemore actor, Ernie Hudson, at least. Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well.

“I just got an email because we’re doing another video game,” Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. “They’re scheduling it now to do the recording and I’m not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I’m not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game…When they’ll bring it out, I don’t know, but it’s definitely happening.” 
Speaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him “prototypes of the character to get the image right.” He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd’s likeness, he always ends up “looking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.” 
At the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn’t supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer’s Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019. Check out Game Informer’s review of the 2016 Ghostbusters game after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. 
Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. 
“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” 
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like:

If you haven’t yet played Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, you should – it’s great, and you can read about why in Game Informer’s Guardians of the Galaxy review. Find out which awards Guardians of the Galaxy took home at The Game Awards 2021 and then read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first event for Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, Fracture: Tenrai, wrapped up a couple of weeks ago and while it brought some new armor and game modes to the game, it was met with criticism largely surrounding the event-specific battle pass and its associated progression, store cosmetics, and more. 
It seems 343 Industries listened to feedback because yesterday, during a Halo Holiday 2021 livestream, the studio’s head of design, Jeff Hook, detailed various changes coming to Fracture: Tenrai when the event returns in January, as reported by Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games is the team behind well-received horror games Devotion and Detention, but it teased a seemingly less spooky new project in March. The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games' horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what's become their usual wheelhouse. 
In the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games' most recent release, Devotion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has temporarily halted sales of Final Fantasy XIV due to the ongoing Endwalker congestion issues. 
The company has also offered up additional free game-time to players who own the game or have an active subscription, adding another 14 days of time on top of the seven announced last week. This news comes by way of an FFXIV Lodestone blog post made yesterday by director and producer Naoki Yoshida. Yoshida originally issued warnings of expected Endwalker congestion in November and as predicted, the servers filled up immediately, with some players hitting queues with over 5000 people ahead of them.

It’s not surprising, though, considering the MMO added 1 million new players ahead of Endwalker’s launch.

The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn't been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this "does not imply admission of any responsibility".

More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is suffering from success, thanks, in part, to its recently released Endwalker expansion. Despite updates to ease server errors and long queue times, players are still struggling to log into the game. So, Square Enix have only gone and done it. They've temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

The first full year of a new platform cycle is always exciting. Developers have new technologies to leverage in game releases, and players begin to glimpse the potential of new hardware. This particular new generation of gaming has had an unusual start. The global pandemic meant significant changes to development pipelines, causing production setbacks and global shipping delays. This resulted in games arriving later and new hardware that was difficult to find – even for the most diligent gaming enthusiasts.
Despite those challenges, 2021 came together as an excellent year for video games, filled with remarkable new experiences for players to enjoy. We’ve selected and ranked our picks for the 10 best releases of the year, detailing exactly why these particul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…]]></summary>

After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy's next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. 
In a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn't say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.

These images do look great, and yes, I'm sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we're going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West's February 18 release.]]></summary>

Featuring the painterly and lush art style of A Plague Tale: Innocence, if one thing was clear with Requiem’s announcement, it’s that publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Asobo Studio are planning to up the ante. Today’s batch of in-game screenshots is proof of that. 
Released on Twitter earlier today, these four screenshots showcase some of what we can expect in Requiem. Based on what we know of the game so far, these screenshots show Amicia and Hugo in new cities south of France, which is the primary setting of the sequel.

The reboot was announced after years of speculation regarding what the next step was for stealth icon Sam Fisher. In an article on the Ubisoft website, word of Splinter Cell’s resurrection comes alongside an interview with developers working on refreshing the series. Producer Matt West sheds some light on the team’s ideas for the project, saying, “To me, a remake takes what you’d do in a remaster and goes a little bit further with it.” He goes on to state the plan is to stick close t…]]></summary>

A new narrative campaign for Terminator: Resistance just launched last week, and our war against the machines will bleed into 2022 with the newly announced RTS game, Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance. Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.
Set in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction's commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion's machines. As you make progress, you'll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.

Cats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.
If you'd rather play as the machines, you'll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.
Cats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.]]></summary>

I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we're talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I'm chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.

That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It's one of the best co-op games I've played, so it's a perfectly timed freebie if you're in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I've played this year. It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. "Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.

Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what's the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they're not well cool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, a report into Bungie's work culture unearthed allegations of racism, sexism, discrimination, toxic leadership and more besides. Current and former employees of the Destiny developers claim they've experienced "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard".

While play therapy has long promoted the therapeutic powers of escapism to imaginary worlds, it is more recently that thought has gone into how these online experiences can be used to combat my, I mean someone's, anxiety and depression.

        <updated>2021-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

It's a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead's Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Yup, it's official.
Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin's Creed Valhalla. They're not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can't or won't keep a secret, leaks have sprung up.
