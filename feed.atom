        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah instructional manuals, I missed you old friends
Thanks to a My Nintendo update, strategy booklets for Mario Strikers Switch are on the menu, hearkening back to the bygone era of manuals.
For the sum total cost of zero platinum points, you can download the strategy booklets for Mario Strikers Switch yourself. There's two in total: one that goes over basic techniques, and another that focuses on advanced mechanics. Both of them run the gamut of the game's tutorial system, and really, the advanced booklet isn't a bad thing to have near you as you're learning the game.
Interestingly, they fold in such a way that they can be turned into actual booklets. They even have a full page dedicated to folding and cutting! If you're game for a crafting project that requires identifying "mountain fold lines and valley fold lines" you're set this afternoon. As an added bonus: Thankfully, Nintendo has crafted the booklets to ensure they can both be stored in the actual Mario Strikers: Battle League case.
If only you could order physical manuals for every first-party Nintendo game
I get wanting to cut down on environmental footprints, but providing a "print on demand" service for manuals sounds like a really interesting potential market opportunity. Even if they were sparing and linked to the My Nintendo physical goods system, there's something there.

One of the perks of physical game ownership is being able to display your shiny new box on a shelf amongst your game collection. And if the base box art of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 isn't fitting in, or you'd just like some options, a new MyNintendo reward has you covered.
Over on the MyNintendo page, a collection of three alternative box arts for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is available now. The collection will run you 30 Platinum Points. It's available now through February 1, 2023, so you've got time to consider them.
Once you've redeemed the reward, getting your new art is pretty straightforward. Just download the files and print them on a color printer at actual size, on 8.5 x 11" (letter-sized) paper. Nintendo recommends using Gloss Text-type papers.

How to find the Machine Assassin in Xenoblade Chronicles 3
So this is by far the hardest class to find in the game, as it requires multiple quest chains. Note that you likely shouldn't attempt this until you're at least level 50, so you can just go back and eventually close this one out: or do some of the required quests along the way. Your choice.

One of the games we're most excited for this month is Shin-Chan: Me And The Professor On Summer Vacation – The Endless Seven-Day Journey — yes, the title really is that long. The game is inspired by the My Summer Vacation series and has been developed by the same team, Millennium Kitchen.
Originally released in Japan last year, we didn't expect we'd ever see it in the West. But we were pleasantly surprised a few months ago when publisher Neos Corporation revealed the game would be coming out in English this summer! One of the biggest reasons we were surprised is that none of the My Summer Vacation games made their way over to the West, but we still wanted to celebrate the upcoming Shin-Chan game's release by playing one of Millennium Kitchen's games. And, so, we did.

Sony plans to drop support for the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5, and if you've got a PS5 and you don't know what I'm referring to, you aren't alone. Accolades were intended as a way for PS5 players to show "appreciation" for others in online multiplayer games.
Users can send Accolades like Helpful, Good Sport, Leader, and Welcoming as a little feel-good post-match moment, and the badges are listed in player profiles.
A nice idea in theory, right? Well, in a new notice posted today, Sony said it would discontinue PS5 Accolades due to lower-than-anticipated usage.

ININ Games has confirmed that both Ray'z Arcade Chronology and RayStorm x RayCrysis HD Collection will both be released in western territories. The remastered shmup classics will release in North America, Europe, and other territories at some unspecified point following their Japanese release.
As previously reported, Ray'z Arcade Chronology — currently scheduled for launch in Japan in March 2023 — is a compendium of series classics gathered together for PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The collection will include RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996), and RayCrisis (1998). Also included are two brand new remasters, RayCrisis HD and RayStorm NEO-HD. The latter title is itself a remaster of a remaster, boosted with new extra features and vital 16:9 monitor support.
RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection, which seems a strangely redundant alternate collection, will apparently include all of the same titles listed above but will omit the original RayForce.
https://twitter.com/ININ_Games/status/1553365037355606017?s=20&t=VgjMbozrmZ52t9WVf0RFyg
RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection will be made available digitally and physically, while Ray'z Arcade Chronology will launch digitally worldwide and will receive an exclusive physical release via boutique outlet Strictly Limited Games. This edition features a boxed release of the game alongside additional collectible memorabilia including a CD soundtrack, a strategy guide, old-school arcade-style stickers, a hardcover art book, and other neat goodies.

Ray'z Arcade Chronology and RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection are currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch We will be sure to give you a heads up when new information regarding western launch dates is made available.

Evo 2022 kicks off this weekend. But before the fighting game festivities get underway, Riot Games is updating fans on the status of its own fighting game code-named Project L. It's also confirming that Project L will be free-to-play.
A new dev diary for Project L was published this morning, with developer Tom Cannon talking a bit about where the project is at. The team has been hard at work on development over the months since its last showing, spotlighting its assist features.
As the team continues to grow both its roster and features, Cannon confirms that the new Riot game will be a free-to-play title.

Splatoon 3 is just a handful of weeks away from launch, with the sequel heading to the Switch on September 9th. Despite the fact that Nintendo has been drip-feeding bits of news here and there on Twitter, including new songs, gear reveals, and new multiplayer maps, there's a distinct feeling amongst the community that the marketing around the game has been a bit lacklustre.
It's no surprise, either. The launch of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has understandably taken up a lot of Nintendo's time over the past few weeks, with the company bombarding fans with new trailers, gameplay footage, interviews, and more. Now that the game is out, though, can we expect Nintendo to shift its focus over to Splatoon 3? Well, yes, theoretically. That hasn't stopped some fans from getting quite worried, though, particularly in the wake of a new Pokémon Presents being announced for later this week (though we fully acknowledge that this is more of a Pokémon Company event rather than a Nintendo one):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Summer 2022 edition
It's no Nintendo Power, but the latest translated Nintendo Magazine issue just arrived online, directly from the aforementioned publisher.
The magazine, which serves largely as a marketing tool, is printed physically in Japan — but a new tweet from Nintendo has provided a digital version that's been fully translated into English. The focus of this issue, appropriately, is "summer," with Kirby serving as the cover story. Given that Forgotten Land starts on a beach, it seems like a good match.
Here are some highlights from the Summer 2022 translated Nintendo Magazine:
A 30th anniversary Kirby special with a giant timeline
A spread on Nintendo Switch Sports and Ring Fit Adventure, with workout poses to try
"Summer" themed looks at Pokemon Legends and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
A Mario Strikers: Battle League personality test
A quick look at all six main characters from Xenoblade Chronicles 3
A cute in-universe Splatoon 3 Squid Ecology Research Memo
A micro-calendar for July, August, and September
You can find the full magazine here. Note that going to the bottom right and selecting "contents" will let you jump around.
Ideally, Nintendo does this for all issues of pretty much anything they make. It might take time to translate them, but given the positive response so far, it seems worth the effort.

Rawlab Games, in collaboration with Japanese company Tatsujin, has announced that the erotic '90s arcade game Pipi & Bibi’s is currently in development for the Nintendo Switch. Originally released in 1991, the game was developed by Toaplan, but after the company's bankruptcy in 1994, most of its IP rights went over to Tatsujin.
As reported by Go Nintendo, the remaster will launch under the title Spy Bros. (Pipi & Bibi’s DX) and is currently targeted for Q4 2022. The publisher has announced that little is being done to alter the game's visuals and mechanics, with the developer opting to stay true to the original's aethetics, however design improvements and bonus content will be included in the new release (so it's probably more of a modern port than a remaster).

The irrepressible, unstoppable, unavoidable meme nightmare Neco-Arc is headed to the roster of Melty Blood: Type Lumina.
Neco-Arc, the bizarrely drawn parody mascot of the Tsuskihime franchise, has finally decided the time is right to take her pint-sized form and terrifying, oversized eyes into the ring, where she will square off against the mystical maidens of Melty Blood.

I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

El Gato Del Tejado is taking it upon themselves to craft a Simpsons Hit and Run remaster, and it's going extremely well so far.
In the first half of the latest development video, the mod creator walks us through some in-engine shots of the project; giving us an update on some of the game's character models, namely Lisa Simpson. They chronicle the journey of getting a 3D model to show up correctly in-game — and folks, it ain't easy!
But by far the big deal here is how the creator chose to alter the game's cutscenes. Originally they wanted to see cutscenes with "modern 3D technology" like the latest Crash re-releases, but without much experience in 3D animation, they opted for 2D. Deciding to "do it by hand," they learned the animation style of the show, consulting series bibles to get it done (which series creator Matt Groening has documented endlessly). To my amazement, it basically looks like the show.
The results are....insane. Multiple comparison shots are provided in the video below, which are near indistinguishable from certain eras of The Simpsons on TV. At this point, the project is basically a resume. Hire this person! In fact, hire them to do an official Simpsons Hit and Run remaster.

Bandai Namco's Digimon Survive launched last Friday, and many Digimon fans have rushed out to grab a copy of the game. Out on Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and PC, the game combines visual novel elements with some strategy RPG gameplay, and is a very different Digimon game altogether.
However, despite some fans' excitement at getting this much-delayed Digimon game, Digimon Survive is currently being review bombed over on Metacritic. TheGamer reports that users are flocking to the aggregate website to share their opinions and score the game down. Over the weekend, the User Score for the Switch version was right down to 1.6, and by the time TheGamer spotted it, it had jumped up a little to 4.3.

Microsoft released its results for the fourth quarter of its financial year, ending June 30, 2022. The figures show something of a disparity between sectors. While gaming revenue on a whole is down, the Xbox Game Pass subscription model continues to grow, with millions of players utilizing the online service. The news was delivered in an investor earnings call called transcribed by GamesIndustry.biz.
Microsoft gaming revenue fell by some 7% year-on-year, which translates to somewhere in the region of $260 million USD. While this is, of course, a huge figure, it is still a drop in the ocean in comparison to the $3 billion overall revenue generated by the Microsoft brand during the three-month period. In addition, Xbox hardware revenue has decreased by 11%, which is disappointing given that we're still, essentially, in the honeymoon period of new-gen platform Xbox Series X/S. Despite this decrease, Microsoft states that the new platform is selling faster than previous Xbox generations, and that Xbox currently leading the market in sales over rival platform PlayStation 5.
Microsoft's ace-in-the-hole continues to be the Xbox Game Pass service, which continues to welcome more subscribers with each passing month. In addition, Microsoft's recent partnership with Epic Games facilitated four million players logging into battle royale juggernaut Fortnite via Xbox Cloud Gaming, over a million players being entirely new to the Xbox infrastructure. Despite us being instilled into the ninth generation, it seems that — for both Microsoft and Sony — the current success trend lies not so much in the individual hardware and/or software sales, but in the services, game libraries, day-one launches, and other utilities that their respective subscription services provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A landmark event for the uncertainty of the series
As we move further and further into the era of not knowing what's happening to Smash, Smash Ultimate screenshots have run their course.
The news comes directly from Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai, who confirmed it on Twitter with the following message:
"Posting daily Smash Ultimate screens has been part of my workday ritual for a while now...but it's looking like I'll run out sometime in August. I even took around 200 new ones as we were wrapping up development, so it's hard to believe they're already gone. Time sure does fly!"

Sakurai has been sharing Smash Ultimate screenshots for several years
For reference, Sakurai has been taking and sharing screenshots of Smash Ultimate for some time, typically showcasing oddball scenarios or pushing the engine to its limits/breaking it with development tools. Amazingly, Sakurai confirmed that he'd have to stop doing it eventually on December 26, 2021, but has kept going since then. The reason for the shift is because he is no longer using development kits/tools.
It's been a fun run! So if everything comes to a close in August, he has less than 30 more to go, following the one shared today of Game & Watch and Wii Fit Trainer.

<p>More specifically, this upcoming Pokémon Presents will air at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET on Aug. 3 – so this Wednesday. As for what to expect, the tweet announcing this presentation says we'll be getting updates on Pokémon apps (Pokémon Sleep perhaps?) and games, including Scarlet and Violet.</p>

An August 3 Pokemon stream is confirmed! The Pokemon Company tweeted out the news this morning, noting that there will be a 9AM ET presentation on that day.
The tweet says that there will be "updates on Pokemon apps and video games, including Scarlet and Violet," so at least one project is called out by name. The rest is up in the air, but given the format for the past year or so, we kind of know what some of the usual suspects are.
In case you forgot what they look like, we have a recap of a previous presentation here. They can provide numerous details for mobile/spinoff projects, with a big finish that focuses on "mainline games." There's a 99.9% chance we'll get confirmation of more creatures (and a look at some returning Pokemon), as well as some quick looks at several mechanical changes/additions to the formula with the new generational leap.
Here is what we could see touched upon in the August 3 Pokemon stream:
Pokemon Unite anniversary event updates
More on Pokemon Cafe/Pokemon Masters EX
A quick update on Pokemon Go
Potentially more merch/hardware
A big ending that provides details for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet

Xenoblade Chronicles' protagonist Shulk is pretty well known in the Nintendo community as the picture of innocence; a truly noble hero who always puts his friends and allies first. Apparently, however, according to a recent video from Did You Know Gaming, Shulk's actions during one of the game's cutscenes alarmed scenario writer Yurie Hattori, who was brought in during the game's development.
As pointed out by series' Executive Director Tetsuya Takahashi, Hattori-san was worried that Shulk's decision to touch the cheek of an unconscious Fiora to express his feelings for her might be construed as creepy. As such, the action was changed for the final game, with Shulk instead touching Fiora's hand.

Next month, the first video game adaptation of the hit anime series Made in Abyss will be hitting the Switch. And thanks to the eShop and Nintendo Everything, we might have a good idea how big a hole you'll need to dig to make room for the game.
The upcoming RPG from Spike Chunsoft, Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness, will have both a retelling of the anime (with production supervised by the creator Akihito Tsukushi) plus an original story set after main characters Riko and Reg leave for the Abyss.

For Tony Hawk's Pro Skater tribute act 'The 900', it was likely going to be "just another gig". Described as "The UK's first and only Tony Hawk's Pro Skater cover band", the act plays a variety of cover songs from THPS1 all the way to American Wasteland and was due to perform at Signature Brew in East London on July 30th.
To the surprise of everyone - including the band - Tony Hawk himself showed up, joining The 900 on stage to perform two of the most popular songs from the Pro Skater series - Goldfinger's 'Superman', and Agent Orange's 'Bloodstains'. It turned what was likely going to be a pretty standard evening for the band into an unforgettable experience for everyone involved.

Even though Super Smash Bros. Ultimate "ended" with the release of the last Fighters Pass character — Kingdom Hearts' Sora — it still hasn't felt "over" for us. That's because Masahiro Sakurai, Mr. Smash Bros. himself, has continued a long-standing tradition of posting a new screenshot from the game every single day.
We're envious of pretty much all of them, as Sakurai managed to capture characters, locations, and moments in such a perfect way that really understands the characters. In fact, seeing these screenshots every day has brought us a little bit of happiness — and envy. But it looks like this tradition might soon be over, as Sakurai has admitted on Twitter that he's almost run out of screens!

Gameloft's free-to-play racing game Disney Speedstorm has already been compared to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe numerous times.

But, in an interview with Nintendo Everything, the developer is keen to set out what makes this title stand out from Nintendo's juggernaut kart racer.
While Mario Kart 8 has different types of karts, stats, and even racer weights, Disney Speedstorm will have four different classes. When asked about what makes this game "stand out", Gameloft Barcelona's game manager — Aska Suzuki — put forward this unique element first:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kill the Wabbit
This past weekend saw fight fans lock horns in Warner Bros.' brand new scrapper MultiVersus, the crossover fighter having just launched its open access beta on PC and console platforms — and while the fur has only been flying for a few days, already characters are queued up to have their wings clipped by developer Player First Games.
In something of an obscure tweet posted this weekend, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh noted that "Nerfs Inc." would be headed to the title post-EVO (which takes place in Las Vegas this weekend). While no specific characters were announced for the chopping block, Huynh added that "Bugs Bunny will always be fun."
https://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1552517058918682624?s=20&t=unq02SbgfNGQK4ddQ-VM9A
No doubt Huynh is pointing toward the fact that the carrot-chomping smart arse is already proving to be something of a dominant player within MultiVersus' crossover world. Bugs has seemingly overshot Taz as somebody singled out as something of a problem character for players, after the latter had his devastating Tornado Spin attack scaled right down scant hours into the beta's launch.
In a chaotic platform fighter such as MultiVersus, it can be difficult to accurately ascertain who may have a leg-up on the competition. Add to that the way ALL fighting game players call for nerfs within minutes of a title's launch, and it takes a sharp developer to truly ascertain which characters are actually broken and which characters players are simply "losing to" as they aren't bothering to learn the matchup.
Either way, MultiVersus has had an immensely healthy beta launch, with over 144,000 players logging into Steam at its peak period. We shall see how the title retains its audience over the coming weeks and months. MultiVersus is now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Massage Freaks, the raunchy rthythm game from publisher qureate, has been quietly released on Steam. Not only that, but it's also received a complete name change and is now called 'beat refle', which sounds like a bit of a play on the term 'Reflexology'. It's certainly a more "neutral" title, that's for sure.
The release follows a storm of controversy following the initial reveal of Massage Freaks. Its depiction of women and the scenarios in which they find themselves caused many to draw comparisons to real-life sex crimes in Japan. In addition, the forenames of the in-game characters were identical to some of the members of Japanese idol group 'Hinatazaka46' before qureate swifly made moves to alter them. Indeed, the Steam page for beat refle contains a few choice statements to potentially avoid any future controversy:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rock, Rock, Rockin' Rollergames...
It's time to get your skates on, quite literally, (well, digitally), as the retro fun fans over at Hamster have added Nichibutsu's whirling derby dervish Roller Jammer to PS4 and Nintendo Switch — the latest addition to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range.
Release to arcades way back in 1984, Roller Jammer is a very loose take on the world's most complicated sport: Roller Derby. Instead of being packed out with screaming, tattoed gals sporting cool names like "Anna Geddon", this digital take on hard-hitting wheeled warfare features a bunch of boring 8-bit dudes. We were still a good six years away from the debut of the outrageous, WWE-like show Rollergames, and thus Roller Jammer boasts a less glamorous, simplistic take on the sport.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqW8NZ3bQ_8
Perhaps understanding that it does not have tech available to recreate the ins and outs of roller derby proper, Nichibutsu chooses to play a little fast and loose with its adaptation of the sport, tasking playing with gunning through thin slaloms of flags before eventually engaging in an every-man-for-themselves race, complete with a hilarious "double lariat" maneuver. While Roller Jammer's relative obscurity makes this Arcade Archives release a little notable, ultimately it's pretty difficult to recommend this title.
Roller Jammer is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

We've seen countless game-to-TV or film adaptations announced over the past few months, and while it's exciting to see some really great properties getting even more love, part of me wishes we could see more pre-existing properties be turned into licensed games. Take one of the most beloved game franchises of all time: The Witcher. Those were books before they were games, and CD Projekt Red's take on the adventures of Geralt brought a fresh take to the series, just like the Netflix series that came after it.
What got me thinking about all of this in the first place is that I finally got around to watching Season 4 of Stranger Things, and I was reminded of the Telltale series adaptation of the show that never saw the light of day.

The second wave of the new Booster Course tracks for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will be here next week, and we're feeling hyped to try out some new races (and a little disappointed that some of them look more like Mario Kart Tour tracks than Mario Kart 8 tracks).
In the spirit of hype, we're trying to gauge how people are feeling about this new wave, and the DLC in general. Is it everything you'd hoped for? A cool bonus to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription? A bit disappointing? Or are you just totally bummed that Nintendo is pumping time and money into an old Mario Kart game instead of something else — like a new Mario Kart game?

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
In last week's edition, Metroid Prime - one of the greatest console games of all time - entered the ring. As we'd predicted, it was a pretty close battle, but Japan's more action-packed (if you can call it that) design just managed to beat out North America and Europe's more restrained approach with 53% of the vote. It just goes to show that even the most iconic box art design is not necessarily the best one.

Nintendo preservation website Forest of Illusion has managed to acquire another rare piece of gaming history. It's been able to archive a Japan prototype of the Nintendo DS X4 firmware - recovered from an X4 prototype unit.
According to the source, "just about every aspect of this version is different from the final retail release". One of the highlights is the boot up screen. Instead of featuring the Nintendo DS logo, it appears to be a GBA placeholder screen and a sound file of children shouting "Nintendo" (you can have a listen below).

Putting the cat in catastrophe
The second I saw the announcement trailer for Stray, I knew it was a game I was going to play on release day, no questions asked. I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book. While it was pretty easy to get me on board with the premise of Stray alone, one thing I wasn't expecting was just how rich and compelling the story was going to be in this game. I mean, it was published by Annapurna so that should have been my first clue, but even so, it slipped my mind.

It's nice to see a cool off-the-radar indie game resurface with a release window after years of wondering. This is my first time seeing The Siege and the Sandfox, but as a stealth-based metroidvania with detailed pixel art, it quickly left a good impression.
The developers at Cardboard Sword have teamed up with publisher Koch Media to launch their debut game. Along with a new trailer this week (which helps reintroduce the "stealthvania" concept), they've set their sights on a 2023 release on PC.

Welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? friends. It's yer boy Moyse, back in black and hoping to help you get your weekend off to a fine start. This has been a pretty hectic week for me, with some frustrating health drama and general ongoing malaise, but the beat goes on and so do I. As is always the case, July has been a slow month for the good ship Destructoid, with the annual news drought in full swing. Though Gamescom is just around the corner, to be followed up by the fall schedule, this year is definitely something of an anomaly, given that the biggest and most anticipated games are already on the market.
Still, at least we've all been given a lot of good stuff to play in The Year of Our Lord 2022, and with more than enough time to get through it all way ahead of…]]></summary>

I've had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that's down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start 'old' games all the time, and maybe it's less useful than ever now every other game is a live service.

I thought tonight we could fullscreen the rest of Stray, the atmospheric kitty game taking the internet by storm, and then focus on doing some more wildly difficult puzzles in Baba Is You or The Witness. See you tonight!

I’ll need your brainpower. Be sure to drink plenty of water and stay cool.

I once described the SNES version of Rampart as not “the most faithful” but “the version that best fits on consoles.” I maybe stand by that, but I have a contender for the least faithful. While the NES got a decent version of Rampart, the Famicom, for whatever reason, got a completely different one. This isn’t the only time this has happened. The case of the NES/Famicom disparity of Maniac Mansion is another one. An equally confusing one.
Rampart on Famicom was developed by Konami by most of the team that would go on to create games like Lagrange Point and Batman Returns. A talented team to be sure. It’s clear that the development team played Rampart, but they didn’t seem that interested in replicating the gameplay.

Final Fantasy XIV has no shortage of content. Raids, dungeons, trials, mount farming, or just good ol' fishing, there's always something to do. But between every activity, I find the one thing I keep on doing in Final Fantasy XIV is messing around with the interface.
Since starting the game back in December, I've managed to go from A Realm Reborn all the way to Endwalker, the most recent expansion. (Yes, that pace was pretty fast, though sadly not on par with Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.)
In the time since, I've learned a lot of lessons: eat food to buff your stats, use retainers to sell unwanted items, and know which ledges are not safe to Dragoon-backflip next to. But in all of it, I keep on messing with my hotbars.

It was during IndieCade 2014 that the team behind indie hit Before Your Eyes knew they had something. They were showing a student project, titled Close Your at the time. And even in its earliest state, it was emotionally resonating with people who played it.
"People were crying, you know, after sitting down with it for 15 minutes," remembers Graham Parkes, creative director and lead writer at GoodbyeWorld Games. 
The group had brought a student project to show off, next to up-and-coming experiences like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. They didn't know at the time that it would kick off a seven-year journey, eventually leading to a published release under Skybound and a BAFTA.

Hollywood has already taken two different shots at the Tomb Raider franchise, starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander respectively, but it looks like there's a chance another actress will get a chance to helm the series, as TheWrap reports. The film rights to Tomb Raider are up for grabs yet again after MGM failed to make a sequel after the 2018 film, which would have allowed them to keep the rights — although there were plans to make another film in the series at one point.
The most likely factor in plans for the sequel fizzling out is Amazon's acquisition of MGM back in March of this year. There's a good chance that with the merger going on, any projects in the works were put on pause, which is unfortunate when there's a ticking clock for maintaining your IPs. Fans had a lukewarm reaction regarding the 2018 movie, but it did fairly well at the box office internationally, so it's kind of a shame that they're not getting a second chance with Vikander's version of Croft.

Tomb Raider's treasure-hunting counterpart Uncharted (also sometimes called Dude Raider by fans) did quite well in the box office this year, raking in just over $400 million, and securing its spot as the fourth most profitable video game movie to date. It's hard to say whether this had to do with its star-studded cast, which included Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, or if fans just liked the movie more, but either way, I think it shows that fans are still down for an Indiana Jones-inspired action adventure.
There's a good chance that we'll be getting another reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise from whoever picks up the rights, so here's hoping that the third time's a charm for the franchise. Until then, there's always the Tomb Raider anime that Netflix still has in the works.

      <p>Game delays are a part of life. You know the old saying, a delayed game is…well, you know. It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.</p>

It's a constant struggle for game developers to stand out on Steam, and flashy artwork has been a big way to try and draw players in long enough to click through to a game's store page. I'm sure you've noticed the busy banners. Things have escalated to a point that Valve isn't comfortable with, and the company has solidified its guidelines — and announced new rules that'll go into effect in September — regarding artwork on Steam.
As explained in a Steamworks Development post, Valve wants to "make it as clear and straightforward as possible for customers to find games to buy and play on Steam."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

      <p>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23's on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.</p>

<p>We'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.</p>

<p>NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.</p>

<p>More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

      <p>"A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions." This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-review-into-the-great-wide-open">Genshin Impact</a>, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region,&nbsp;Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.</p>

<p>Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>

<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.</p>

<p>Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.</p>

<p>The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjpWlBwHwek" target="_blank">pre-alpha trailer</a>&nbsp;and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310134087112"></iframe>

<p>Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the game’s <a href="https://thelostwild.com/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.</p>

<p>Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/wattam/a-charming-little-storybook" target="_blank">Wattam</a>, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising&nbsp;new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming&nbsp;with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6310132198112"></iframe>

<p>Players control Clementine McKinny, a&nbsp;bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trust mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.</p>

<p>Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches&nbsp;in 2023.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade's most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.</p>

<p>A dev diary during today's Annapurna Showcase doesn't reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog's face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing&nbsp;than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kentucky-route-zero/kentucky-route-zero-review-a-surreal-road-trip" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn't hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

No, you've not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

      <p>In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/13/bayonetta-3-release-date-announced-with-over-the-top-trailer" target="_blank">a new Bayonetta game</a> in just a few short months. But hey, let's not forget the classics, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today on Game Informer Live, we're revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive&nbsp;people <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/10/bayonetta-is-the-best-playing-game-ever-made" target="_blank">will say is one of the best</a>&nbsp;games of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that's not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1542555508" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1538692939" target="_blank">second</a> archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we're finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're going live on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer" target="_blank">Twitch page</a> at&nbsp;3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!</p>]]></summary>

"Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

      <p>Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. </p>

      <p>WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood&nbsp;by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.</p>

<p>Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/03/the-foundation-played-by-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-now-unlockable-in-fortnite" target="_blank">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this&nbsp;trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate&nbsp;“forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw&nbsp;more sports entertainment into the mix&nbsp;by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.&nbsp;</p>

To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

      <p>Hey, I don't want to go to work today. I want to stay home and play all my video games<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTrd7m5mRso" target="_blank">.</a> Luckily, I can do just that. Care to join?</p>

<p>Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I'll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix's fantastic Neon White on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a>. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/neon-white/holy-hell" target="_blank">highest&nbsp;score</a> ever, if you're wondering – but I'm starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that, I'll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1538692939" target="_blank">from last week</a>. We're building the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=real+grade+wing+gundam&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1012US1012&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsYT6uNhKTWkike_2hPW_dISb43zpA:1658771717524&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB5fGXzpT5AhVUJX0KHYrSAgMQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1321&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=GZQzn5xo5nRRFM" target="_blank">Real Grade Wing Gundam</a>, and there's still lots to work on.

      <p>A flying wyvern known as the&nbsp;Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.</p>

<p>Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak/harrowing-hunts">review for Sunbreak</a>, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s <a>plenty</a>&nbsp;to love in Sunbreak."</p>

<p>This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans&nbsp; Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.</p>

<p>“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”</p>

<p>This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/27/star-wars-jedi-survivor-continues-cal-kestis-quest-in-2023">trailer</a>, but will soon get its first action figure.

      <p>Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?</p>

<p>The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me.&nbsp;I’m hoping your responses inspire&nbsp;me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!</p>]]></summary>

      <p>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy&nbsp;we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by <em>Shameless</em> star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66.

So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag & hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a building game that doesn't need constant babysitting. I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new indie horror game released today has challenged players to beat it within Steam's two-hour window to claim a refund. Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

That’s why it’s awesome to see someone using the power of publicly accessible AI to generate fantasy mugshots for classic examples of the genre such as Baldur’s Gate. Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

      <p>Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/summer-game-fest/2022/06/09/new-gotham-knights-trailer-shows-off-a-variant-nightwing-suit-and">Nightwing</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/28/robins-gotham-knights-toolkit-includes-teleportation-and-slingshots">Robin</a>, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.</p>

<p>Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.</p>

<p>The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.</p>

<p>Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog's development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.</p>

<p>Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.</p>

<p>If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.</p>

<p>Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.</p>

<p>Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?</p>]]></summary>
