        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though I'm not awfully picky when it comes to games, I do have some strong preferences. Card battlers, for example, are a guilty pleasure, and I've played most of them. That's why I'm excited about Monster Train 2, the sequel to one of the best card battlers on the market.


Don't get me wrong: there's a huge number of excellent card battler games available right now. In fact, the original card battler, Slay the Spire, is about to get a full-featured sequel sometime soon-ish, which is a huge deal in its own right. Yet, the original Monster Train had me hooked from the get-go, and I kept coming back to the game over and over again. The developer Shiny Shoe has announced Monster Train 2 with a snazzy new trailer and an equally snazzy free demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie's had its fair share of lawsuits over the years, though the vast majority of them have had to do with the company pursuing cheaters and hackers. A far more serious case has since sprung up, however, and it concerns the former director Christopher Barret, who was fired over misconduct.


More specifically, Christopher Barret worked on the upcoming Bungie extraction shooter Marathon when he was fired over alleged misconduct. The details of what went down in the background have been rather hazy up until now, and it likely would've stayed that way had Barret not chosen to legally pursue Bungie and Sony over what he claims was a "sham" investigation into his behavior. It would seem that Sony is sick and tired of this entire schtick, however, because the company has effectively responded …]]></summary>

A simple sentiment is often the most effective, and the title of Dragon Age veteran Mark Darrah's latest video cuts right to the heart of it: "Your $70 doesn't buy you cruelty."
You don't have to like a game, and you don't have stay quiet if you have complaints, says Darrah. You're entitled to be angry, and you're entitled to express that anger. "If you are mad at that Ubisoft game, be mad at Ubisoft," he says. "Express your anger to Ubisoft or the studio that made the game. But you cross a line when you start being cruel about it."

The Pokémon Company has today announced (via Serebii) that a Pokémon Presents showcase will be coming our way on 27th February at 2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 9am ET / 6am PT — wait, that's Pokémon Day!
Of course, this will come as a surprise to absolutely no one. TPC always tends to use the anniversary of Red and Green's Japanese release to show us what's happening in the world of 'mon for the year ahead, and this year is no exception. Pair that predictability with the Pokémon GO datamine from back in January, and yeah, we were pretty sure this one was a dead cert.

        <updated>2025-02-20T06:31:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the latest rumors are to be believed, the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC is going to be added to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team as part of the next campaign.


EA Sports have already confirmed Fantasy FC and most of the new cards will be available in packs. However, some cards like Joao Felix are going to be added via SBCs and objectives, making it easier for all to get them. While EA Sports hasn't announced details about the upcoming SBC, here are my predictions about its release date and possible costs.


EA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC release date (Expected)


The Fantasy FC promo begins on Friday, February 21. Typically, EA Sports always schedules a big SBC on the first night of a new promo. If I had to predict, Felix could well be that on SBC, and fans could end up getting the card as early as Friday, February 21.


However, weekends are also possible dates for EA Sports to release big SBCs in Ultimate Team. Hence, February 22 or February 23 could also be possible dates for the challenge to be released in Ultimate Team.


EA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC costs (Predicted)


There have been very few SBCs this year that have been in the middle of the road when it comes to completion costs. I feel that the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC could be priced similarly along with the Ferland Mendy Grassroot Greats SBC. Hence, it's best to reserve around 600,000 coins worth of fodder if you want to add Felix to your squad.


If you're unwilling to wait, there are some worthy choices to consider from the ongoing Grassroot Greats SBC. N'Golo Kante is an exceptional defensive midfielder you can add to your squad, who will boss the middle of the field. If you're on a shorter budget, the Moise Bombito Grassroot Greats SBC offers excellent value at less than 100,000 coins worth of fodder.

The Tunnel in the Cliffs can be found in Apollonia on the eastern side of the Trosky region. It's located on the southern section of Apollonia just off the narrow path west of the main road. It's where you'll find most of the dangers the area is famous for, so take care while visiting.


You can start at the Apollonia fast travel location. If you don't have it unlocked, you can reach the spot by taking the road east from Troskowitz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited Magic: The Gathering and FINAL FANTASY collaboration for MTG's Universes Beyond series has finally been revealed, and you can now claim as many packs as you want ahead of the set's release on June 13.


Yesterday, Wizards Of The Coast revealed how the iconic Final Fantasy summons would work on this collaboration. The company also revealed the cards of some of the most iconic characters in the history of the series. The most hype reveals so far, were those of Cloud and Tidus, who'll be part of the commander set.

These are the two main characters in the two most successful Final Fantasy titles so far, meaning Wizards would naturally be big selling points for this new set. Still, the company reminds players that the set features characters from every single one of the 16 mainline Final Fantasy series.


Among the reveals so far, my favorite has to be Jumbo Cactuar, a card whose special ability, "10,000 Needles," will annihilate anyone who doesn't find a way to stop it. What a beautiful way to celebrate one of the most ridiculous special moves ever seen in a game.

You can now preorder some items from the Magic: The Gathering — FINAL FANTASY set. Through Amazon, you can already preorder the Starter Kit, Play Boosters, Play Booster bundles, and commander decks, except the one featuring Cloud.


Bundles, Collector Boosters, and Commander Deck Bundles will likely become available to preorder anytime now. Prerelease packs are available for preorder at your local store.


The Magic: The Gathering — FINAL FANTASY will be released on June 13, except for the Gift Bundle, which comes out on June 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FC Fantasy is going to be the next promo coming to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and it could include some amazing cards for players to obtain.


Fantasy is going to be a returning promo since we had the campaign back in FC 24. So far, EA Sports hasn't dropped any hints about which cards will be released during the campaigns. A few leaks have already started making the rounds ahead of the promo's official release in Ultimate Team.


All EA FC 25 FC Fantasy promo players (leaks)


If you believe the leaks, the upcoming promo will have special cards for both active footballers and Heroes. The latter represents former footballers who have hung up their playing boots following illustrious careers. Last year, we had the same pattern, so history might be about to repeat itself.



Eden Hazard


Joe Cole


Omar Marmoush


Heung-Min Son


Khvicha Kvaratskhelia


Donyell Malen


Aurelien Tchouameni


Crystal Dunn


Viktor Tsygankov


Moises Caicedo


Philip Billing


Babajide



Of course, the leaks so far are limited in numbers, as more names are expected to appear as we get closer to the release date. Once again, the promo cards might be Dynamic: they will receive boosts and upgrades based on results from real-life football.


EA FC 25 FC Fantasy promo release date


The release date was given away when we received Season 5 of Ultimate Team. Based on the available information, the upcoming promo will be a two-week-long affair, and the first team will be released on Friday, February 21. This will be followed by the second team on February 28, which will add new cards to packs.


Once again, most of the promo items will be available in packs, but expect to find a few great items in the form of objectives and SBCs. Last year, we had some great SBCs like Timo Werner and Fridolina Rolfo. It will be interesting to see what EA Sports has planned for the community as part of the upcoming campaign for Ultimate Team.

The Moogle Treasure Trove is a recurring event in FFXIV that provides players a new way to get their hands on old, sought-after items. By completing objectives and challenges, players can stock up on Irregular Tomestones and then exchange them with the Itinerant Moogle in any of the three major city-states for a selection of goodies.

The next Moogle Treasure Trove event is The Hunt for Phantasmagoria, which will allow players to grab some very worthwhile rewards, including the following stand-out stars (all shown in the image above):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fran Kirby Grassroot Greats SBC brings a new challenge to complete in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and you can complete it to add a new card to your squad.


This is the first time that Kirby has received a promo item in Ultimate Team this year. To play with the card, you'll have to complete the SBC and all its tasks. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card and add it to your Ultimate Team squad.


EA FC 25 Fran Kirby Grassroot Greats SBC tasks


The Fran Kirby Grassroot Greats SBC has two tasks, and here are their requirements.


Task 1 - England



Min. 1 Players from: England


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Fran Kirby Grassroot The Greats SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest promo challenge in Ultimate Team.


Task 1 - England



Jonsdottir 82


Catarina Macario 84


Vlahovic 84


Dani Olmo 84


Aleix Garcia 84


Mbock 84


Bronze 85


Fabian Ruiz 82


Camavinga 82


Reece James 84


Acerbi 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Patri 88


Caruso 84


Neville 83


Openda 85


Bright 85


Any 85-rated TOTW item


Aleix Garcia 84


Dabritz 84


Pavard 84


Coman 84


Koulibaly 84



While the SBC is pretty well-valued, the card on offer is below the power curve. The only option is to add her to the Grassroot Growth Evolution and improve the card to a 90-rated item. That will also add Tiki Taka+ as a second playstyle, making it a pretty useful bargain item in Ultimate Team.


If you're looking for cheaper SBCs with better value, the Athenea Grassroot Greats SBC and Moise Bombito Grassroot Greats SBC are great shouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been holding out—and I have to be honest, missing out—on playing developer Wrong Organ's psychological-horror title Mouthwashing, well now you have no excuse. Publisher Critical Reflex announced today that Mouthwashing will be heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year.




The unique horror game that uses nostalgic PSX-style visuals to tell the haunting tale of the doomed crew aboard a space freighter called the Tulpar was released on Steam in September 2024 and has sold over 500,000 copies on the platform. According to Critical Reflex, fans interested in a physical edition on the PS5 or Switch will have the opportunity to snag one through Fangamer.


Honestly, Mouthwashing is one of those games that that least you know going into it, the better. If you're a fan of psychological horror games that are a bit out there in terms of narrative and setting, you won't find a better example. However, if you want to have somewhat of an idea of what to expect, here is the premise:


In Mouthwashing you explore the story of a dying crew aboard a shipwrecked space freighter hauling mouthwash across the expanse of space. You'll switch between various crew members in first-person as you explore what caused the shipwreck as well as what has transpired since, all while trying to come up with a gameplan. The ship will only stay powered for a few months, and food will run out well before then. But at least there's mouthwash, right? For the most part it's a narrative-driven experience, and one well worth experiencing.


The crew of the Tulpar and Mouthwashing crashlands on PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year. Those interested in playing now can do so on PC via Steam.

We've been lucky enough to go hands-on with the upcoming Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition on Switch, and as part of that, we thought it might be useful to see just how the new release stacks up next to the Wii U original.
In short, the Switch remaster represents a significant step up in overall visual quality. We've got big improvements on character models, lighting, resolution, and even a slightly fancier main menu. We'd expected a nice little upgrade, but some of the enhancements here are perhaps closer to something like Metroid Prime Remastered than, say, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed allows players to freely shape their own playstyle and tale in a world where every choice matters. But does the game have romance options, or does it approach the subject in the same vein as other recent Obsidian titles?


To help you find your Envoy's soulmate and get that healthy dose of romance many consider to be a must in any RPG, here are all of the romance options in Avowed and how to romance them.


All Romance Options in Avowed, explained


Although the game seems to follow a similar approach as The Other Worlds, where you are free to deepen your bond with select party members but unable to cross the line during a playthrough, Avowed does allow you to romance a single character, Kai. 


The romance, however, only blossoms after the end of the story. You also don't have to w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft has officially confirmed that Disney Dreamlight Valley’s latest update, Tales of Agrabah, is arriving soon. Although we caught a glimpse at this update in a previous content roadmap, we now know that Princess Jasmine and Aladdin are coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley on February 26, 2025.




We initially learned about Princess Jasmine and Aladdin’s update through DDV’s October 2024 Showcase, revealing a 2025 free content roadmap that included their arrival in “Early 2025.” While this didn’t specify a month, it suggested we’d see them sometime between January and March. Though Gameloft didn’t reveal much more after, their latest video showcases everything, from a new realm to its release date.

As revealed through an official DDV character announcement, Tales of Agrabah will feature a new realm where you’ll meet Jasmine and Aladdin. However, the realm is in disarray, so it’ll be up to you to work with them to restore Agrabah to its former glory. Maybe Jafar’s influence in Rift in Time is carrying over to this realm, too.


The Tales of Agrabah update also comes with Aladdin’s flying carpet as a new companion and a Gem Stall once you advance through Aladdin’s friendship questline. There’s no word yet on whether we’re getting new cooking recipes, but knowing previous updates, we’ll likely see a few related to Agrabah’s cuisine. As usual, we’ll be able to invite both Jasmine and Aladdin to Dreamlight Valley as we finish their realm’s quests, but the details of what this entails are still unknown.


Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Tales of Agrabah update is arriving on February 26, 2025.

Wordle was created by a single developer, a software engineer named Josh Wardle, in June 2021. The rules are easy to digest: players get six tries to guess a five-letter word. If a letter is in its correct spot, it turns green. If the letter is in the word but out of place, it turns yellow. And if the letter isn't in the answer, it turns black.


The game's simplistic rules paired well with its interface: a five-by-six grid of 30 individual squares laid against a black background. He made Wordle for his partner, who loved word games, as something for them to enjoy together. He soon showed it to family and friends, too, and it became a staple amongst …]]></summary>

Devolver Digital's publishing label Big Fan Games and developer Shiny Shoe have today announced that Monster Train 2 — a sequel to the 2021 deckbuilding roguelike — will be choo-chooing its way onto Switch later this year.
Much like its predecessor, this one will see you building up a deck of cards and using the abilities therein to take on foes in three-floor battles. The sequel boasts heaps of new card types, Clans, enemy factions and more, in a fresh story about teaming up Heaven and Hell to take down the Titans — no pressure then, eh?

It's also possible that the pizza I've just made in the demo for Moves Of The Diamond Hand is infectious, though I have invested all my points into the cooking skill, so hopefully not. You should be able to play the demo yourself by the time you read this. It's one for Betrayal At Club Low fans, taking the failure-is-fun dice rolling RPG systems from that, spicing them up, and letting you properly explore freely in first person this time. I first-personed my way straight to the nearest pizza shop. It almost literally killed my character, but I have baked a pie, and now I feel like a god.

This one is all about boosting the beat 'em up gameplay, with a new skill point system letting you upgrade your chosen Ranger, 'Morphers' to modify each run, and a handful of new moves so you can take it to Rita's minions in style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Skell of a good time.
It's been absolutely ages since we last set foot on Mira, the planet on which humanity seeks refuge from an alien threat in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It was perhaps only a year or two after the game first released on Wii U, in fact, that we last played it, and our overriding memory (besides the fact that it's incredible) is of an experience that needed to be unshackled, at a fundamental level, from hardware that was holding it back.
Now, it's not like Xenoblade Chronicles X was a mess or anything like that. It ran at a locked 30fps, as far as we recall, and it looked amazing, but it was a slice of sci-fi that often felt muddy, hard to read, and unwieldy when it shouldn't. The sort of game that was crying out for a great big resolution bump so we could enjoy its gorgeous locations in full, at the very least.

It garnered an estimated $136 million in January. So naturally, it's time to start laying people off. 


Last night, one of the project's game directors, Thaddeus Sasser, revealed that an undisclosed number of US-based NetEase Games employees had been dismissed, including level designers Gary McGee and Jack Burrows. NetEase have now confirmed the news, calling it a move to "optimize development efficiency" and assuring players that they "are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game". Just not so much the people working on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains moderate spoilers for the closing events of the Wedding Crashers quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

It’s impossible, I think, to play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 without playing a boozer, even if you’re only boozing in cutscenes. The game’s 15th century world is greased by many splendours of hooch, from the wine used in potion-brewing through the finer vintages at banqueting tables to the viral pondwater they sell in seedier taverns. A lot of the time, the writing views alcohol as a means of teeing up some slapstick debauchery reminiscent of Paul Bettany’s character in A Knight’s Tale. It venerates the spectacle of having a large one, with custom dialogue and voice-acting for protagonist Henry when you woozily explain your antics to guards. But sometimes, perhaps despite itself, it expresses something about the culture of drinking and the unpleasantness of being militantly exhorted to drink.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The psychology of people who cheat in competitive games remains deeply mysterious to me, but I'll hazard a guess it stems from a love of ruining someone's day rather than any real sense of accomplishment. Something I am interested in, however, is the idea of play as transgression.
There is, for example, a subset of people who get very irritated at the concept of speedruns. I suspect this is because, even if we aren't consciously engaged with a game's story, there's an underlying sense of what I'm going to very clumsily call 'narrative correctness' that's absolutely shattered when, say, Leon Kennedy starts shuffling up stairs at superhuman speeds. Glitches, warps, and other exploits expose the shroud of storytelling conjured by every little piece of a game's design, pulling off the mask so the underlying grey box is painfully visible. They call art a liar.
Competitive FPS Cheaters Cheetah initially seems like pure transgression against any sense of fair play or even level design, but the key here is that everyone gets cheats like aimbots, wallhacks, and spinbots. "This creates a unique dynamic," reads the game's Steam page, "where everyone knows everyone else's position, leading to intense mind games and thrilling battles". It sounds like it's either going to be a complete disaster or incredibly interesting, probably both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[War Rats is sort of trash, but I love it all the same. Oh, you're giving me a 'ratvolver' and letting me build 'turrats' and there's a dramatic close-up of swinging rat balls in the intro montage for each stage? Yeah, go on then. It's got the vibes of something made by the guy you knew in secondary school who exclusively drew pictures of cartoon dicks but, like, they were undeniably really good dicks. Absolute cock prodigy, that guy. Pablo Dickasso.
Anyway, I'm probably making it sound like there's a serious dick to rat ratio here but it's really just those balls. There are some great rat animations though. It's a 2D strategy tug-of-war where you push through stages summoning troops and building structures, and when you do, you're treated to a bunch of rats with hammers piling up construction barriers. When enemy rats fall, either to your own guns or your army of Ratineeers, gangs of regular-sized rats come to nibble on their corpses. They also say things like "Tell my wife…squeak".
Also I am 95% sure your Ratvolver fires legally distinct warpstone. They saw me coming, I tell you.

These mini tins are no novelty for a TCG expansion. They contain two booster packs and a collectible coin and retail for £10.99, tidy. The problem is that GAME is adding a bulky £19.99 "Oversized delivery" fee on top of that, making the overall purchase a little less 'mini' than the name suggests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After admitting it deliberately blocked Cloudflare to prevent a pirate IPTV service reaching users in Spain, LaLiga warned it would continue for as long as necessary to prevent live sports piracy. With thousands of innocent website owners and internet users suffering as collateral damage, a new LaLiga announcement reveals that two additional pirate IPTV providers with 400,000 local users have also been blocked, again by blocking Cloudflare. Charts and graphs produced by internet users leave little to the imagination.

They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.
Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii made me smile a lot, but I think the folks at RGG need to take a break for a few years. Watch some films. Have some cocktails. Get inspired again, y'know? Just as the high seas are the refuge of displaced Yakuza or insolvent scoundrels in this minigame-stuffed brawler-RPG, the game feels like the last port of call for a studio scraping the bottom of the grog barrel.
I smiled a lot, mind. It's hard not to with Majima back; moisturised, flourishing, driving a six-inch tanto knife into a man's kidneys for being mildly rude to him on the beach, and abducting monkeys for his petting zoo. He's also the captain of a pirate ship now, having woken on a strange island with no memory of his Yakuza past, but the same sense of fair play and manic flair for theatrical shankings. Plus, he's already got the eyepatch sorted.
Why are there actual, cannon-wielding, tricorn-headed pirates off the coast of Hawaii? Shhh. Just get on the boat. You do find the idea of a Majima being a pirate entertaining enough on its own to last you twenty five hours, don't you? I hope so, because this shorter side entry in the series isn't so much lean as it is thin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really, really like Is This Seat Taken? It might just be that this logic puzzler sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.
You've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. "I want to sit with Bob". "I need a window seat". "I forgot to shower". "I do not like bad smells". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.

This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in GTA 5.

Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with "O Muse". BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 


Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform Amphora Hell, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. "No evidence of my failure must remain," he bellows in the Itch preamble. "Prepare to be scrapped!"

As such, I'm not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too. A new blog post outlines the changes they're making to AI, and there's an experimental beta branch available right now if you want to test them out.

It often feels as if video games take the opposite approach, gleefully piling tropes high upon their back like Labyrinth's junk lady. Sure, they sacrifice the opportunity to say anything affecting or which feels true, but presumably the theory is that reminding you of a dozen other films, TV shows, books and games you like is just as good.

Enter Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, hunched over from the weight of all the teen TV shows and young adult novels stacked atop its shoulders.

The indictment offers detail on when the men first met, when their plans for Fmovies began to take shape, and how the site generated revenue. Last year the MPA described the shutdown as a "stunning victory." New revelations are indeed stunning, but extremely puzzling too.

Perhaps they're gracefully devouring a seal's carcass, or moving to escape a lethal descending finger of ice. Look, I'm quite a morbid guy, but 'beauty of nature' and all that.


It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to harvest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. 
You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.

It’s the sad, sleepy tale of a musician, Rama, who is trying to put his life back together and reconnect with his old bandmates in Jakarta a year after the death of his girlfriend, Cinta. The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game's 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen.

I hope said test provided FromSoft with some helpful data, considering Nightreign releases in May, though it would have been a lot easier for everyone if I could’ve just sent Hidetaka Miyazaki an email saying "Sir, your server infrastructure is made of biscuits."
In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something uncanny about dipping "classic" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.

Behold Dawnfolk - a pixelart fantasy town grower packed full of minigames that describes itself as "charmingly dark and minimalist", much like a potential hook-up on some highbrow dating service.

When they got hold of detailed audience data for Civilization 6, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, Sid Meier's Civilization VII's new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.

Sometimes a blossoming genre can be obvious, as when a huge success like Doom or Dark Souls comes along and inspires games for decades to follow. But sometimes a new genre is quiet, low-key, hiding just beneath the surface of a tumultuous industry. Sometimes you have to go fishing for it.

This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla Elden Ring. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro and Bloodborne reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.

It’s easy to lose moments watching the ambience of the gameboard change in the demo for haunted house RPG The Horror At Highrook. The colours alter from daytime greyness through winey shades of sunset into pale lavender moonlight. There are little details to notice and zoom on: a fleeting embroidery of rain, the seep of flames in the kitchen and guest rooms, a fidgeting of moths in the archives. Ah, nice. The last time I felt so beguiled by a view of a house was while looking out from the hamlet of Darkest Dungeon.

Happily, Avowed does at least launch in much better shape, and with some genuinely fetching fantasy visuals that may even justify flicking on ray tracing. The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to "come hither" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime action game Stellar Blade has been confirmed for PC release in June 2025. Developed by South Korean studio Shift Up and published by Sony, it's about fighting monsters on post-apocalyptic Earth by means of combos, parries and gauge-based super moves. It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It's also got a protagonist we can summarise as Bayonetta played straight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. Asteroid 2024 YR4 loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.


If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

Film Captain America: Nový svět (který má v úvodních titulcích pouze "Brave New World" a žádného Captaina) je pravděpodobně začátkem nové filmové megasérie, která nám v příštích filmech pravděpodobně představí "nové" Avengers, nové X-Men a pravděpodobně také nové multiverzní nebezpečí. Píšu několikrát "pravděpodobně", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).

Remedy's exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game engine company Unity are making yet another round of job cuts across various departments, from software development to advertising. They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as "completely abrupt and impersonal". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BeIN, Miramax and MPA-affiliated anti-piracy group AVIA, have called out a Chinese company behind a device that disables anti-piracy codes embedded in video streams. Gotech was previously hit with a widely publicized $101m judgment following a Nagravision copyright lawsuit. Yet, not only was the amount never paid, the judgment was fully vacated. In what can only be described as a bizarre finale,  GoTech now promotes Nagra as its partner.

Relic's new corporate partners are a holding company established by the UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP - an arrangement that apparently lets them operate like an independent studio, though I'm fuzzy on the moving parts.

Most likely by design, the enforcement action coincided with the Super Bowl. While the seizures may have frustrated many 'pirate' viewers, pirate streaming operations are not necessarily throwing in the towel just yet.

As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well. Let's commence feeding the Maw and hope that we strike a few sparks of amore from the creature's heaving flanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels are "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game", according to a report by Bloomberg. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

But here’s the thing: it's basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion).

It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. "I don't know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench's games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever," responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.
