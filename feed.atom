[Featured Image Source: Thibault Miniou on ArtStation]
If you’ve read any of my features in the past, you’re probably well aware that I didn’t seriously get into games until I was in college. I had some consoles when I was younger, like a PS2, a Game Boy Advance SP, a Nintendo DS, and a Wii, but pretty much all of the games I played were “girly” horse-related, Barbie, or licensed Disney Channel spin-off games.
I had a great time with those games (which have merit in their own right), but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed in retrospect that I missed out on some of the all-time greats. The good news is, now I’m an adult with my own time and money, and I’m fortunate enough to have a job centered around games — which means I can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In bird culture, this is considered a Jack Move.
It feels like most JRPGs these days don’t really tread much into hard science fiction. Sure, big franchises like Final Fantasy or Xenoblade aren’t afraid to mix in some tech alongside their magic, but it’s rare that you’ll see developers fully commit to a world that’s all robots and computers. In this regard, Jack Move is a breath of fresh air. What we have here is a brief, well-paced, and thoroughly traditional JRPG set in a cyberpunk universe. It's surprisingly innovative and a delight to play through.
Jack Move takes place in a near-future, cyberpunk society where governments are effectively impotent and enormous conglomerates reign supreme. You take on the role of Noa, a chipper hacker who routinely participates in attacks on corporations and sells sensitive information on the black market. Noa and her partner-in-crime, Ryder, are simply carrying on with business as usual when she receives a message from her estranged father, who warns her that a corporation called Monomind may be after her because of something he’s been working on. Shortly after this, Monomind kidnaps her dad, starting Noa and Ryder on a quest to free him and get to the bottom of his latest research project.

Hey folks, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing?

*deep breath* There was a Nintendo Direct this week! And it was chock-a-block full of games. But the big news is that we, at last, know the name (and release date) of Breath of the Wild's follow-up. RIP The Sequel to... The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a lot less of a mouthful, to be honest. And that box art is... well, art.
Other Direct highlights include Pikmin 4 actually, really existing, a brand new Fire Emblem game with a toothpaste-haired protagonist, and Octopath Traveler II bringing more HD-2D goodness to the Switch.

Hello hello! Tonight we're taking the role of a defense lawyer who must investigate crimes and defend our clients in court. Self-described as "potentially the hottest bird lawyering game to come out of 1840s France," Aviary Attorney is clearly a very Ace Attorney-flavored game, which we all know as iconic and tons of fun. There are three possible endings, all "drastically different," casting a new light on the main characters as they discover what justice means.

After our first stream last Friday, I can confirm Aviary Attorney is very witty and comical.
I like that the cases have details that matter, lines where you may need to remember some very early clues, and a (sometimes frustrating) time limit to find them; so it's a fun challenge to remember everything and put the clues to use. The characters are full of personality with unique dialogue and I'm really enjoying it.
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of this week's announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

Legacies are not forged in the way a merc lives in Night City, but how they die. This idea permeates through both the game Cyberpunk 2077, and the newly released Netflix anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
The runners don’t lead a corpo life. They don’t get Platinum insurance with the Trauma Team. They’re not trying to secure their soul. Everyone is running from, or towards, something. And everyone runs until they can’t anymore. It's this universal pursuit of more that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners dives deep on, to great success.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …]]></summary>

There's also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that's available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

Nintendo said that they were going to give us a Direct aimed mostly at "games releasing this winter," and they extended beyond the reaches of 2022 this time around. While a packed January and February are now in the cards, we got some insight all the way up through May, with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now this handy Nintendo infographic provides a full picture of what's to come with 2022 Switch games into 2023.
The updated infographic comes straight from Nintendo's Twitter account, which leads off with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then very smoothly leads with first-party games. We have Pikmin 4 finally confirmed for 2023, as well as a new Fire Emblem and a Kirby remaster. The recently-released Splatoon 3 and the Xenoblade Chronicles 3/Mario Kart 8 Deluxe season passes are included too. In the near future for first-party 2022 Switch games, Bayonetta 3 and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope are arriving in October, with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet ending the year in November with what will certainly be a big splash, sales-wise.
Third parties aren't left out either, as several Switch ports are given time to shine (like It Takes Two, Sifu, and Tunic), mixed in with remakes like Front Mission 1st and Front Mission 2. You can check everything out in the image below, or watch the Direct for yourself. Or check out our recap!
2023 is gearing up to be a triumphant return for many studios following copious amounts of delays; but folks who partake in multiple platforms have a ton left to look forward to, even as the year comes to a close.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current gen titles to sport top-tier prices
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that the publisher is to adopt a $70 USD price tag for all of its major releases going forward. The new price point, which is fast becoming industry standard, will be applicable to all of the publisher's "AAA" titles.
Speaking in a recent interview with Axios, Guillemot noted that the price change was in-line with other publishers in the industry that have also decided to add a further $10 to the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of their biggest releases, particularly for current platforms such as PS5 and Xbox Series X. The first Ubisoft title to release at the new price will be the current-gen edition of Skull & Bones — scheduled to launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X in November. Future releases such as the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage are also expected to adopt the new pricing scheme.
While many will understandably groan at the inevitable price hike, Ubisoft is by far the first publisher to take this step, and is in fact one of the few outliers in this particular situation. 2K Games' NBA 2K20 was the first title to launch at $70 back in 2020. Other publishers, such as Activision, Sony, and Square Enix, would follow suit — putting out premium titles such as Returnal and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, even on the traditionally "cheaper" PC platform. Future blockbuster releases, such as the PS5 edition of God of War Ragnarok, are also expected to retail at the new price point.

Created by Michael Voeller and Jason Mojica, who have a combined 25 years of experience in the FPS genre, and with music from Andrew Hulsh (composer on DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods, Dusk, and Amid Evil), this feels like the throwback shooter we've been waiting for.

If you're a fan of farming/community sims, there is no shortage of awesome new games to try. One of them is Dreamlight Valley, Disney's answer to the Stardew Valley-inspired craze. In the game, you play as a character who finds themselves in a magical land in ruins after an event known as "The Forgetting" — which is just as ominous as it sounds. Players are tasked with ridding the land of the insidious night thorns, as well as doing the usual fare for these kinds of games: farming, fishing, cooking, mining, digging, and filling requests for the townspeople (who also happen to be beloved Disney characters).
The siren song of another cozy simulator game is enough to draw out gamers in droves, but add on the juggernaut that is the Disney brand? Yeah, it's no surprise that this game is seeing the success that it is. So much success, in fact, that Dreamlight Valley has managed to accrue over a million players only ten short days after its release.

Dreamlight Valley was developed by Gameloft, which has been notable in the mobile market for decades. This certainly isn't their first wider release for consoles, but I think it's fair to say that this is the studio's most notable release so far.
I'd consider myself to be a casual Disney fan, but this is a game I certainly can't wait to try for myself. The idea of seeing a bunch of my favorite characters in a game genre I already go out of my way to play as much as possible, well, that's just something I can't resist.
From the classic characters like Mickey and Donald all the way up to new characters like Elsa and Moana, the roster is pretty stacked. All I had to hear was that the Tangled characters were included to know I was on board.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top of the Plops
Nintendo's colorful sequel Splatoon 3 is now out in the wild and is already proving to be an absolute smash hit. The wacky arena shooter has not only sold over three million copies in its home territory Japan, but has also debuted in the top spot of the UK Charts.
This feat represents the first time that the Splatoon series has held the premier position and, as one of the few major Nintendo franchises not to find itself on the throne, is a particularly notable event. Previous entries Splatoon (2015) and Splatoon 2 (2017) both reached the still impressive No.2 slot, but were held off by CDPR's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Activision's Crash Bandicoot: N.Sane Trilogy, (which long-term readers will remember was a UK No.1 for infinity billion years.)
Splatoon 3, which launched on Nintendo Switch a mere four days ago, is already proving to be one of Nintendo's best-selling titles of 2022 in the UK, as well as one of the fastest-selling Switch releases ever. Once again, the messy multiplayer release sees teams of players battle it out in turf war-based combat — utilizing an array of ridonkulous weaponry and unique special abilities in order to win the day.
Splatoon 3 is set against a (slightly) more industrial backdrop than its predecessors — fallout from the final splatfest of Splatoon 2 favoring "Chaos" over "Order."

The best thing about publisher Microids is its utter devotion to dice-rollin' retro reveals — One minute it's Tuesday, and then, BAM!, Denver the Last Dinosaur battle royale. Today's bizarre surprise comes in the form of a VR remake of Taito classic Operation: WOLF, coming to PC and consoles in 2022.

Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission is a reimagining of the legendary 1987 rail shooter, which sees hardy Green Beret Roy Adams embark on a do-or-die mission behind enemy lines to rescue a group of hapless hostages, held captive by some evil force that isn't America. The remake will tweak the characters, locations, and objectives of the coin-op classic, but promises to retain the trigger-pumping, quarter-guzzling action that made the original such a smash over three decades ago.

First Mission will feature a one-or-two-player story campaign, a wide arsenal of explosive weaponry, and a frenzied survival mode, alongside new enemies, stages, and cutscenes. No trailer was released for the title but screenshots have been made available for player perusal. I see the soldiers and the helicopters, but as of yet no hapless nurses, cats, or blatant Schwarzenegger rip-offs. We'll get there.
Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission launches on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch in 2022. A Meta edition is planned for 2023.

With the obvious heavy hitter Zelda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation owners won't miss out on Silksong
A small piece of Hollow Knight: Silksong news has dropped in today. The long-awaited Hollow Knight follow-up will be coming to PlayStation platforms.
Team Cherry has been gradually adding platforms to the lineup for Silksong. PC and Nintendo Switch are on the docket, and Team Cherry confirmed a few months ago that Silksong is also headed to Xbox Game Pass.
With PlayStation's reveal, it now seems like everyone will get a chance to get in on the new Hollow Knight game when it arrives.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1570797280063627264
The Game Pass reveal, along with this, is also the latest news we've had on Hollow Knight: Silksong. The long-awaited title is still in development, with no date locked in quite yet.
All that being said, though, the sleek needle-and-thread action of Silksong has looked pretty great in every showing. Here's the latest trailer, as an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSfuFlhsxZY
Good things for those who wait
It's hopefully not too much longer before we get some official details on Silksong's debut. Considering how much folks loved the original Hollow Knight, it's got some big shoes to fill.
Of course, there have been some quite solid action exploration games, or Metroidvanias, in the gap between. Last year's Axiom Verge 2, a sequel to the excellent Axiom Verge, springs to mind.
Fans really want the dark hollows and armored bugs, though, ever since its reveal as a fully-fledged follow-up in 2019.
Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox, PC, and Switch sometime in the future.

Like any genre, lo-fi horror carries with it the possibility of growing stale. You can only be locked in a house with a killer so many times before it’s routine. It’s not always that way, however. There are lots of alternatives. Night at the Gates of Hell makes a big detour for the genre by empowering you with a gun. The zombies are slow, and ammo is limited. Aim for the head.
It certainly helps that it marks the return of the duo that created Bloodwash, which still stands as one of my favorite examples of the genre. Jordan King and Henry Hoare have returned with some extra ammunition, this time giving us all the zombies we can handle. It’s a rather stark departure from Bloodwash’s thick and heavy suspense, but it’s substantial proof that these two k…]]></summary>

The dream is almost here — we're just over a month away from Persona 5 Royal's release on Switch. This much-begged-for port sees the expanded, tuned-up version of the original Persona 5 make its way over to Nintendo's hybrid console, alongside Xbox and PlayStation 5. And budding Phantom Thieves can get pre-ordering right now.
Atlus has shared details of a newly-announced Limited Edition, appropriately named the '1 More Edition'. 1 More is a series-staple mechanic, which allows the player to take another turn if they hit the enemy with a weakness — or a boss with an environmental attack in Persona 5. Or perhaps it's just a reference to the fact that you might want "just one more" special edition of Persona 5?

I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

As we approach the release date of Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the online action game where you can play as multiple Dragon Ball characters from different arcs, Bandai Namco has shared a brand new trailer for the game, showcasing a few more new characters. And it looks like Bamco is embracing the weird and wonderful world of the manga and anime.
Even if you're not that familiar with the Dragon Ball Z anime, in particular, you've probably seen screenshots of a farmer with a shotgun. What if we told you he will also be playable in The Breakers? Madness? Nope! You'll be able to play as the man who met Raditz in the Raditz Saga's opening episode. With a power level of 5 — which surely makes him the most powerful farmer? — he's appeared in numerous cameos throughout the multimedia franchise, including an appearance in Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. The Farmer will be a Survivor character in the upcoming game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Just try and look surprised)
Capcom has officially confirmed the 18-character launch roster of its upcoming sequel Street Fighter 6 — as revealed by the leak earlier this year, the launch roster is a mix of classic, modern, and brand new World Warriors, pulled from the history of the Street Fighter franchise as well as its future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaOSVtH4r8Q
Your Street Fighter 6 launch roster is as follows: Luke, Jamie, Manon, Kimberly, Marisa, Lily, JP, Juri, Dee Jay, Cammy, Ryu, E. Honda, Blanka, Guile, Ken, Chun-Li, Zangief, and last, but by no means least, Dhalsim. Of no surprise to anybody, Capcom also confirmed post-release DLC for the new sequel. Missing from this list, but included in the leak, are Ed, Akuma, AKI, and Rashid.
Street Fighter 6 launches in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can sign up for October's Closed Beta right here. Additionally, be sure to check out yesterday’s news, and this morning's updates, as well as our other reports on the game’s mechanics, our look at Juri and Kimberly, and a list of Do’s and Do Not Do’s for the new sequel.

In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

A massive Splatoon 3 patch just dropped, and it has implications for multiplayer, as well as the Tricolor Battle system (which will impact future Splatfests). Let's dig in, because there's a lot to unpack.
On a technical level, some bugs were fixed, including a Squid Roll exploit, as well as bugs like interactions with water, and general multiplayer connection problems. Matchmaking has been a contentious thing for some, and ideally this patch should smooth things over. A small story mode bug was addressed too, as well as connection and technical issues with Salmon Run.
But the big focus here is the "Tricolor Battle," the new mode that features three teams duking it out at once. As a lot of folks experienced with the free Splatfest demo (rock, paper, scissors)…]]></summary>

One of the biggest reveals from the September Nintendo Direct – other than the grand reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, of course – was Fire Emblem Engage. This brand new game in the series is headed to Switch next January and there's a lovely Divine Edition release on the way too.
Pre-orders for both the Divine Edition and the standard physical release for the game are now live at a number of retailers. Stock for the Divine Edition is already selling out at major stores (we're hoping they'll get more stock listed over the coming weeks and months), so you might want to get an order in for that one pretty sharpish.

Odyssey Interactive is officially revealing its first title. It's a fast-paced competitive game that mixes sports, MOBA, and more called Omega Strikers.
The new three-on-three "knockout striker," as Odyssey describes it, is a free-to-play and cross-platform competitive game. It's launching a closed beta on PC via Steam today, and will launch on mobile later this year, with a console release aiming for sometime in 2023.
But what is Omega Strikers? The best description might be that it's like if soccer, League of Legends, and physics-based fighters like Smash Bros. all blended into one new genre.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!]]></summary>

Now, as expected, it appears as though Sakurai's videos are already being utilised in game development lectures. Not particularly surprising in itself, but we must admit, we weren't quite expecting them to show up just yet. The first has been shared by artist @JokarioArt via Automaton; the individual is sat in a game-making class during which the lecturer proceeds to demonstrate one of Sakurai's videos - the one on creating realistic trees, if you want to know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 'Magic' season for Switch b-ball.
It's once again reached that time of year when another entry in the NBA 2K franchise slam-dunks onto our consoles. Yes, it's sometimes difficult to muster much excitement for these annual instalments, and it's easy to dismiss them as just another incremental update that looks and plays almost identically to the previous season's effort. However, NBA 2K23 is worth getting a little more jazzed about than usual, as it combines an excellent new Michael Jordan Challenge mode with, what we reckon, is the best on-court action we've seen from the series thus far, even if this Switch port has had to make some cuts here and there.
Let's kick things off with that new Michael Jordan Challenge mode, which feels like a fully fleshed-out and richly rewarding part of the game. Here you'll take part in 15 specific challenges based on events from across MJ's career, with each and every one of them presented in exacting detail, featuring era-specific stadiums, kits, commentary and screen filters that give the whole thing a delightfully aged look. This is no throwaway mode, it's a full-on history lesson to sink your teeth into that really brings MJ's early career and biggest NBA moments back to life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch
Today, as part of the TGS festivities, Konami has revealed the Suikoden I & II HD Remaster project for PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It's due out in 2023, and will pack in both games under the "Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars" moniker.
As for what's actually remastered, Konami touts "HD background illustrations, updated pixel art, new environmental sound effects, an auto-save feature, a battle fast-forward mechanic, a conversation log, and extra HD battle effects." The trailer also shows that moving diagonally is possible. This might excite some hardcore fans, too: "All character portraits have been updated in HD. Junko Kawano, who designed the characters for the original version of Suikoden released in 1995, has newly re-drawn all the character portraits for Suikoden I HD Remaster Gate Rune War."
This is seemingly the reveal that Konami had teased for TGS from a storied franchise. It actually has a Steam page up now if you want to peruse some more info. I mean, while this isn't huge news to some, it's great news for Suikoden fans. Not only do they have another cheaper option to play these two Suikoden games, but there's also the whole Eiyuden Chronicle spiritual successor series, which currently has one released game and another one planned.
Sadly, the rest of the Konami TGS presentation was filled with a sleepy series of Yu-Gi-Oh presentations, as well as brief looks at Super Bomberman R 2, Cygni: All Guns Blazing (a shmup they showed off a few weeks ago), and eFootball (the series formerly known as Pro Evolution Soccer, or PES). The Suikoden I & II HD Remaster was pretty much all they had to show!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a "GeForce Beyond" show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami has revealed Suikoden I & II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here's hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game's Steam page:

The Steam Deck is widely known for its remarkable emulation capabilities, with users most recently managing to enable gyro controls for Wii U emulation. It's not entirely surprising when you consider that the Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC, but it's still impressive nonetheless.
Now, one Reddit user has taken things to the next level by creating what is essentially a 3DS on steroids. In a video posted on the Steam Deck subreddit, user u/rising_tony demonstrates how they have loosely modded the Steam Deck by clipping on an additional screen to allow for fully authentic 3DS emulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It runs through September 25
Koei Tecmo has surprise-released a limited-time Wo Long demo, amid a current presence on the TGS showfloor.
There's two caveats here. Yes, limited time means limited time, as you'll get a little over a week to play the demo. The open testing period begins now, and will run through September 25: at that point access to the demo will be pulled. Also, as is customary, you can earn a bonus item for the full game after completing the demo. In this case, it's an item called the "Crouching Dragon Helmet."
Here's a rundown of the Wo Long demo from Koei Tecmo: "The demo version of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, an action RPG set in a dark fantasy Three Kingdoms world. As a nameless militia soldier in the chaotic Three Kingdoms world, the player will face demons and officers using swordplay based on Chinese martial arts. By clearing this demo version, players will be able to obtain a Crouching Dragon Helmet that can be used in the retail version."
Following the demo, in classic Team Ninja fashion, there's also going to be an online survey to tell the team what you think. They always make changes for future demos and the full version based on these surveys, so make it count. Oh, you also need to be online to play the demo, but you don't need a paid online membership.

Xbox Series X/S

Put this one on the record as "something we weren't expecting" — Microids has announced that it will be releasing Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, which is an officially licensed "new vision" for Tatio's Operation Wolf series, which started on the NES back in 1987. The original was followed by three sequels, Operation Thunderbolt in 1998, Operation Wolf 3 in 1994, and Operation Tiger in 1998.
Operation Wolf was an on-rails light gun shooter which was one of the most popular arcade titles back in the '80s, and Microids is continuing the series' legacy. You'll be able to play Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission either solo or co-op, but one thing we're hoping for is the use of motion controls so we can use our Joy-Cons to aim and take down enemies.

It will feature new racer and kart elements, but the long-standing Kangaroo version of Yoshi takes centre stage with the new trailer; we don't blame it - it looks just adorable.

PC Specs
With the exciting news of an incoming Closed Beta on all platforms, Capcom has seen fit to release some preliminary PC specifications in order to check that your rig is ready for all the ruckus. As Street Fighter 6 will also be released on last-gen platforms, the minimum spec required is relatively low, while medium specification recommends a fairly meaty modern rig.

There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FINALLY.
Officially announced at the Tokyo Game Show, Suikoden I and Suikoden II are finally returning. And not just with a simple port of both games, as they're both getting the HD remaster treatment. Suikoden I & II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification, a double-pack of the first two games in the series, will be coming to Switch in 2023. And they're confirmed for an English release.
Released on the PlayStation in 1995 and 1998 respectively, Suikoden I and II are often considered two of the best JRPGs on the system. This is the first "game" to bear the Suikoden name since the Japanese PSP exclusive Gensō Suikoden: Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki in 2012, and the HD remasters will be coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam too. The series' most-famous aspect is that you can recruit 108 Stars of Destiny, who will either become party members to use in battles or allies to assist you at your base, which you can build up over the course of the game.

The magic and wonder of Outer Wilds gets a nice upgrade for newer console owners today. Outer Wilds and its DLC Echoes of the Eye are out now on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a free upgrade for owners on previous-gen consoles.
The space exploration adventure will run at native 60 FPS on the new hardware, with 4K support. That's a whole lot of beautiful space pixels to blast into your eyes.
If you own the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One already, you can upgrade within your respective console family at no cost. Just use your respective digital storefront, either PlayStation or Xbox, to bump it up.
Otherwise, Outer Wilds is currently available for $24.99, with the Echoes of the Eye DLC running $14.99, or $39.99 for a bundled package. It's also on Game Pass, as of this writing.

A universe full of wonders
If you haven't played Outer Wilds yet, then good heavens, what are you waiting for? This time-looping space exploration game, developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive, is an incomparable experience.
When I was recently thinking about the kinds of stories you can only tell in games, Outer Wilds was one of the first to come to mind. It is warm and sentimental, cold and haunting, and expertly crafts its mysteries and story in the span of one galaxy.

Its DLC expansion, Echoes of the Eye, is even more of the same. I think the base game hit me harder, as I knew what I was getting into once I booted up Echoes. But the trees, lights, and hidden puzzles of that place stick with me.
With the PS5 and Xbox Series upgrade out and free for anyone who's already picked the game up, this seems like a great excuse to dive back into Outer Wilds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due out in 2023
Thanks to a new Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty dev diary TGS trailer, we have a better look at how Team Ninja is approaching this "masocore" (their words) action game.
Fumihiko Yasuda (producer) speaks on how when he was pondering the future of the Nioh series, he "started to consider a worldview separate from Sengoku-era Japan," and drew upon his personal love of the stories of the Three Kingdoms era. A story "based around Chinese martial arts" was a good fit to convey this idea, and was a perfect way to differentiate a new project from Nioh.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will portray the "turbulence" of the era, with a heavy focus on the concept of the "dark world," which will likely aim for a baseline intense experience. The "fluidity of speed" is a goal for the combat system, and we get to see a brief look at the upcoming character creation menu. Variation between players in an online setting was used as one reason for avatar customization, as well as a focus on a "historical story," rather than a personal one.
Team Ninja is busy, as they also have Rise of the Ronin in the works, which also has Yasuda involved as a director (though we'll have to understandably wait until 2024 for that one). As someone who watched Team Ninja walk, then run, then falter, I'm just glad they're back in the mix again.
At this point with several recent universally-liked projects under their belt, new announcements are met with glee rather than a groan. There was a rough patch there capped off by Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, but they really counterbalanced that with Hyrule Warriors that same year, into reestablishing dominance with Nioh three years later.

        <updated>2022-09-15T22:00:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've got until September 21
As we inch closer and closer to the looming 1.0 launch of Vampire Survivors, fans are getting antsy, myself included. Today's morsel is just a "minor patch," but there's important news for folks on the sidelines: a price increase is coming soon.
At just three dollars, Vampire Survivors is some of the best bang-for-your-buck gaming I've ever experienced. And while typically Early Access titles wait until their full launch to raise prices, in this case, the game will cost more starting on September 21. The 1.0 launch is coming later — we'll learn the full release date in two weeks, on September 29.
The creator, poncle, explained this choice. "To be frank, it's because otherwise I'd mess up the sales calendar for the rest of the year. I want to keep the option open to eventually enter some of the usual seasonal sales, and increasing the price on v1.0 launch day would mess up the timings, as price changes also comes with a temporary price freeze."
Players have become so absorbed with the game's monster-exploding grind and fun unlockables that they've actually asked — sometimes jokingly, but often for real — for Vampire Survivors to charge more. I got my money's worth early on, and the updates just kept coming. I'm now at 55 hours on the clock. It's baffling when I stop and think about it.
Today's patch is a minor one
So, what's new in patch 0.11.3? Most notably, I'd point to Blood Astronomia (Arcana XXI), which emits "special damaging zones affected by Amount and Magnet" for weapons like Garlic and Song of Mana. There's also the MissingNo character, who has randomized stats and can now be "unlocked officially" — find the full instructions here on Reddit.
If you've thought about getting into Vampire Survivors, consider this your call to do so before the price jumps. I can easily see it hitting the $10-$15 range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is finally over
This has been a pretty awesome year for indie games, with titles like Cult of the Lamb, Immortality, and We Are OFK, just to name a few. One game has stuck with me since I reviewed it all the way back in March, and still remains one of my favorites to come out in 2022: the Southern Gothic narrative adventure NORCO that was "inspired by first-person pixel noirs like Déjà Vu & Snatcher and rooted in years of research," according to the game's creators. Set in a dystopian cyberpunk version of New Orleans, Louisiana, the game takes you on a journey through the infamous "Cancer Alley," an area of Mississippi that accounts for a quarter of the US's petrochemical production.
Now, the game's developer Geography of Robots has announced that NORCO is finally coming to consoles with a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One release on October 20. You can also play on Xbox Games Pass, if that suits your fancy. I obviously own NORCO on PC already, but I'm super excited for this release, because it means the game will be accessible to more players — and this game deserves all the hype it can get, if getting hype for old-school point-and-clicks is your thing.
https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1570188618647437312
A press release from publisher Raw Fury provides more in-depth details on the game:
"NORCO is the debut title from developer collective Geography of Robots. Lead creator Yuts was born and raised in Norco, Louisiana, an acronym for New Orleans Refining Co., located in the so-called 'Cancer Alley,' a stretch of the Mississippi that accounts for 1/4 of the US's petrochemical production. The game blends real locations, personal stories, and Southern Gothic literature with a captivating original soundtrack featuring a guest track by Southern metal Band THOU."
If you're at all interested in checking NORCO out on your favorite console, I can't recommend it enough!

One of the many things I love about the Zelda series is that each game has its own unique vibe — from the cartoony wholesomeness of Wind Waker to the downright spooky atmosphere of Majora’s Mask. Of course, I’m excited to see how the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, which we now know is called Tears of the Kingdom, will innovate on the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor, but even moreso, I’m pumped to see how the story of the world has changed since we last checked in with the Hylian hero.
When people ask me what my favorite video game stories are, they’re usually confused to hear that I add Breath of the Wild to that list. The game has minimal storytelling aside from the optional memories you can go around and find. What I think it does …]]></summary>

Blizzard is stepping in to clarify exactly how battle pass unlocks will work for the heroes of Overwatch 2.
After leaks of its model for the upcoming free-to-play multiplayer evolution of Overwatch got out, the studio is now detailing exactly how players will unlock heroes in the new game.
Overwatch 2 heads into free-to-play multiplayer on October 4. And as the game shifts into a seasonal content model, hero unlocks will also be part of the Battle Pass.
Loot boxes are going away, being replaced by an in-game shop and a virtual currency, Overwatch Coins. The shop will offer "featured cosmetic items every week" for all players. Season one will follow a cyberpunk theme, and other seasons will have their own themes as well.

Following its PS4 launch, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection PC release finally has a date straight from Sony: October 19. To re-summarize, Legacy of Thieves is a double-pack of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, with just the single player portions intact.
As detailed in a PlayStation Blog entry, Naughty Dog has partnered with Iron Galaxy for this port, which will feature "a reimagined UI, scale sliders, GPU and VRAM detection, Variable Load Speed, and so much more." DualSense controller and AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2 support are in too.
When it launches on PC, it'll be available on both the Steam and Epic marketplaces for $49.99. On the latter, it'll come with a Fortnite: "If you pre-purchase on Epic, you can take your adventure beyond land and sea with Sully’s 'New' Seaplane, an in-game Glider that you can use in Fortnite."
Alright then! I guess ignoring a Fornite bonus is going to be a lot easier to do than trying to ignore timed exclusivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guest appearances from some series veterans
Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have released the first gameplay trailer for their upcoming remake Like a Dragon: Ishin! — the slick video shows off some of the characters, locales, and intense combat action of the period piece spin-off from the much-loved Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk_z9hyFY1I&t
Originally released in Japan back in 2014 as Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin!, Sega's spin-off sees a suspiciously familiar party of heroes and villains clash against the backdrop of the latter-day Bakamatsu period of Edo-era Japan. Replacing the streets of Kamurocho with rural villages and ancient temples, the game follows the adventures of legendary swordsman and folklore figure Sakamoto Ryōma — essentially "portrayed" by Like a Dragon hero Kazuma Kiryu.
The new remake will feature an overhauled game engine, modern visuals, and tightened combat. In addition, a new "soldier" system will let the player call upon classic Like a Dragon characters for an assist in battle, including Like a Dragon 2's Kaoru Sayama and Like a Dragon 7's Ichiban Kasuga. As depicted in the trailer, fans can also expect a wide variety of dopey side activities, including some garden plantation, fishing, gambling, and, naturally, some Edo-era karaoke. Because why hot?
It might have been a very, very, very long time coming for western fans, but it looks like this new edition of the rare release is going to have been worth the wait. Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms February 21, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the most recent roadmap
Fresh off of launching The Pitt, Bethesda has reconfirmed the Fallout 76 December update timing in a new blog.
First, the team will celebrate the Fallout 25th anniversary starting on October 4. Those festivities will ring in bonus weekends (double mutations and caps-a-plenty), and the From Beyond/Halloween-themed Spooky Scorched seasonal events. The next month, starting on November 3, Community CAMP Creations are being celebrated, with more bonus weekends (this time they'll add double XP into the mix), and a legendary purveyor sale.
The main event though is in December, as the Nuka-World On Tour fully-fledged update will arrive, which brings in more content. Bethesda also confirms that it'll "reopen the Public Test Server for a new round of playtesting next month [October]." As a reminder, all of that takes place on Steam now with the shutdown of the Bethesda Launcher.
Here's the full rundown on the Fallout 76 December update - Nuka-World On Tour:
We have a story tease from Bethesda: "The Fizziest Show on Earth has kicked the irradiated dust off the tires and hit the road"
It'll feature new public events, as well as a region boss public event series
Nuka-World On Tour will kick off Season 11 (currently we're on Season 10 with The Pitt update, titled "The City of Steel")
Here's an up-to-date Fallout 76 2022 roadmap:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solving crimes with haymakers
In a surprisingly unceremonious piece of news, publisher Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have quietly ported detective thrillers Judgment and Lost Judgment onto PC. The two Judgment titles are now available to purchase via the Steam platform, priced at around $40 and $60 USD, respectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT6np8elumk
Judgment (2018) and its sequel Lost Judgment (2021), follows the adventures of lawyer-turned-private detective Takayuki Yagami, as he becomes embroiled in various escalating mysteries on the mean streets of Kamurocho — which just happen to be the setting for Ryu ga Gotoku Studio's flagship franchise, Like a Dragon. In the Judgment titles, players follow trails of evidence, interrogate perps, and solve minor and major crimes, more often than not at the end of a skinny-jeans-borne spin-kick.
Much like its Ryu Ga Gotoku brethren, the Judgment titles are renowned for their brutal martial arts combat, stylish nightlife settings, and abundance of dopey, tonally inconsistent mini-games and side activities. Both titles are solid, and well worth checking out if you've exhausted the Yakuza catalog and are looking for something to tide you over until the release of the just announced Like a Dragon 8.
Judgment and Lost Judgment are available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Stadia, and PC platforms.

During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall.

Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

How the turn tables have turned.
I'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies.

Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

        <updated>2022-09-15T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films," a press release reads. "The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom."
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass' free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko's Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokyo Game Show 2022 will run from Sept. 15 through Sept. 18, and Sega has helped kick off the event with a new Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they're mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far. It's also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. 
For more Sonic Frontiers, read about what you should expect from Sonic Frontiers' story and then read why one Game Informer editor says Sonic Frontiers is the first Sonic game he's actually wanted to play since Dreamcast. After that, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers cover story, which features exclusive details about the game you won't find anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.]]></summary>

Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it's called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020's Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo's digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack? Maybe you're super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can't talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you're most hyped about coming out of today's Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-13T23:50:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, and if you're at all familiar with Team Ninja's other games, you're probably going to be into this one. It's not quite clear if it's taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software's hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won't hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya's son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn't reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn't reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it's the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now's a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game's story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late '90s. However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if "DK Mode" will be renamed to something more generic like "Big Head Mode" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.]]></summary>

The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts.

Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.]]></summary>

On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor's Tome Trackers.

        <updated>2022-09-13T14:31:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't believe I'm writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it's out next year. 
Let's get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here's what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today's reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch."

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and "very close to completion." Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that "it is progressing," seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts' It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards' 2021's Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend's pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said "It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled."
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles," Nowakowski said during the call. "Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future." 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion.

More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game's service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn't really outline the reason but it's likely due to the game's poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game's issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has "no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon's Fall."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is finally releasing across Asia this month, and ahead of its appearance at the Tokyo Game Show (complete with unnervingly large replica of the handheld), Valve held their own launch event with a display of several prototype designs. Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I'm more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger's mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn't care for metal music.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/12/ubisofts-big-triple-a-games-will-be-70-according-to-ceo-yves-guillemot"/>
        <updated>2022-09-12T21:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that "Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70." 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn't, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, "In terms of pricing, we've been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet." Today's Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It's worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.
You can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft's troubled workplace culture, the company's current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint's integration of them, and plenty more here.]]></summary>

Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn't know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won't pay the bills, but he didn't let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children's book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.

And I wasn't being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game's mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it's going to be a real hit when it lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. "Let me in!!" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. "I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!"
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Oh, come on!" is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It's often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, "You havin' a laugh, mate?" and "Facking hell!" - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik' tha', innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she's often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. 
It's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something.

Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

Hey, I’m not knocking it, and I’ll even put together this guide that early Black Friday birds might find useful. I just don’t even think of what I want for dinner later.

Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys's plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To divert people away from piracy, legal streaming services warn of the unreliability of illegal streaming sites. But for the third time in a matter of weeks, football fans have been unable to watch key matches due to legal platforms falling over. As one fan wrote on Twitter: if I pay for a legal service that doesn't work and can find a pirate stream in less than a minute, why am I paying?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin's Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin's Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin's Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure's 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny "it's the Daddy" Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin's Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it's set in feudal Japan.

The suggestion that Assassin's Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is "going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise in the future".

Like everything, it's also a roguelike, but it's transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I've found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It's a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that's half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you're looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022's gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what's worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken "control" of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

Because that's how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There's a lot to like about its final form. There's also a lot to... I don't quite want to say hate, but I'm also not quite sure why. It's one of the most evenly mixed bags I've ever rummaged around in.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we're talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley's Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to "the fat chapter", and the others all went "Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!". Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.

It borrows so much from Nintendo's behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
