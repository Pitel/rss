        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first batch of Steam Decks will be released tomorrow and if you’re one of the lucky people who were able to secure one of the first preorders for this new device, you might be looking to see which games you can play on it. 
Fortunately, thanks to a new Steam page, you can sign in to your account and quickly see what’s verified for Steam Deck, what’s playable, and what won’t work on it. It takes less than a minute and you’ll see four different categories for your Steam Library games: Deck Verified Games From Your Library, Deck Playable Games From Your Library, Unsupported Deck Games From Your Library, and Untested Deck Games From Your Library. 
Here’s what each means, according to Valve: 
Deck Verified: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are fully functional on Steam Deck, and work great with built-in controls and display.
Deck Playable: Valve’s testing indicates these titles from your Steam Library are functional on Steam Deck, but might require extra effort to interact with or configure. 
Unsupported: Valve’s testing indicates these games in your Steam Library currently don’t function on Steam Deck. Valve is continuing to add support for more games over time. 
Untested: Valve’s testing team hasn’t yet gotten to the remaining games in your Steam library, but we’re testing new games every day. Come back often to see more of your library get Verified. 
You can sign in to your Steam account here to see which of your Steam Library games are Steam Deck verified and ready to play. After that, check out these images comparing the Steam Deck's size to the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Switch.

A shop owner who runs a retro game store in Japan's Mie Prefecture was arrested by Japanese law enforcement following the sale of a forged Pokémon card in December 2021, according to a report from CBC TV.
Yukinori Harada, the 48-year-old owner of Alive Yokkaichi Tokiwa, allegedly sold the fake for 2,200 Yen (about $20) to a customer, but his arrest wasn't just for the card — he also allegedly had a fake copy of "Rockman" displayed in store, which is the Japanese name for Mega Man. Harada admitted to the police investigators that he thought it might have been a fake when he sold it.

Today's new episode of The Game Informer Show is bursting with everything you need to know about Elden Ring as we discuss why we think developer FromSoftware's latest adventure lives up to the hype. That's not all though, as we're also wishing longtime GI vet Ben Reeves a fond farewell as he sails off to great things at his new position, along with another great round of Listener Questions.
Production Note: Our recording software cut out during the episode, so we apologize for any audio hitches you may encounter. We'll have everything taken care of next week. We appreciate your understanding.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is rightly considered one of the best games in the history of the art form, but many edgy hipsters think that its sort-of sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is in fact a preferable experience if you can blinking believe it. We can because the three of us involved in the video above are just original enough to have this mad kind of opinion, and yes our Myspace profiles were mostly black and red now that you mention it.
As we explain in the video above it's hard to argue that Majora's Mask is an inherently better game than Ocarina of Time. Ocarina had all the classic fantasy narrative, the original character designs, the bizarre obsession with entering the bodies of large, semi-legendary creatures, it's all a superb rollercoaster of thrills and excitement with a well-rounded conclusion. Majora's Mask is more like an avant-garde Hungarian short film about the illegal taxidermy trade in comparison, but damn it if we don't we want to learn more about this dark and grizzled underground commerce.

Cult of the Lamb is a delightfully demented-looking title by Massive Monster and Devolver Digital that became one of our most anticipated indie titles when it was first unveiled last August. The game lets you control a cute lamb and form a demonic cult. Fun! PC had been the only confirmed platform, but a new update has announced that Cult of the Lamb will spread its influence to consoles.
That would be PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, to be specific. Unfortunately, a release date remains elusive, but Cult of the Lamb is still targeting 2022.

In Cult of the Lamb, you play as a possessed lamb who must repay a debt to a mysterious stranger who saved their life. That repayment comes in the form of forming a cult dedicated to this stranger’s name. You’ll travel across the procedurally generated land spreading the good (?) word to seduce followers by preaching sermons, holding dark rituals, and gathering resources to construct idols and other structures of worship. Combat is of the hack ‘n slash variety as you cut down rival cult leaders, non-believers, and monsters. The game looks wild, and we hope it lives up to its potential when it arrives later this year.]]></summary>

Yes, they apparently exist!
Kit and Krysta's new podcast — appropriately titled The Kit & Krysta Podcast — is already live, with episode one available and episode two arriving imminently at the time of writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Elden Ring launching tonight (or already out in some places), Bandai Namco have released notes for the day-one patch. While this is probably more notable to console players buying the game on a 'disc' (some sort of tangible version of Spotify, I think?), perhaps you might be interested to see what's changed since the version of the game reviewers reviewed? You know, all those glowing, effusive reviews, who evidently weren't super-bothered by these issues. But it's good to know.

But before it was on the front page of Steam and selling like hotcakes, it was a Half Life 2 mod cooked up by designer and writer Dan Pinchbeck and a group of friends. “I was doing a PhD, weirdly, on first person shooters,” Pinchbeck says. As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”

Kirby and the Forgotten Land, also known as "Breath of the Kirby" and "Nier: Kirbtomata" amongst fans that see a resemblance between the pink puff's latest outing and other recent open-world games, is due to come out on March 25th, 2022 — just one month from today. That means pre-order bonuses are still available, and although the Western options are a bit boring (notebooks? Stickers? Bah) it turns out that other countries are getting really good ones.
In Hong Kong, pre-ordering Kirby and the Forgotten Land will get you this extremely cute "Mouthful Mode" backpack cover, modelled after Kirby's new car-devouring power.

        <updated>2022-02-24T16:22:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has asked a court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against it first filed in November of last year that alleges gender discrimination within the company. 
Former Sony IT security analyst, Emma Majo, sought court approval to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit last year on behalf of other women who worked for the company in the past. She alleged that “Sony discriminates against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men,” as reported by Axios last year. 
Now, Sony is asking a court to dismiss Majo’s class-action case against it, citing a lack of facts to support the claims presented in the lawsuit, Axios reports. 
“Despite the sweeping breadth of her lawsuit, the allegations in which [Sony Interactive Entertainment] categorically denies, she fails to plead facts to support either her individual claims or the claims of the broad-based classes of women she seeks to represent,” Sony’s lawyer wrote, according to court documents. 
Furthermore, Sony writes in documents that Majo failed to “identify a single policy, practice, or procedure at SIE that allegedly formed the basis of any widespread intentional discrimination or had a discriminatory impact on women,” and that Majo’s “widespread claims of harassment are based solely on unactionable allegations of run-of-the-mill personnel activity.” 
Sony also asks the court to recognize what it calls a conflict of interest, too. Majo’s lawsuit includes an attempt to include all women who worked for SIE. Sony says this would include all of Majo’s managers since 2017, which were all women. Sony’s lawyer says that if those managers are included in the suit against Sony, “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” rise. 
Only time will tell if the court approves Sony’s request to dismiss the case.

Contrary to what I say on the recording, this is in fact episode 175 of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. I probably got it wrong because I'd been up all night at the discotheque. Yes, this week we're taking a suggestion from the listeners and talking about our favourite nightclubs in games. And three more qualified people to talk about clubbing you would not meet.
But first this week there's some big Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill news to get out of the way, plus we discuss drinking animal blood in VIP sections (which is what rich people do), and at what point it stops being cool to go to a nightclub. For me? Almost immediately. And me and Matthew have actually been playing a game, but it's a PlayStation game so please don't listen to us talk about it. But you should definitely listen to Matthew's Hitman-themed Cavern Of Lies.

Elden Ring finally hits consoles and PC tomorrow, and today, one day before its release, Bandai Namco and From Software have released the patch notes for Patch 1.02, which is essentially the game’s day-one patch. 
In it, you’ll find numerous fixes, bug squashes, and more. If this day-one patch is like previous ones, it’s likely you won’t even be playing the game until after this update has been installed. If you’re buying the game physically or already have it pre-loaded with a digital purchase, this update will likely be pushed before you begin the game.

Addition and adjustments of background music
Text adjustments
Balance adjustments
NPC event fixes and adjustments
Fixed frame rate drops under certain conditions
Fixed text bug in some languages
Fixed a bug that prevented the Xbox wireless headset from working properly 
These patch notes also include a quick note about the game’s forthcoming implementation of ray-tracing, citing this support is planned for after the game’s launch tomorrow and that more details about it will be revealed in “future announcements.” 
While waiting for this patch to download and install, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to determine why we gave it a 10 out of 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the game where you peel a dead woman’s face off. You do it slowly, with a blunt dog tag, making several raggedy incisions before tearing off the face proper. After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. 


Apart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead. They suck. Horror games are allowed to be horrific, but the way to cultivate real fear is through restraint rather than desensitising bombardment. For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer:
      Nintendo
      
Nintendo has announced that it is acquiring SRD Co. LTD., a long-time development partner that has worked on titles within franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.
If you’ve been paying attention to the video game industry as of late, you likely already know that 2022 has so far been defined by one word: acquisitions. 
It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion, and then two weeks later, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie, the developer behind Destiny 2, for $3.6 billion.
Nintendo revealed earlier this month that despite acquisitions happening throughout the industry, it wasn’t going to change its investment plans. It also revealed that it’s not against acquisitions they deem necessary and it seems acquiring SRD was the next necessary move for the Kyoto-based company. 
SRD was founded in 1979 and has worked closely with Nintendo for decades, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Not only has it worked with Nintendo on Mario and Zelda games, but the studio has helped develop Animal Crossing entries, Game Builder Garage, 1-2 Switch, and Ring Fit Adventure. This acquisition transaction is expected to be complete by April 1, 2022, and at the time of this writing, a price has not been named. 
Nintendo said in a statement that acquiring SRD will “serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo,” according to Video Games Chronicle. 
Today’s news about this acquisition is the first following Nintendo’s purchase of Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer, Next Level Games, back in January of last year.

Much has been written about how the N64, for all of its amazing games and technological advancements, was something of a misstep for Nintendo – especially after a decade of amazing success with the NES, Game Boy and SNES.
Nintendo famously decided to go with expensive cartridges rather than adopt cheaper (but easily-to-pirate) CDs, a choice which cost it the support of more than one third-party publisher, with former staunch ally Square being perhaps the most notable example. Shiny's Dave Perry was vocal about the fact that he wouldn't support the system at the time, but the loss of Square's support hurt Nintendo more keenly. The company's Final Fantasy RPGs had been million-sellers on the Famicom and Super Famicom, but the relationship between the two companies broke down in spectacular fashion in the mid-'90s, with Square linking up with Sony for the seminal Final Fantasy VII, a title that was originally intended for Nintendo hardware.

Are you part of the 'Nintendo Generation'? To most video game fans — even Nintendo fanatics — that term tends to apply to people who first became obsessed with the company's 8- and 16-bit output in the late '80s to mid '90s. The 'Nintendo Generation', then, are fast approaching their 40s if they haven't hit that milestone already (making them 'Millennials' in generational parlance). However, for US Army Major Jon-Marc Thibodeau, the term apparently applies to today's 18-25-year-olds.
That's according to a bit of US Army PR put out recently (thanks, Vice) where, in a matter of words, the Major — "a clinical coordinator and chief of the medical readiness service line" — described Gen Z recruits as soft, tender morsels with mushy skeletal structures unprepared for rigours of army life thanks to an upbringing involving too many video games and too few outdoor activities:

The season of acquisitions rolls on, although the latest video-game-company-buys-other-video-game-company news isn't quite a bombshell of the likes we've seen from Microsoft and co. recently. In fact, it's more a solidification and strengthening of long-term relationship which dates back to the early NES days. Aww.
As spotted by Games Industry Biz, Nintendo has acquired long-term development partner SRD Co., the Tokyo-based studio run by director and president Toshihiko Nakago that's partnered with Nintendo on projects dating back nearly four decades, with the latest collaboration being last year's Game Builder Garage. The deal is expected to close on 1st April this year, according to the official press release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer:
      Sony Interactive Entertainment
      
Since the previous PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles, game captures such as screenshots and videos have become more and more popular. With the start of this current generation back in 2020, it was clear that PlayStation and Xbox were going to encourage us even more to share our best captures. 
Doing so on Xbox Series X/S, and even Xbox One, has been relatively easy when it comes to getting images and videos off of the hard drive and onto your phone, for example. You simply capture what you want and in a few minutes, it’ll be automatically uploaded to the official Xbox app. From there, you can save and download the image to your phone, which makes sharing it on social media a breeze. However, that wasn’t possible on PlayStation, despite how much players wanted this feature…until now.

As you can see in the video above, PlayStation has rolled this feature out for PS5 players. You’ll need to enable it in your console’s settings and the PlayStation App first, of course, but after that, screenshots and videos under three minutes long will be automatically uploaded to the PlayStation App. They’ll remain there for 14 days and during that time you can save and download any images or videos you want to your mobile device. And, much like with Xbox game captures, this makes it much easier to share your captures with friends and others on social media. 
For more about the PS5, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 PlayStation 5 games and then check out these details about the latest PS5 beta, which adds extra party chat options, game base enhancements, UI changes, and more to the console. Read about the PS5 covers and new DualSense colors after that.

The 2D beat 'em up by 13AM Games and Wayforward lets up to two players assume the gargantuan roles of monsters and mechs to lay the smackdown on equally titanic adversaries. You're more than just a lumbering brute, as you can outfit these beasts with various mods and abilities to broaden your offensive arsenal. The result is a chaotic monster mash that also boasts a sharp look thanks to its comic book-inspired aesthetic.

Rapper Machine Gun Kelly has hopped aboard the hype train for WWE 2K22, severing as an official partner by providing his music and shaping the game's soundtrack. He’s also set to become a playable superstar himself. 
2K has announced that MGK will arrive as part of a post-launch content pack (which has no release date), so don’t expect to do this to him on release day:

Kelly serves as executive producers on 2K22's soundtrack, helping curate its tunes which include the following:
Machine Gun Kelly - "Concert for Aliens"
Machine Gun Kelly ft. Yungblud & Bert McCracken - "Body Bag"
Wu-Tang Clan - "Protect Ya Neck"
Motorhead - "Iron Fist"
Poppy - "Say Cheese" (Live NXT version)
Royal Blood - "Typhoons"
Bring Me The Horizon - "Happy Song"
The Weeknd - "Heartless"
Turnstile - "I Don't Wanna Be Blind"
Asking Alexandria - "The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)”
KennyHoopla - "Hollywood Sucks."
I know it seems weird, but Kelly is a known wrestling fan and has made several appearances on WWE programming over the years so the partnership makes sense and must be pretty cool for him. I just want to know what his rating and moveset would be. Also, does this open the door for Bad Bunny to join the roster? Because I would unironically be down for that.
WWE 2K22 arrives March 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can view the full list of the confirmed superstars here.]]></summary>

They did it. They did the thing. And it’s awesome. 
If you’ve seen Spider-Man: No Way Home, then you know of its biggest secrets (which is one of the movie industry’s worst-kept secrets): there are three Spider-Mans, err, Spider-Men, in it and accompanying Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire’s own iteration of the character. In the movie, they kind of allude to the most infamous Spider-Man meme out there – the three Spider-Man pointing at each other, surprised to see other iterations of themselves – but now, Marvel has released a better, official version of it. 
As you can see in the image above, Holland, Maguire, and Garfield perfectly replicated the meme in their own suits and it’s everything we imagined it would be. Plus, it comes alongside news that Spider-Man: No Way Home can be streamed digitally on March 22 before it hits 4K and Blu-ray on April 12. 
After you calm down from the glory that is that image, read about this announcement for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, and then check out this trailer for Insomniac’s Wolverine game now in development. Read why one Game Informer editor believes this Wolverine needs to occupy the same world as Insomniac’s Spider-Man after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This interview was conducted by Andrew Reiner and Suriel Vazquez, and transcribed by Michael Leri. It was originally published on December 1, 2016.
Ed Boon has likely been making video games longer than you’ve been alive. Years before he became the steward of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Boon was programming pinball and arcade games for companies that no longer exist. But despite his over 30-year history in the industry, he’s only ever really had one job.
To get a full view of what such a storied career looks like, we talked with Boon about his early days at Williams Electronics, some of the names Mortal Kombat could have had, and what it’s like working on the same series for over two decades.

A Plague Tale: Requiem doesn’t have a release date yet, but that hasn’t stopped publisher Focus Entertainment from unveiling a rather cool Collector’s Edition.
The centerpiece of this bundle, pictured above, is a resin statue of protagonists Amicia and Hugo. Standing 8.3 inches tall, Amicia takes aim with her new crossbow. 
The bundle also includes the following items (none of which are supernatural rats, thankfully):
A Plague Tale: Requiem game with store-exclusive cover art
Collector’s box
45 RPM vinyl (2 tracks)
Hugo’s metal feather brooch (2.4") 
3 A4 lithographs
Additionally, buying the Collector’s Edition gets you the Protector Pack which includes these in-game items:
Red Damsel crossbow skin
Bonus crafting material
13 exclusive cosmetic items for Amicia
The entire package will set you back $189.99 and it’s only available at the Focus Entertainment Store. 
A Plague Tale: Requiem is the sequel to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence. Amicia and Hugo find themselves on another rat-infested journey in search of an island believed to contain a secret for curing Hugo’s curse. The game launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch (cloud version), and PC. You can watch its most recent gameplay trailer from The Game Awards 2021 here and view its latest screenshots here.]]></summary>

Last month, Bioware shared a blog post updating fans on the status of the studio while promising a future update on the next Dragon Age title. Today, a new post makes good on that promise by giving fans a better idea of where it is on the development pipeline and the designers leading the project.
According to Bioware GM Gary McKay, the unofficially titled Dragon Age 4 is currently in the middle of full production, writing “Our blueprint was completed last year, so we’re now focused on building out our vision: creating amazing environments, deep characters, strong gameplay, impactful writing, emotional cinematics – and much more. The blueprint for the game is well understood and the team is focused.”

Horizon Forbidden West was released this past Friday and after a weekend where likely millions of players began Aloy’s latest journey, Guerrilla Games has released Patch 1.05, the game’s first. 
This patch takes aim at several issues in the game, such as an oversharpening of the screen image when HDR is on, and it fixes dozens of them while also listing out known issues the team is working on.

If the minimum recommended graphics card is a GTX 1060, how hard will it be to travel the Lands Between on the highest quality settings? Or at 4K? Would this game kill PCs like it kills player characters?


Nope. As it turns out, Elden Ring will perfectly manageable on a range of hardware, and even if you do want to up the frame rate, there are over a dozen custom graphics options to help you get there. Below, you’ll find guide to Elden Ring’s best settings, based on my performance testing so far. But be warned: Just because it can run decently on PC, doesn’t mean that this is a particularly good PC port.

Platinum Games’ Nier: Automata is getting an anime. 
This was revealed by publisher Square Enix during the game’s fifth anniversary livestream today by way of a new teaser trailer that you can watch below. The teaser, which is quite brief clocking in at just 31 seconds, doesn’t reveal too much at all. It showcases what could perhaps be the anime’s animation style, although it could just be concept art of 2B and her Pod companion bot.

As you can see in the trailer above, there’s not too much to glean from it. However, Square Enix released some additional information about it after the fact, revealing that in this anime, humans have left Earth to go to the moon as a result of an overwhelming amount of seemingly dangerous machines on their home planet. 2B, who is playable in Nier: Automata, is sent back down to Earth to help reclaim the planet and if you’re at all familiar with the game, you can probably see where this anime might be heading.
Aniplex, the studio behind anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, is working on this Nier: Automata anime. 
While waiting for this anime to drop, read Game Informer’s Nier: Automata review and then check out this story about the upgrade patch Nier: Automata finally received on Steam after fans have been asking for it for four years. Read Game Informer’s Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a moment, pretend you're an examiner marking FromSoftware games. Get that red biro ready. "Tried jumping, didn't work", you might pop by Dark Souls. "Nothing but grief here", you mark by Bloodborne. "Time for crab", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.
But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. "Visions of joy" sums it up nicely.

Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio’s last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the …]]></summary>

Yesterday they laid out their plans for improving performance, stability, and a few other issues, expecting to launch the first 'hotfix' patch this week. But some issues have many causes, so they warn it'll take time and multiple patches to really fix the game.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture.

All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.
So I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2012, the late great Antony Bourdain tweeted an impassioned defence of a fellow food writer, then 85 year old Marilyn Hagerty, whose recent positive review of her local Olive Garden had become the subject of widespread memery. I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence.

He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews.

Bungie’s latest expansion for Destiny 2, The Witch Queen, is now live and so is the accompanying Season of the Risen that will run until May 24. 
To help celebrate the launch of this new expansion and subsequent season, the studio, which is being acquired by Sony, released a Season of the Risen overview trailer that highlights what Guardians should expect. As expected, it’s all centered around Savathûn and the Hive, which is now in possession of the Light. You can watch the trailer below:

As you can see, this season will be all about kiling Light-wielding Hive (and just good ole regular Hive, too). It seems a Cabal friend will be joining the fight to make it a little easier well. And of course, who could forget about the overarching villain, Savathûn the Witch Queen, who is sure to make virtually everything this season more challenging. 
Destiny 2’s Witch Queen expansion and Season of the Risen is now live. When you need a break from Savathûn, read this opinion piece about why Destiny 2’s recent season conclusion shows the good and bad of living game content and then watch this Destiny 2: The Witch Queen launch trailer. Check out this amazing Destiny 2 Savathûn statue after that.

Square Enix has released some new financial results for its first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2022-23, something companies like EA and Activision Blizzard did earlier this month, and in it, the company reveals that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy did not meet sales expectations. 
This news comes alongside Square Enix revealing in its quarterly results that its net sales were lower this year than the same period in the previous fiscal year, which saw the release of titles like Final Fantasy VII Remake and Marvel’s Avengers on new-gen consoles. Speaking specifically to the release of Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Square Enix acknowledges that it reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it a 8.5 out of 10. However, it underperformed financially.

“The HD Games sub-segment launched ‘Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy’ in Q3,” the results read. “Despite strong reviews, the game’s sales on launch undershot our initial expectations.”
Square Enix says that it has been using sales initiatives that it kicked off in November of 2021 to increase sales and the company intends to “work to continue to expand sales to make up for the title’s slow start.”
Hopefully, those sales can get Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy up to expectations, and even past it, because it certainly warrants a sequel that we’d like to see. For now, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy review and then check out these Adidas sneakers inspired by the game. Read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that.

Eyes up, Guardians! Savathûn, the Hive god and Witch Queen has harnessed the Light to do her bidding. With it, she has molded part of her throne world into an opulent white cathedral and has gifted her Lucent Brood with powers, not unlike those the Guardians wield. Survival for Earth's champions is a must, and doing so means taking the fight to Savathûn's home turf and facing her terrifying Light-wielding forces head-on.

Bandai Namco released a new launch trailer for Elden Ring, which hits consoles and PC this Friday, and it promises a celebration of war for champions of the Lands Between. 
As you might expect with an Elden Ring trailer, or really any From Software game trailer, it’s not easy to parse together exactly what’s happening. A narrator talks about a celebration of war, possibly in a tournament-like setting, while another talks about heroes becoming forsaken and more. It’s a lot to wrap one’s head around but even if you aren’t determined to piece together the new lore presented in the trailer, there’s plenty to see.

There are some new looks at bosses and enemies as well as new settings and locales, too. We even get a look at a boss that looks very celestial and Bloodborne-like – could there be a Bloodborne connection in Elden Ring? Who knows? For now, only time will tell and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because Elden Ring hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Friday, on February 25. 
If you’re curious as to when exactly you can head into the Lands Between, check out the Elden Ring global launch times. Read Game Informer’s Elden Ring cover story after that for tons of details about what to expect and then check out this exclusive Elden Ring gameplay featuring Castle Mourne.

It’s time for the payoff. For years, Bungie has teased the potential of Destiny’s most devious villain. In recent months, that tease has escalated. The Hive queen named Savathûn has infiltrated all the major storylines, insinuating herself into the events shaping the story. Now, at long last, the Witch Queen’s trap is sprung, as she co-opts humanity’s most precious resource – the Light that gives power to its Guardians – and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her own.

Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions’ latest movie, Uncharted, which is a prequel of sorts to the game series of the same name, have a hit on their hands. 
Fans of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series were…apprehensive, to say the least, when it was first revealed that Tom Holland (Spider-Man: No Way Home) would be playing Nathan Drake alongside a Victor “Sully” Sullivan portrayed by Mark Wahlberg. That apprehension remained with each trailer revealed for the movie and while that feeling might still be felt, now that the mo…]]></summary>

After announcing over the weekend that most ongoing Pokémon games like Pokémon Masters EX, Unite, and Sword And Shield will be receiving an update leading up to this year’s Pokémon Day on February 27, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have received a new update. 
Titled Ver 1.2.0, this update is now live in the latest Pokémon remakes and it brings with it new Union Room and Colosseum features, some fixes to improve gameplay, and a stop to the use of “illicit” Pokémon. Here’s a full breakdown of what update Ver 1.2.0 entai…]]></summary>

Finally, I could live out my dream of sliding down tree branches like Disney's Tarzan, all while playing another gorgeous adventure from the makers of Old Man's Journey and Secrets Of Raetikon. Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw it was going to be part of this week's Steam Next Fest. The developers have said upfront that the game is only around an hour long, and with this week's demo stretching to a generous 20 minutes, part of me's now quite sad that I've already seen a third of it in action.

Destiny 2’s upcoming expansion, The Witch Queen, doesn’t launch until tomorrow but you can have the titular villain orchestrate intricate schemes your own home with this grotesque statue of Savathûn.
Manufactured by Numskull Designs, who has previously crafted Destiny statues of Eris Morn, Cayde-6, and others, this collectible version of the Sister of Shapes stands 11.5 inches tall and sports an equally imposing wingspan of 26 inches. The intricately detailed and hand-painted Savathûn sits atop a base (complete with acolyte soldier) with plastic wing supports.

If you’re intrigued, you can pre-order the statue right now on Numskull's store page for $200.00. It's expected to ship sometime during Q3 2022 (between July and September). 
Destiny 2: The Witch Queen arrives February 22. You can read our extended preview of the expansion here.]]></summary>

I'll be honest; I came up with this headline before I thought about what this article would really be about. Because, realistically, what can I say here? "Remember that blockbuster gaming franchise that everyone loves and has just gotten a film adaptation? They should make more of those." It's kind of a "no duh" situation. I'm not the first person to say they liked *good thing* and want another *good thing*. I should probably say something a little more sensational. Okay, fine: Uncharted is an incredibly unique, industry-s…]]></summary>

But which pairings work the best?
We don’t need to keep explaining how this works; you’re probably sick of seeing “Which president approximately equals which Chrono Cross character” lists all over the internet by now, but we’ll try to throw in some nontraditional picks to surprise you.

Street Fighter 6 was announced late last night, and I can’t stop watching the short trailer that debuted the title. Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. 
Here is the confirmed roster so far with the most recent additions in bold. 
AJ Styles
Akira Tozawa
Angel Garza
Bret Hart
Candice LaRae
Cedric Alexander
Dakota Kai
Faarooq
Fabian Aichner
Jerry Lawler
Jim Neidhart
Jordan Devlin
Kane
Liv Morgan
Mace
Marcel Barthel
Maryse
Natalya
Otis
Papa Shango
R-Truth
Raul Mendoza
Sami Zayn
Santos Escobar
Sonya Deville
Stephanie McMahon
T-Bar
Ted Dibiase
Trent Seven
Trish Stratus
Vince McMahon
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.

IGN’s Ryan McCaffery interviewed Halo’s cast and creators and when he popped the million-dollar question, the show's executive producer and 343 Industries Head of Transmedia Kiki Wolfkill confirmed Chief's face will be shown. She explains it as a storytelling necessity by saying, “We set out to tell a character story and a personal story, and once we really got into what that story was, it became clear that you really needed to see the person in the armor and under the helmet. So you will.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime’s Fallout TV series has found one of its lead stars. Walton Goggins has been confirmed to star in the show, according to a new report by Deadline on Friday. 
Goggins’ most notable TV roles include portraying Boyd Crowder on the Western crime drama Justified, voicing Cecil Stedmen in Amazon’s hit series Invincible, and Baby Billy Freeman in The Righteous Gemstones. Goggins film credits include The Hateful Eight, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the most recent Tomb Raider film. His role in Fallout series is unknown, but Deadline reports that he’s rumored to portray a Ghoul, a human mutated by radiation in the Fallout universe. 
The Fallout show, which still has no official title, was first announced in 2020. Besides sharing the same general premise as the games, plot details are practically non-existent but the series is helmed by Amazon Studios and Kilter Films, with Bethesda involved as well. Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) will direct the premiere episode and serves as executive producer. Nolan’s Westworld partner Lisa Joy is also involved along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) serving as showrunners. The show is currently in pre-production and has no premiere date. 
If you're looking for more video game series to look forward to, here's a list of upcoming animated adaptations. On the live-action end of things, Paramount+ is getting a spin-off show based on the Sonic the Hedgehog films, and HBO's The Last of Us apparently won't be premiering until next year. There's also a little-known series called Halo debuting next month.

Since then, the MMO has exploded in popularity thanks to several well-received expansions, including its latest, Endwalker.

During its recent Letter from the Producer Live presentation, the publisher discussed its plans to support the game for the next decade.

There’s a reason why titles like Titan Souls exist, boss rush games that distil the experience into a pure form, rejecting all the faffing about in between. Your carefully honed skills are put to the test against imaginative and outrageous beasties in spectacular arenas. What could be better than that?
Literally every other part of the game.

Developer:
      Capcom
      
If you were busy doing important things such as sleeping, Capcom announced Street Fighter 6 during the wee hours of the morning following the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. A brief cinematic teaser trailer of Ryu and Street Fighter V upstart Luke is all we have to go on for now in terms of details, but that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate on what we want/expect from the title. So World Warriors, what do you want from Street Fighter 6?
As a Street Fighter fan who grew up loving SF II, was less hot on III, got back on the wagon with IV, and completely skipped V, I’m a bit out of the loop, so I'm not entirely sure myself. I'm confident the gameplay itself will be fine, but the reason I never got around to playing the fifth game was due to its infamously botched launch. SFV released missing desired features (like an arcade/story mode) for so long that I stopped caring and had occupied myself with other fighting games by the time they arrived. So I suppose my number one request for Street Fighter 6 is not to do that again. 
I’d also like to see a completely new art direction. Although I loved SF IV’s aesthetic, which was carried over to a lesser extent in V, I believe it's run its course. A new look would really freshen things up and make it feel like a true sequel. The reveal trailer looked mostly unlike the past two entries, though that could just be for the cinematic. We’ll have to wait for gameplay footage/screenshots to see how Street Fighter 6 truly appears. Oh, and make the game multiplatform this time around with cross-play and all that good stuff. 
Now that my boring requests are out of the way, it’s your turn: what do you want to see in Street Fighter 6?]]></summary>

Far: lone Sails was first released in 2018 and it gained quite a fan base – Game Informer gave it an 8.25 in our review – thanks to its unique premise, meditative gameplay, and interesting world design. Developer Okomotive is back with a sequel to it with this year's Far: Changing Tides and it promises to bring all of the environmental puzzles with it. 
This time around, your goal is to move a ship...somewhere. In order to do that, though, you'll need to find new ways to keep the ship powered, discover how to break through an obstacle, and more. In this new installment of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Ben Reeves, talk about the game's opening 15 minutes and some of the first puzzles in it. 
How does it feel compared to Lone Sails? What's the narrative like thus far? Does Changing Tides bring all of the Limbo and Inside-esque worldbuilding with it that Lone Sails did back in 2018? Wesley and Ben talk through these questions and more in today's New Gameplay Today. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming puzzle game from Okomotive, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on March 1.]]></summary>

Capcom’s weeklong countdown clock has expired and on the other side is the announcement of Street Fighter 6.
The reveal fittingly came at the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. The cinematic teaser showed a face-off between Ryu and Luke, the final DLC fighter to join Street Fighter V who Capcom previously said would play an important role in the franchise's future. The art style resembles a more traditional 3D look compared to the ink brush style that defined Street Fighters 4 and 5, though this could only be for the trailer and not indicative of the in-game graphics. Unfortunately, nothing else was revealed other than the promise of more information coming this summer.

Shortly after the reveal, Yusuke Hashimoto, the director of Bayonetta 2 who has also worked on the Resident Evil series and God Hand, announced on Twitter that he's among the game's designers. 
Street Fighter 6, the newest entry in the Street Fighter series, has finally been revealed!

When that stalled, Watch Tower filed a copyright lawsuit. Citing fair use, a judge has now ruled that the subpoena will not be granted. Surprisingly, Watch Tower is pressing ahead with its copyright lawsuit regardless.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Last week, we kicked things off with Drake's Fortune, and now we move on to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the superb sequel that catapulted the franchise into the stratosphere.  
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves launched October 13, 2009, just shy of two years after Drake's Fortune. Now that it had a solid foundation to work with, Naughty Dog set out to create the video game equivalent of a summer blockbuster film. That included eschewing cutscene setpieces in favor of technically impressive gameplay moments that still offered control over the action, such as the game's famous train sequence. The writing and characters shone even brighter, from Nate himself to newcomer Chloe Frazer to everyone's favorite girl next door, Elena Fischer. Uncharted 2 also introduced a surprisingly solid multiplayer mode, rounding out a stellar package that went on to win numerous Game of the Year awards (ours included). 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and IGN Senior Editor Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) as we unpack the development history and impact of Nathan Drake's magnum opus. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

Well, Ubisoft have made their stupid-ass stance on NFTs quite clear, so let's move on to question two. In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much to my great shame, I never got round to playing Deathloop at the end of last year. Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios are considering making Prime shows and films based on video games, signing a first-look deal with the production company currently planning adaptations of games including Disco Elysium and Life Is Strange. This will give Amazon the first opportunity to snap up anything DJ2 Entertainment might be making, if they want to. This is not, however, an announcement that Amazon will make these specific shows. These shows still might never get made, by anyone. But maybe it's enough of a step forwards for you to start daydreaming about what such shows could be?

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackbird Interactive, the makers of Homeworld 3 and Hardspace: Shipbreaker, have announced plans to switch to a four-day work week for all employees. They join a small but growing number of game studios aiming to actively combat burnout by giving employees more time to themselves. Like many others who've tried a four-day week, they say that not only were people happier, productivity was not harmed. Cool. Who's next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of former CD Projekt Red folks have formed a new studio, announcing plans to make their own "AAA" "story-driven" "dark fantasy RPG". The studio are named Rebel Wolves, and they're founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who was director of The Witcher 3 and secondary game director on Cyberpunk 2077. Their RPG is largely a mystery for now, though a wee bit of artwork suggests at least one vampire is involved?

Having originally begun life on mobile devices back in 2013, this combat-free space exploration and resource management game arrived on PC two years later as part of a snazzed up Ω Edition, putting you in the shoes of a lone astronaut trying to survive on the fringes of deep space. It was also bloody difficult, with a punishing brutality lying beneath its serene and comforting surface - something that developer Mi-Clos Studio's founder and creative director Michaël Peiffert has been keen to address with its upcoming sequel, Out There: Oceans Of Time.

But Update 1.5 might be bad news for players with older PCs. CD Projekt Red have officially ended support for Nvidia GeForce 700 series graphics cards, and announced plans to end Windows 7 support later this year. This isn't immediately bad, but the game could end up breaking on affected computers in the future.

I had to buy new carpet recently, and Carpet Man told me that the only shade of carpet anyone wants nowadays is grey, resting one hand on his hip and the other on a pile of pile. He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.
Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

Then they followed it up with the Journey's Actual End update a few months after that. Then a Don't Starve crossover update last year. They're filthy rotten liars, I'm saying, and what wonderful liars. They've now announced another upcoming update, named Labor Of Love after the Steam Award they won for their ongoing support. Fair does!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

The free-to-play action-RPG hit 1.32 million peak concurrent players on Saturday, narrowly pushing it past the all-time peaks of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2. Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frankly I feel a bit odd writing a post that amounts to “14-year-old rendering tech works better than 20-year-old rendering tech”, but Lost Ark – 2022’s biggest surprise hit so far – has only recently come around to the benefits of DirectX 11. While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each new Disgaea game is a new opportunity to finally get into the strange, brash and thousand-layers deep JRPG series. I've yet to manage it, but now Disgaea 6 is making its way to PC. Called Disgaea 6 Complete, it bundles last year's Switch and PS4 game together with its character and cosmetic DLC. You can find the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wordle is a puzzle game in which your vocabulary and ability to spell allow you to drill towards the solution. It's surprising how well the same design still works when the letters are replaced by numbers, and you're instead relying on your ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

That's what you're doing in Nerdle, which is Wordle for maths fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: A tweet on the Lost Ark Twitter account says that "all deployment issues have now been resolved" and that Lost Ark will launch at 2:15pm PT / 10:15pm GMT. This tweet was sent at 2:15pm PT. Players were still experiencing issues with missing characters after downloading the new patch, however, and so servers have been taken offline "to get this resolved."
An earlier tweet from the Lost Ark account said that as compensation for the delays they "will add 3 days of Crystalline Aura to all players who log in to the game between launch and 9 AM PT [5 PM UTC] on 2/13 as a small thank you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My last Elden Ring hands-on was illuminating, to say the least. As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, "I'll come back to this later. Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

Hie thee to Steam to try a free full-game trial of XCOM 2 complete with its excellent expansion, War Of The Chosen. While the free trial only runs for a few days, if you want to keep playing, the game has some daft discounts right now—like '£6 for XCOM 2 and all the DLC and everything' daft. Ridiculous bargain.
