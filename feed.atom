For months now, World of Warcraft players have been using a popular addon to create their own Classic Hardcore experience.

The Korean company has pursued an aggressive pricing strategy for these drives, and evidence of that is this latest deal on their flagship P44 Pro 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive. 
The P44 Pro is now down to $117 at Newegg when you use code SSCT2827, a price that also includes a free mousepad - nifty. For context, the 2TB drive was selling for $150, making this a pretty tidy discount.

Remember the Nintendo Dolphin? The N64 successor that would destroy the PlayStation 2 and put Nintendo back on top? Well, Nintendo ended up naming it GameCube, and it fell a bit short of the expectations of even putting a dent in the PlayStation 2.
Still, the GameCube deserves a high place in video game history for providing a home to countless classics. As spotted by VGC, Ziff Davis Vice President and video game history preservation enthusiast Adam Doree just re-reminded us of that by uploading a remastered version of the GameCube's original unveiling featuring mostly never-before-seen footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Without hesitation"
The current future of Super Smash Bros. is unclear. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate kind of did everything it needed to do, is fully exhaustive from a content perspective, and Nintendo confirmed that the final DLC roster additions are complete. Series head honcho Masahiro Sakurai is also taking a much-needed rest. But that doesn't prevent other folks from dreaming of what might have been, or what could be! That includes Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon.
Speaking to Axios, here's what Boon had to say when asked about his ideal Mortal Kombat roster addition for Smash:
"Scorpion. Not even a hesitation. I guess if they want two, it would be Scorpion and Sub-Zero.”

Boon clarifies that they chose these two because they’re easy to see on the battlefield, and for the former, “it’s cool to see a spear pull somebody,” which current combatant Ridley would know a lot about.
I mean, it's hard to really argue with him! They have more cartoony designs than a few other "core" Mortal Kombat fighters that would mesh with the Smash aesthetic, and they constantly top "most recognizable characters" polls for the series. Of course, the entire prospect of adding Mortal Kombat characters to Smash is absurd, but then again, there is a precedent (like Metal Gear Solid's Snake, or Bayonetta's Bayonetta)!
This isn't the first time someone has weighed in on dream Super Smash Bros. roster additions
As you may recall, Blizzard employees wanted Diablo to make an appearance in the Smash series years back, and multiple creatives have been slowly providing their "dream picks" either directly or indirectly with Nintendo.
Clearly, some of that hard work paid off, as Sora was introduced through a chance meeting with a Disney representative.

Stray Fawn has announced that they’ve scooped up the publishing duties for The Wandering Band’s upcoming city-builder Airborne Empire. The current plan is to launch it into Early Access in 2024.
Airborne Empire is the sequel to 2020’s Airborne Kingdom, a game that I can’t believe I haven’t played. It’s a game about building floating cities! However, it also ties in exploration, as a flying city is the ultimate mobile home. Airborne Empire will introduce pilots into the mix, making it so you’ll have to defend your city, as well as the cities on the surface. Airborne Kingdom was pretty well-received, so I’m interested to see how the sequel gets off the ground.
https://youtu.be/l1ja7SaqFFM
Stray Fawn is the developer behind The Wandering Village, another unique take on the city builder genre. I had a chance to talk to co-founder Philomena Schwab about the whole genre, and it’s cool to see them get into the paradoxically named indie-publishing business. Getting noticed as a small or solo developer often seems like a communal effort, so I love watching them come together to form a supergroup.

SNEG, a company devoted to completing GOG’s manifesto of dredging up good old games, has dropped another three PC titles of yore. This time, it’s Take No Prisoners, Cyclones, and Necrodome. Those are some real ‘90s names!
All three games are from Raven Software, the company that brought us Hexen, Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, and are now working in Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty mines.
First up, we have Take No Prisoners. This is a 1997 top-down shooter set in the post-apocalypse. You play as Slade, a man tasked with finding some sort of crystal. It’s, oh gosh… You can just smell the 1990s on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis: Nemesis
If you remember the original Resident Evil 3, you'll recall the stress of encountering the brutish tyrant known as Nemesis. Well, the tables have turned, as a new fan-made mod for the classic game lets you play from the perspective of the rocket launcher-wielding beast.
Titled "Nemesis Scenario," curious fans may download this mod from ModDB (thanks DSO Gaming). You can also check the video below to see what it's like to fill the (heavy) boots of Nemesis and go stalking the streets of Raccoon City looking for members of S.T.A.R.S.
https://youtu.be/Jov5_ziYcOM
Flipping the script
Created by retro Resident Evil modder Komizo, "Nemesis Scenario" comes with two game modes. The first is the original, which lets you play Resident Evil 3 from the titular antagonist's point of view. The second is "Arrange Mode," in which you hunt down S.T.A.R.S. and mercenaries, but without the story from the main game.
The video demonstrating the mod certainly takes away the tension typically found in Resident Evil 3. You''ll see Nemesis easily take out regular zombies, with cut scenes from the 1999 Resident Evil entry interspersed throughout. It kind of fits canonically, showing what Nemesis was possibly up to while Jill and Carlos frantically worked on puzzles.
While both the original version and the remake of Resident Evil 4 left a big impact, many have not forgotten the classic entries in the series. Resident Evil 3 and its remake were not necessarily celebrated installments. But the 1999 release still counts itself among the first iconic Resident Evil games that established the franchise.
Speaking of remakes, Capcom recently asked which Resident Evil game fans wanted to see get remade next. Some fans may believe Resident Evil 5's turn is due, but Capcom has made no announcements at this time. For now, if you have the original Resident Evil 3 on PC, you can check out Komizo's Nemesis mod.

When Nintendo revealed that "everyone is here!" for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it wasn't lying. Well, ok, not everyone is in the game, but Sakurai and co. did a pretty good job of bringing in familiar faces from all walks of gaming life. We've even got characters from other series in the genre like Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and Tekken. However, one name is notably missing from this lineup: Mortal Kombat.
Of course, this makes a lot of sense. The blood and guts of NetherRealm Studios' take on the genre was never really going to gel with Nintendo's slightly less stabby brawl — and come on, nobody wants to see Kirby's insides — and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, Nintendo has never asked for permission to move any of the characters over (thanks, Axios).

One of the things I respect about the medium of video games is its ability to tackle difficult situations in a way that other mediums can’t. Even when it comes to non-visual mediums like, say, the written word, we’re only spectators. A video game can make things about us. Some empathy is still required, but we can be the ones trapped in an uncomfortable situation.
Sometimes this is too much. When I played He Fucked the Girl Out of Me last year, it actually dug up memories of (unrelated to the subject matter) trauma that I had repressed. It was for the best, but it was also a lot.
But it doesn’t always have to be a lot, as A Long Journey to an Uncertain End proves. You can approach difficult subjects carefully and with a light hea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it secure enough?
Last night, I clicked on a link I saw floating around social media for something called The Password Game. It seemed a little neat; make a secure password against an ever-increasing set of rules. What I thought would be a momentary distraction ended up with me, and my Discord call, furiously searching Google and calculating math to try and outsmart an expanding, seemingly malicious ruleset. Our password, ultimately, failed.
The Password Game is a new overnight web game sensation from developer Neal Agarwal. They've made a number of fun, unique games with quirky problems to solve, like Absurd Trolley Problems. With The Password Game, it starts simple: make a password.
Of course, good web games are never so simple. Gradually, Agarwal introduces rules. Rules that, as they describe it, "ensure [they] will never see the pearly gates."
https://twitter.com/nealagarwal/status/1673703594778927105
Rules, rules, rules
I don't really want to spoil any of the big rule surprises for you, as that's a big part of the fun: discovering what The Password Game will throw at you. It was actually a joy to do this in a Discord call, and I highly, highly recommend doing the same if you can. Making The Password Game a social situation is great, not just because you can all collaborate, but you can share in the confusion. (My one hint? Maybe grab a Periodic Table of Elements.)
Either way, go in sight unseen and just see how far you go. Maybe even share your first-time experiences here? I'm fascinated to see how far people get. Apparently, some folks are even beating it. I don't know if I can fully figure that out, but part of me—a deep-seated, unwell aspect of myself—does want to try. At the very least, I can end up with a very, very secure password.
Try your hand at The Password Game here.

In what we're affectionately dubbing the 'Mario Maker' of racing games, Make Way is a 'DIY racer' that lets you construct your own tracks and race against your friends in chaotic cross-platform multiplayer.
There's no release date beyond a rather vague '2023' at this point, but Make Way definitely looks like something we'll be keeping a close eye on thanks to the talent working behind the scenes: namely Tom Goodchild, a 20-year veteran who has worked on the Micro Machines franchise along with more modern racers such as GRID Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No love for Nvidia, it seems
If you were hoping to get the most out of your Nvidia RTX 4000 graphics card when Starfield launches, you might be out of luck. It turns out developer Bethesda will optimize the anticipated sci-fi RPG for AMD's hardware instead.
This comes from a recent YouTube video from AMD itself, which says that the Starfield studio has partnered with the tech giant to make the game run better on systems that use its processors and graphics chips. This is great news for those of you who have a PC containing Team Red's products. Less so if you've been putting your stock into Nvidia's offerings.
https://youtu.be/9ABnU6Zo0uA
Todd Howard himself said that the team is excited to be partnering with AMD, getting the game to run as best as it can on that particular hardware. He adds that Starfield will use FSR 2.0 (AMD's upscaling technology that offers an alternative to Team Green's DLSS). Nvidia fans may feel they're being shafted a little on this front, especially for those who were hoping to get their money's worth from a 4000 series.
However, for console users, this may be beneficial. The Xbox Series X/S runs on AMD technology, both in terms of CPU and GPU. Given that Starfield is an Xbox exclusive, many of you will likely choose this system for the game anyway. For PC users with an Nvidia card, obviously you'll still be able to run the game (depending on your spec). But it does sound like Bethesda has already sided with Lisa Su and her team.
That said, FSR 2.0 is more open-source than DLSS. This means you can still make use of the image processing algorithm even if you have an Nvidia graphics card.
Starfield will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.

Indiana Jones has returned for one final crack of the whip. We have awaited Harrison Ford's return in The Dial of Destiny by rewatching the movies and whistling that John Williams theme, and we've also been looking back at Indy's video game library. By our count, there have been a total of 15 Indiana Jones games released on Nintendo systems (well, 14 really, but we'll get to that in a moment), and we're curious to know which one is best.

Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside a few other notable indies
Apple Arcade continues to truck on, as Apple can likely prop it up through thick and thin, no matter how lean the offerings might be at any given time. The powerhouse publisher has a lot to celebrate come July though, as Apple has confirmed that Stardew Valley will be hitting the service on July 21.
It's the main event (as far as I'm concerned), and I can't stop booting it up year-after-year, whether it's for a quick solo adventure or a multiplayer family outing.
Other games coming to Apple Arcade in July 2023, including one surprise
Beyond Stardew Valley, the Apple Arcade service is getting a few more additions:
Hello Kitty Island Adventure
Slay the Spire
LEGO Duplo World
Ridiculous Fishing EX
So the last one might stick out a bit, given that Vlambeer, the studio behind the viral arcade fishing hit, closed in 2020.
Speaking to Polygon, co-founder Rami Ismail shed some light on the situation, noting:
“Vlambeer remains closed, The both of us did collaborate on this, so we decided to keep it under the brand of Vlambeer, but we don’t expect more collaborations like this. The two of us, Zach Gage, and Greg Wohlwend just couldn’t resist the opportunity of revisiting the game that catapulted our careers — and having an opportunity to approach the game anew without the catch of the clones, and with 10 years of development experience. The team immediately realized that to do a proper take on the game for the modern day, we also wanted to bring aboard the creative powerhouses at KO_OP for their signature style of playfulness, to bring the game to life.”

It's great to see that the original creators were involved in this, rather than the classic tale of a rights-holding publisher forcing the IP to rise from the dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Johnny Silverhand gives his hot take
There isn't long to wait now until Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC releases. Following on from the main story, the new content will be a moodier dive into the underbelly of Night City's already seedy vibes. That's according to Keanu Reeves, anyway.
In a recent video posted to the official Cyberpunk 2077 YouTube channel, the actor, who reprises his role as Johnny Silverhand for the upcoming expansion, has been shooting the breeze about the DLC. When asked how he would describe Phantom Liberty, Reeves said that Dogtown, where the new story takes place, goes down to a "darker place" when compared to the vanilla game.
https://youtu.be/LXXqI6eYD6w
Perhaps channeling his inner Johnny, Reeves asserts (after politely asking if he could swear during the interview) that "s**t's gone down" in this new location. He adds that, in spite of the even more dystopian atmosphere that's incoming, he hopes it'll be a fun experience for people to play as well.
The Matrix star also talks a little bit about Solomon Reed, a new character in Phantom Liberty played by Idris Elba. His presence represents that extra bit of Hollywood stardom that CDPR wants for the expansion. Reeves says that Johnny has some things in common with Solomon, such as the "sense of being used" and the idea of trying to reclaim one's own life.
https://youtu.be/yifBJOwKFw0
Cyberpunk 2077 may have been one of the most controversial launches in game history, but the studio eventually turned things around with patches a-plenty. The upcoming DLC, which drops September 26, will give more than a few fans another reason to dive into this world. It sounds like it's going to be an interesting, if gritty, experience. Keanu Reeves summarizes Phantom Liberty by saying that it's a mixture of mystery, truth, a scavenger hunt for information, and whether or not you can count on anything.

It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiescovery is recorded a week before we release it, and never has this small time delay been more apparant than in our latest episode. Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.
Oh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.

Ask any long-time grappling fan what the best wrestling video game of all time is, and they’ll give you one of two answers, both published by THQ: WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, developed by Yuke’s (which is incorrect) and WWF No Mercy, developed by AKI (correct). For decades no wrestling game has touched No Mercy when it comes to actual gameplay. Granted, more recent offerings look infinitely better and have rosters and mode lists bigger than the Great Khali, but in terms of actual feel THQ’s N64 classic is still the best in many players’ eyes.
AEW: Fight Forever – rather fittingly published by THQ Nordic – is quite clearly built with No Mercy in mind, to the extent that No Mercy director Hideyuki Iwashita was brought on as ‘gameplay advisor’ to ensure the game retained that unique feel. It doesn’t quite manage to pull this off, but it comes close enough to make it a worthwhile purchase for fans of wrestling games.

Theorycraft is a relatively new studio made up of developers who, collectively, have worked on franchises like League of Legends, Valorant, Apex Legends, Overwatch, Destiny, and Halo. While the team has publicly talked about Project Loki (not the official title), today’s new trailer marks the first time the studio has shown it in action.

Back in 2021, we were dazzled by a pair of cosplayers whose Mario Bros. costumes with sound effects had even gained the attention of Mario voice actor Charles Martinet himself. At the recent Fan Expo in Dallas, the pair returned to the cosplay scene, this time taking their Mario get-up in a whole different direction.
Yes, if the headline hadn't already given it away, the pair this time decided to ditch the dungarees and cosplay as Martinet instead. Sound effects and fancy plumbing tools were not required for this one, as it looks like the duo chose to model their looks on Martinet as seen on his Wikipedia page, keeping it simple with the Mario Bros. t-shirt and a black fedora.

The real secret is to not pick passwords, it's to let software generate passwords for you, but I think I can pick a memorable yet secure password when required to. Well, I thought that until I played The Password Game, a free game you can play in your web browser. You simply need to pick a password which meets its rules, but it keeps introducing more and more which become sillier and sillier. It's a good joke and grows into quite a tricky puzzle game too. Plus it's free!

Console manufacturers have struggled with supply shortages since the pandemic, and what made the situation even worse at the time was scalpers buying out whatever was in stock and reselling it online at much higher prices.
The Switch has also been the victim of this, and now Nintendo wants to make sure history doesn't repeat itself with its "next generation machine". In the same shareholder Q&A, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged past situations with worldwide shortages.

Nintendo has just added four more games to the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive app for the Switch Online Expansion Pack service. The latest editions include The Revenge of Shinobi, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Landstalker, and Crusader of Centy.

The Revenge of Shinobi is nothing to take lightly, especially when this ninja packs a brutal arsenal of shurikens and ninjitsu skills. A sequel to SEGA’s classic arcade game, this action side-scroller plunges you into the role of Joe Musashi as he stalks and attempts to annihilate – if you’re up to the task – the evil Neo Zeed criminal network. Have faith: The power of the ninja is strong.

As part of the Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft's aim is to bring Call of Duty to as many platforms as possible. This includes Nintendo's devices, with a 10-year legal agreement already penned.
The only thing Xbox has got to overcome first is the FTC and Sony's attempts to block the deal. The pair are still trying to argue Nintendo is not a direct competitor in the main console market and therefore would not be impacted by this acquisition in the same way as PlayStation.

Let's assume you didn't watch that, though. Let's assume that you, like me, were by that point too exhausted from 90 second trailers to tune in. Let's instead watch these videos now, since they've just been uploaded as separate videos, to learn more about Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's new district, Dogtown.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.
Releasing on modern consoles, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life initially looks like nothing more…]]></summary>

BattleBit Remastered is not something I would've normally leapt into, at first blush.

I loved old Battlefield. The World War II iterations were my first introduction, but there are few shooters I've put as much time into as my family did on Battelfield 2. It was the perfect mix of progression, variety, strategy, and shooting. I mention this to underscore the praise I'm giving BattleBit Remastered when I say it reminds me of Battlefield 2.

The original build of Power Drill Massacre was my introduction to Puppet Combo’s body of work way back in… wait, I think it was only 2021. Time really has lost all meaning.
In any case, even though Power Drill Massacre was unfinished at the time, it was a pretty good first impression. Originally released in 2015, it helped establish the lo-fi horror genre among the indie market. Maybe. I mean, it probably helped, but I think it was something that gradually emerged through the work of Puppet Combo and others.
What was I getting at? Oh, right, Power Drill Massacre has been unfinished for all these years. Soon, we’ll finally get to really bore into the delicious meats of the full version. Right now, though, we’ve just got the demo as part of Steam Next Fest. Which mea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people will be Street Fighting
The latest Street Fighter has been out for just shy of a month now, and it sure seems like it's caught on. The current number of Evo registrants seems to back up this popularity too, as the tournament organizer confirms Street Fighter 6 is breaking both franchise and all-time Evo player count records.
Shared on social media, the Evolution Championship Series says Street Fighter 6 has officially broken both a franchise and all-time Evo record for competitors.
https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1673466628636561408
Evo doesn't share how many players that is. But if we're judging by the previous record count of Street Fighter V at Evo 2016, that's over 5,000 registrants.
Sign-ups for Evo 2023 are still live for a little less than two weeks. Evo 2023 is set to run August 4 through 6 in Las Vegas, NV.
Back in the saddle again
I have to admit, it's nice to see Street Fighter thriving like this. Sure, Street Fighter V delivered some pretty great sets over the years. But it always felt like SFV couldn't get out from under its launch state.
Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 has been an absolute grand slam. As Moyse put it so well, Street Fighter 6 is "a title that radiates excellence." And the players have been showing up, too. Alongside the big Evo numbers, this last week's CEO—where MenaRD took the top spot with both Luke and Blanka—also tallied up a ton of entrants.
Safe to say that Street Fighter 6 has made its impact on the scene. I'm curious to see what these numbers look like moving forward, after the launch year luster wars off. But this year's Evo debut for SF6 promises to be a big one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game's developers will be co-producing the Among Us animated show
CBS Eye Animation Productions has partnered with Innersloth, the studio behind Among Us, to create an animated TV Series based on everyone's favorite pandemic-era pastime.
According to a report by Variety, Among Us will put Owen Dennis of Infinity Train fame in the creator's seat. He'll also serve as co-executive producer alongside Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, and Antonio Canobbio of Innersloth. The series won't stray from the game's basic premise.
“Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone," reads the show's official logline. "Root out the ‘Impostor’ or fall victim to its murderous designs.”
[caption id="attachment_347219" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Titmouse, the studio behind Big Mouth and, more appropriately, Star Trek: Lower Decks, will be in charge of animation. Ben Kalina from Titmouse will also have a role as co-executive producer.
We're yet to hear about networks or streaming platforms interested in the project, but we doubt that'll take long. This is a big property, and the show has The Animation Guild behind it, not the WGA. Its production likely won't slow down due to the WGA strike.
Anyone who wants to know more about what the Among Us show might have in store should check out Infinity Train. It's a marvelously heartwarming animated show that tells the story of a bunch of great characters until the moment they all die via the scythe of unfair cancellation. Just kidding. Though the cancellation did happen and was absolutely unfair, none of Infinity Train's stories ended on cliffhangers. You should totally check it out.
Video game adaptations have finally begun to get things right with Arcane and The Last of Us. Here's hoping CBS continues the trend with its take on Among Us.

Publisher Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have just announced another milestone for the Atelier Ryza series. Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout, Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, and Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key have surpassed a total of two million units shipped.
The last report came on March 17, announcing that the series had shipped 1.6 million units. This means that the Atelier Ryza series has moved over 400,000 more units in a period filled with massive attention-stealers such as Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter VI, and Diablo IV. Now that's quite the feat.
[caption id="attachment_365614" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via Koei Tecmo[/caption]
To celebrate the series' success, Koei Tecmo has announced that they're willing to give out some goodies to fans; too bad that only applies to fans living in Japan.
Are you just hearing about the Atelier series for the first time? Then you'll probably be surprised to learn that this series has existed since '97. (That's older than Metal Gear Solid.) Atelier is a popular RPG series that began on Sony consoles, then gradually made its way to most other platforms. The Ryza games in the series follow Reisalin "Ryza" Stout. Ryza is an adventurer who travels the world looking for recipes to further her studies in the field of alchemy.
You can play either of the three newest games in the series on PS5, Xbox X|S, Switch, and Steam. The success of Atelier Ryza will likely not slow down anytime soon either, as an anime TV adaptation will come out this summer.

Retro-Bit has announced that they’re bringing the rather obscure titles – Sol-Deace and El Viento – back to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive this year. Pre-orders are now open.
Sol-Deace was originally released exclusively in Japan in 1990 on the Sharp X68000 as Sol-Feace. It would then receive a port to the Sega CD worldwide and the Genesis in North America. I have no idea why the Sega CD version is called Sol-Feace and the Genesis version is known as Sol-Deace. To my knowledge, neither “Feace” nor “Deace” are actually words. Hold on, let me look that up.
No, the dictionary thinks I mean “feces” and “deuce,” respectively, which is actually pretty amusing but not helpful.
Anyway, Sol-Deace/Feace is a horizontal shoot-’em-up. Developed by Wolf Team, the word I’ve seen most ap…]]></summary>

One that caught my eye today is the Kingston Canvas Go! Plus, which is available in a 256GB size for just £17.85 - down from an original price of £30!
For context, that's just £1 more than Samsung's Evo Plus SD card of the same size, yet you get maximum read speeds of 170MB/s compared to 130MB/s. That's 30% more, and well worth the extra quid!

The age of reboots and remakes is par for the course nowadays. So when a trailer for a Perfect Dark reboot came out in 2020, it seemed like a good time to revisit the N64 FPS. At least, that was the plan, but the project appears to have suffered from development hell for some time. In fact, it could still be years away from completion.
A recent (and insightful) report from IGN gives the skinny on what's been happening with the reboot of Rare's legendary follow-up to GoldenEye. Beginning life in 2018, The Initiative, a studio set up internally at Microsoft, got the ball rolling on bringing Perfect Dark to the modern gaming world.
However, conflicts rose between the studio and Certain Affinity, who came onboard in 2019. This slowed development,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we go again...
About this time last year, Sega released Sonic Origins—a compilation release that aimed to collate the first four (five if we count Sonic & Knuckles as a totally separate game) Mega Drive/Genesis Sonic games in one ultimate package with a bunch of extras thrown in. Though it wasn’t without its issues, Sega more or less managed to do what it set out to do, but there was a lingering sentiment amongst fans that it could’ve done much more. Now, a year later, Sega has decided to release a ‘Plus’ update — available as a DLC expansion or in physical form — that throws in a dozen new games and some other additional features to make the collection all the sweeter. Unfortunately, Sonic Origins still feels somewhat incomplete even after this update, but this new expansion is just about worth the money.
First, a brief overview of what’s been added. The headlining new addition here is the inclusion of 12 8-bit Sonic games made for the Sega Game Gear, the colour handheld which once upon a time directly competed with Nintendo’s first Game Boy. Elsewhere, Amy has been added as a playable character in the headlining four games for this collection, and Knuckles has been added as a playable character to Sonic CD after his rather odd exclusion in last year’s release. On top of that, Plus throws in all the previously released DLC with the additional missions to tackle, and content for the museum. Check out our review of the base game if you want to hear about the base offering:

I've been playing Quantum Break since it arrived on PC Game Pass, and I'm finding their oft-forgotten time-bending shooter is yet another modern Remedy game full of boring gunfights even as it gives you supernatural powers that could replace guns. Their apparent disinterest in gunfights is especially felt in a game so into telling a story that it ends chapters with TV-length live-action episodes starring actual Lance Reddick. Looking back over their past games, agh, as much as I want spooky investigations, I can't get excited about their next, Alan Wake 2.

Thankfully, the game is in a much better state these days, but the studio's own VP of PR and Communication, Michał Platkow-Gilewski, has said that the initial launch was "way better" than the reception. That's according to a recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz.

In 2022, renowned creator and industry figure Yu Suzuki revealed that his development studio Ys Net was creating an arcade-style shooter exclusively for Apple Arcade. Now, publisher ININ Games has revealed that the very game — which is a love letter and spiritual successor to Suzuki's Space Harrier — is coming to consoles, including Switch, on 10th November. (Thanks, Gematsu!)
Air Twister is a pretty interesting-looking shooter and was the first game released by Ys Net following Shenmue III. It caught our attention last year because of its similarities to Space Harrier, and Suzuki has also cited numerous influences from Sega rail shooters such as Panzer Dragoon and Rez. Instead of piloting a spaceship, you're a princess who rides a swan all while over-the-top music complete with choir singing (from Dutch composer Valensia) blast out of the speakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flight from mobile
ININ has announced that they’ll be bringing YSNET’s absolutely bizarre shoot-’em-up, Air Twister, to consoles and PC. Previously, this was an Apple Arcade exclusive. It will be arriving on November 10, 2023.
Do you not even have phone? I do, but I rarely play phone. So, typically, when something like Air Twister gets announced, the news just bounces off of me and gets filed away in the trash compactor of my mind. So, when I got the PR for this, I was like, “I’ve seen this before,” but I couldn’t place it. I had to look up news of it, and thankfully, CJ plays phone and had written about it previously.
So, there’s this trailer, and I really can’t tell what the hell is going on, so I’m just going to quote what the press release tells me, “In Air Twister, embark on an epic quest with Princess Arch as she fights to save her planet from imminent destruction.”
https://youtu.be/-eUpnDtU274
Okay, cool, now explain the winged elephant to me.
Yu Suzuki is the mind behind Space Harrier, After Burner, Out Run, and Shenmue. One of those games is among my favorite titles ever, and it’s probably not the one that you’re thinking of.
I can’t find a lot on Air Twister in terms of reviews, but the ones I do find are kind of lukewarm. However, CJ says it got much better after a few updates. I’d be willing to try it out myself once it’s off of phone. It looks absolutely insane. Like someone dropped a whole bunch of unrelated assets into a blender and hit “frappe.” I like insane.
Air Twister is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 10, 2023. PlayStation and Switch platforms will be getting a physical release, as well.

While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.
"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting," Abé tells me. "That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited to play Final Fantasy XVI for ages, but after hearing about Game of Thrones' influence on the game, I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed by dense fantasy lore. While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

When it comes to Nintendo, you never know if its consoles and handhelds will go out with a bang or with a whimper. The GameCube, for instance, went out with an absolute whimper, as new releases had all but dried up by the time the Wii arrived. Yes, it got Twilight Princess in the end, but it was pretty sparse otherwise. The Nintendo DS, on the other hand, went out with one hell of an explosion. In the months leading up to the release of the 3DS, publishers dropped an assortment of gems for the platform, including Okamiden, Radiant Historia, Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation, and Pokémon Black & White in North America and Europe. And that was just in the first three months of 2011 before the 3DS hit.

Is there such a thing as a perfect game? Yes, and it's this one. Listen, you are going to get to the end of this review and think to yourself, "Isn't a 10/10 score, like, Zelda: Breath of the Wild? How can this 12-15 hour game that doesn't even have Hestu in it possibly match up?" You are thinking that because you have not played Ghost Trick. Your life is about to change.
First up, a bit of background. Ghost Trick is a one-off, standalone game from the man behind Ace Attorney, Shu Takumi. Originally released on the DS in 2010, it received a fair amount of praise from critics, but never went on to become a bestseller. Instead, it lodged deep in the hearts of everyone who did play it, becoming a cult favourite amongst those in the know, alongside other, similar(ly underappreciated) games from the same era like Hotel Dusk, The World Ends With You, and Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

The hype for the remake of Resident Evil 4 may have died down, but it's still out there as one of the best horror games of the year. Upon release back in March, it sold millions in quick succession, showing Capcom was onto another winner.
In the interim, a lot of you have been waiting for the game's first major DLC, Separate Ways, which would be a remake of the content from the original RE4. We don't yet know when it's coming out, but eagle-eyed gamers think the developer is preparing for its launch.
Over on SteamDB (as spotted by Twitter user and known leaker Wario64), a website that tracks all things related to Steam, it looks as though Resident Evil 4 is getting seven new achievements added to the game. There are no details on what these achievements actually are as they're marked as hidden, but some speculate they could be related to the DLC.
https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1673334239352311814
Other theories suggest it could be in relation to the VR version of the Resident Evil 4 remake. All of these are, of course, speculations. Hopefully, Capcom will give further details at some point. In any case, it's something to keep a close eye on. It looks as though RE4 is preparing for a new patch, but we can't be sure of the details at this stage. We know Separate Ways is inbound, but these new Steam achievements suggest that it could be arriving sooner than anticipated.

A sequel to the Switch launch title, 1-2-Switch, might not have made it onto our bingo cards for Nintendo's post-Tears of the Kingdom 2023, but the rumours have been around for so long that we shouldn't have been all the surprised when Everybody 1-2-Switch! was announced with little fanfare in the early hours on a Friday morning. Except we were.
The first game delivered some harmless fun when the Switch was all fresh and new. It showcased some of the cool features that the console promised and filled a gap when there weren't all that many games available. But now, six years on and with enough games available to keep us going until the end of time, we couldn't help but wonder: do we really need a sequel any more?

Humble Games announced today that their battle focused Temtem: Showdown is now available to download for free on Steam. The game is essentially a standalone variant of the Pokémon-like Temtem that released out of early access last year. You do not need to purchase the previous Temtem game in order to access Temtem: Showdown.
[caption id="attachment_388841" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Humble Games[/caption]
Gotta battle em' all!
Temtem: Showdown takes out the taming and leveling from the base game, and focuses purely on the combat. Dubbed a "free multiplayer battle simulator", players can build a team in seconds and dash into ranked matches with players from all over the world. At its core, Temtem's battle system features action-packed 2v2 battles. It'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a bit of doubles in online Pokémon matches.
Competitive play seems to be a huge part of the game, featuring a climbable ranked ladder system. Furthermore, the game will have community-run tournaments as well as an official esports circuit called TemCS. According to to the Steam page, the circuit will reward huge prizes.
Seasons will also be a thing in Temtem: Showdown. There will be a new season every few months, changing up the meta and introducing new combinations to play with when doing battle.
I haven't got a chance to play Temtem yet, though it's in my backlog to play on PS5. I have heard great things about its battle system though, so this seems like the right idea to make it accessible to more players. While Temtem is available on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, it looks like Temtem: Showdown is only available via Steam for now.
If you want to give the game a try, you can check out Temtem: Showdown now for free on Steam.

We'd previously covered reports from eagle-eyed fans who claimed Barbie's cars would be making their way into Forza Horizon 5. His assessment was correct. Microsoft has just added both the Chevrolet Corvette that Barbie drives in the movie, as well as Ken's GMC HUMMER EV Pickup to Forza Horizon 5's drivable roster.
Microsoft has said that to get them both, all players have to do is check their Forza Horizon 5 message center. Everything for free, no paid DLC. Just get the cars and let's go party.

Some could have jumped at the opportunity to complain that they wanted *insert name of edgy, bat-themed vehicle here* and not this. But the Chevrolet is no slouch.

And it looks pretty damn good in photo mode.
https://twitter.com/JewelsVEVO/status/1673361123352129536?s=20
Anyone who's not into giving Barbie's preferred ride a chance can go with the much more aggressive HUMMER Pickup.

As the unexpectedly great box-office war of Barbie vs Oppenheimer draws ever nearer, Barbie reveals she has no trouble fighting on the most unexpected of fronts. Is this how Greta Gerwig's live-action take on the popular doll will take down Christopher Nolan's three-hour-long wartime drama? Will Fortnite soon host an event showing the horrendous effects of nuclear weapons as Nolan tries to win the gamer populace back? Only time will tell. Oppenheimer opens in theatres on July 20. Barbie catches up to him in her Chevy just one day later, on July 21.
As for the Forza Horizon 5 cars, you can download those right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HDMI 2.1 monitors were the new hotness back when the new generation of games consoles arrived in 2020 and 2021, with these models offering 4K 120Hz HDR gaming without the need for chroma subsampling. Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. 
Two or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs.

        <updated>2023-06-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

Showdown was the mode's name; something for the animal fight pit lovers in the room, rather than the plain old animal lovers. That mode has now been spun into a free standalone release aptly called Temtem Showdown, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between the Super Mario Bros. Movie and several announcements during last week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo's mascot is having a great 2023. Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.
The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

The confusion began yesterday, June 25, when Bethesda's support Twitter account tweeted that all physical versions of the upcoming game would include a code instead of a disc, a message that was later deleted without clarification. You can read all about that in the original version of this post below, but that same support account responded this afternoon with a link to a June 11 blog post detailing the release details and stating...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team of modders working to remaster The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim’s engine have released a hefty roadmap video, updating us on all the work they have left to do before Skyblivion’s 2025 release window. As well as development updates, the new video (embedded below) contains plenty of glimpses at Skyblivion’s nostalgic landscapes. Come take a look at fancy Cyrodiil down below, which looks exactly how I remember Oblivion looking (until I looked at actual Oblivion again.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week while I was away from my desk, Pete Hines showed that the Starfield hype train is an unstoppable perpetual motion engine, and he certainly won't pull the emergency break for something as normie as a federal court. While his comments were part of the ongoing Actiblizz acquisition malarkey (the point seemingly being "it's so big it'd be too hard to optimise for PS5"), hearing him pitch Bethesda's upcoming grey-rocks-but-in-space-this-time RPG as "irresponsibly large" made me want to go full Reggie Perrin.
Every time I bring my reviews of giant games to the altar of the industry, I weep tears of blood and beg that games be shorter. And every time the golden idol with the face of Phil Spencer opens its maw to spit a new £80 disc out and says: "Bigger than ever before. A million pointless collectibles. A feast of zero-calorie content. Lol. Lmao."

Amidst all the madness though, one indie has been able to blast through the noise to become a smash hit on Steam - only sitting behind CS:GO on the sales charts - and potentially one of this year’s biggest shooters. That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments.

The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

Seeing all the great demos this week has made me far more excited about the future of video games than any of the notE3 streams did the other week, and I'm not gonna lie, a large part of my excitement stems from the brilliant Let's! Revolution!, a beautifully animated tile-based roguelite that has a touch of Minesweeper about it. I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn't enough to really get across just how excellent this is.

This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Sonic Central stream to celebrate the anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Sonic Team announced that the second free content update on Sonic Frontiers' 2023 roadmap, titled Sonic's Birthday Bash, is available today. The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an absolute riot playing Killer Frequency. It’s a first-person puzzle horror where you're trying to help folks escape a rampaging murderer. Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

The injunction would further prevent Microsoft's acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox's high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick's revenue share demands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a bunch of reasons I like The Tartarus Key (enough to make it our RPS Game Club pick this month), and one of them is that it's not actually scary. Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

It's been emotional whiplash for some PC fans. A PC version was specified in the game's announcement trailer, and then FF16 producer Yoshi-P walked it back and said that didn't happen, and then Yoshi-P addressed his previous words and said he'd like to bring the game to PC eventually. Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-22T19:17:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

I really enjoyed my time with it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI.

While Sonic Mania was a 2D platformer, the studio's first game under their new name brings them into the realm of 3D, taking an incredibly vibrant colour palette that would certainly work in any classic Sonic game, and marrying it a world that one could say is mildly reminiscent of the hedgehog's rival Mario.

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

And one of the main reasons I enjoyed my 65+ hours with it was the combat. It’s fast-paced and bombastic and continues to grow more and more robust as you play through the game’s story. 
However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

The match was too close to call – 1990 to 1995 – but I wasn't keeping track. All that stood between my team and victory was a chubby crocodile with a vacuum. I danced and jumped around him as he used his big belly and Luigi's Mansion-like hoover to bounce me around like a loose piece of cat fluff. I just needed a few moments to deposit my Wumpa Fruit, and victory would be ours. I had my blinders on, and that was a mistake. The enemy team's Wumpa Fruit meter quickly filled to 2000, and the match was over. My…]]></summary>

The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

There are flayed corpses everywhere, fathers are haunted by the ghosts of their dead sons, blokes cram flaming eyeballs into their skulls and sometimes a guy turns up at random just to stomp you (and a lot of other people) into fleshy jam on the ground. Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

Guttural sounds echoed from ebony nests; pounding steps grew louder the longer my marines stayed still. While not a survival-horror title, Aliens: Dark Descent masterfully bottles the franchise’s menacing ambiance. It comes packaged as a solid squad-management XCOM-lite puffing a new terrifying style.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

"Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various "effects" of a non-culinary nature.

Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here. For a funny take on the poses Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard wishes the Tears of the Kingdom Link took instead, head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Nintendo Direct ended with the reveal of a new 2D Mario game called Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Before you ask, this is not a new “New” Super Mario Bros. This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous. 
Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Rocksteady have revealed Batman: Arkham Trilogy, a new trilogy collection that brings Batman: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight to Switch later this year. 
More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch on November 3.]]></summary>

As you might expect, Penny's Big Breakaway is a colorful platformer with a focus on movement and traversal. Here's the game's full description:
"In this 3D platforming adventure, you’ll explore the bright and colorful world of Macaroon, and help Penny and Yo-Yo escape the clutches of the grouchy Emperor Eddie. Perform stylish, acrobatic tricks to avoid Eddie’s massive horde of pushy penguins in Story Mode. Power up Yo-Yo to protect Penny and put your speed running skills to the test in Time Attack Mode to unlock special items and complete secret stages."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

While we don't have a great sense of the game's plot or features, we'd wager there's plenty of investigative gameplay and puzzle-solving.


The first Detective Pikachu launched in 2016 for 3DS and was adapted into a live-action film in 2019.  We'll have to watch out to learn more about this follow-up in the coming weeks.]]></summary>

Nintendo announced this during today's Nintendo Direct, stopping short of really any details beyond that. The company didn't reveal a name or any details about gameplay, but it did actually show gameplay and it looks exactly how you'd expect. We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.
One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

The stand-off reached the boiling point in March when broadcasters formed a new anti-piracy coalition and warned of punishing legal action. Noonoo TV responded by throwing in the towel but after clone site 'Noonoo TV Season 2' appeared online, the government says it will develop an AI anti-piracy system that will stop any 'Season 3' variants in their tracks.

It's around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. 
We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol will be getting its first and only bit of story DLC next week, which Striking Distance are describing as the game's "heart-pounding final chapter". Entitled Final Transmission, a short teaser trailer has been released giving us a look at what protagonist Jacob Lee will be getting up to, but it doesn't really show us all that much. There seems to be some kind of fleshy robot monster that says he'll "never escape," but that's all we've got to go off right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming expansion pack for Sonic Origins (aptly named Sonic Origins Plus) appears to be out in the wild early ahead of its launch on June 23rd, but fans don't seem to be particularly happy with the game's sound quality. The Plus expansion will bring remastered visuals, bonus characters, new modes and challenges to the original Sonic Origins compilation, but it's the audio quality of the 12 new Sonic Game Gear additions that fans seem to have taken issue with. As spotted by TheGamer, fans who have got their hands on copies of the game early, such as YouTuber belmont gr, are reporting that the Game Gear games sound off, like there's some kind of echo effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the game's release in August, Baldur's Gate 3 has received a prequel murder mystery game that lets you vote on how things unfold. Playable for free in your browser, it's titled Blood in Baldur's Gate, and is set 15 years before the events of Baldur's Gate 3. Developer Larian Studios revealed the project yesterday. In it, you play as a detective tasked with solving a murder, and by you, I quite literally mean all of you, as this one will take a bit of collaboration.

But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I'm honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I'm therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

Tales & Tactics, in case you’ve forgotten, is best pitched as a mixture of Slay the Spire and Dota Auto Chess; in other words, it’s a fantasy roguelike (like StS), where you can pick up abilities, gear and whatnot during each run, with auto-battling combat (like Auto Chess) - except here it’s on a hex board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
