Surprise! It's me, a bit earlier in the week than usual. I have to leave town for a few days, so you get a super fun stream today instead of Friday! Our stream today is the new adventure game Stray, in which you get to run around a cybercity as a cat causing all sorts of mischief.

I know I've been promising Bloodborne, and honest to goodness have tried to get it working for so long, but it still needs a little TLC so we're shooting for next week again. So many tech issues, huh? Hoping for a smooth and cozy stream tonight. See you there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cole's Legacy is free to claim
As time goes on, it's shockingly easy for DLC to get lost in the cracks, even for a series as well-known as inFAMOUS. While Sucker Punch Productions recently went on record to say that the team isn't working on a new inFAMOUS (or Sly Cooper) game right now, there is a bit of news: some DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son popped up on the PlayStation Store.
If you were browsing the storefront today to see what's new, this "July 20" release would've been a head-turner — but the DLC in question, Cole's Legacy, is not new for inFAMOUS Second Son. These missions were originally a part of the limited edition.
In a move that other studios should try and follow, Sucker Punch has released Cole's Legacy for free in "most regions, except those that require a small fee due to local restrictions," so you can claim the DLC right now on the PlayStation Store. Might as well!

https://youtu.be/T4XlJrbY3ow
Play it for the jacket, if anything
It's worth going through if you have a deep personal history with inFAMOUS and inFAMOUS 2; Zeke's back, kinda, but the scope is admittedly limited. The main thing: if you complete Cole's Legacy, you'll be able to dress up Second Son star Delsin with Cole's jacket.
On Twitter, Sucker Punch also confirmed that it hopes to separately release Fetch's D.U.P. outfit — a former pre-order bonus — for inFAMOUS First Light. And maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC (user-generated content) servers has wrapped up, as promised.
Games often tie outfits or smaller pieces of content to pre-orders, first-wave "day one" editions, and collector's sets. It can be a way to incentivize early adoption without going overboard. The problem is, some of this stuff is never offered again, and it becomes lost to time. In cases like this, it's never too late to make it right — fans will be thankful.
They'd also appreciate remasters of the PS3 games. Just saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2021 movie's director could be returning to the chair
The sequel to Mortal Kombat (2021) could be seeing a familiar face at the helm. Deadline reports that Simon McQuoid is set to return to the Mortal Kombat follow-up.
McQuoid made his feature film directorial debut on Mortal Kombat, which hit both theaters and HBO Max last year.
We got confirmation in January that New Line Cinema had reportedly greenlit the sequel. Deadline also reports that Moon Knight writer Jeremy Slater is writing the screenplay for the Mortal Kombat sequel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBa_aHwCbC4
No other details are known about the follow-up just yet.
A new tournament
It's little surprise we're seeing a follow-up. Mortal Kombat did pretty well, especially considering its simultaneous streaming and theater debut.
The 2021 film even left off on a cliffhanger, with Raiden saying he wanted to train up a new roster of fighters. Film character Cole is seen setting off for Los Angeles, possibly in search of a certain movie star with some martial arts prowess.
While it certainly had some high points and some dips, I overall enjoyed my time with the new Mortal Kombat. It had some good action and fight scenes. The Scorpion vs. Sub Zero fight scene was worth admission on its own.
Meanwhile, the video game adaptation train carries on at full speed. The HBO Last of Us production looks set for next year, and Sonic the Hedgehog continues to break the box office with even more in the works. Heck, even Duke Nukem might be getting in on the silver screen bandwagon.
Considering that Mortal Kombat turned out pretty okay compared to other video game adaptations, I'm game to see a new one and find out where Cole's story goes from here. Though hopefully it doesn't fall down the same animal-shaped potholes that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation did.

For long-time fans of Naughty Dog, seeing industry vet Bruce Straley step away from game development in 2017 was a pretty devastating loss — he played a huge role in making Uncharted 2, Uncharted 4, and The Last of Us, after all. Now, five years later, Straley has just announced that he will be jumping back into the world of game development by forming his very own studio known as Wildflower Interactive.
"Wildflower starts with everything I created, pushed and learned about gameplay, characters and story, and directing teams while at Naughty Dog — but applied to a smaller studio to keep communication easy and creatively fluid," Straley says.
"I’ve surrounded myself with an amazing group — some new faces, some old colleagues — that are pushing our concepts of what kind of game we want to create, the process we use to make it, the kind of team and culture we all want to be a part of, and what giving back to our industry ultimately looks like."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMEgkVZTLIM
Straley even created a video to give us a little insight into his process of creating the studio, which all started with an idea that he and some colleagues were bouncing around. When they realized that that game was something they had to make, well, that's how Wildflower was born.
As someone who really admires Straley's work, it's really cool to not only see him return, but to see him looking genuinely happy to do so. Based on ideas he's shared in the past for the kinds of games he wants to make, I'll be interested to see how Wildflower shakes things up in the future.
Straley said that the studio is going to "go silent for a bit" to "focus on building the team and game," but I know we'll have a ton to look forward to from them in the future.

Publisher Microids and developer Oddworld Inhabitants have announced that 2021 sequel Oddworld: Soulstorm is preparing to bring its quirky adventure and grim fantasy world to the Nintendo Switch platform in the form of Oddworld: Soulstorm Odditimized Edition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yvwwcwFe74
Already available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, Oddworld: Soulstorm is the sequel to 2014's Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty and is itself a "reimagining" of the 1998 release Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. The side-scrolling stealth adventure tells the story of Mudokan Abe as he once again risks life and limb to protect the sanctity of his people from armies of greedy, capitalist overlords. Outnumbered and outgunned, Abe must use cunning, guile, scavenged goods, and his fellow escapees in order to turn fortune in his favor, lest his race is wiped out by the miserable Glukkons.

In addition to the Nintendo Switch port news, Microids also revealed two physical "odditions" that are also in production. A standard Limited Oddition includes a physical boxed copy of Oddworld: Soulstorm, three art prints, and a metal carry case that holds up to 24 Switch cartridges. For die-hard fans, the Collector's Oddition includes the aforementioned items, but also adds a hardcover art book, a keychain, sticker sheet, and a figurine of our hero in full-on tiptoe mode.
Pre-order customers will also receive a digital soundtrack as well as a digital version of the art book. While pre-orders for the physical odditions are live, Microids seem a little closed on where exactly the physical version can be pre-ordered — with different territories carrying different participating retailers. In addition, neither a price nor a release date for the Switch edition of Oddworld: Soulstorm is available.

We're well into summer, and that means scorching days, soothing Seals & Crofts, and lots of gaming deals. The PlayStation Store Summer Sale started today with over a thousand deals on PS4 and PS5 games lasting through Wednesday, August 3 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific.
The bulk of the sale is going to be older stuff, naturally — but a few newer releases stand out in the crowd. Supermassive Games' cinematic horror romp The Quarry, Sloclap's tense martial arts brawler Sifu, Saber Interactive's team-based Evil Dead: The Game, and Team Ninja's super eclectic Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin are worth a nod.
With an eye toward games with new low pricing, here are some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quit bugging me
Obsidian Entertainment's well-received backyard adventure Grounded is set to receive a TV adaptation. The animated series is currently in pre-production as a joint venture between Bardel Entertainment, Kinetic Media, and SC Productions. A premiere date was not announced.
"Grounded has caught the imagination of millions of people and we've learned that the biggest fans want even more of that world," said game director Adam Brennecke in a press release. "This partnership will allow us to give fans more Grounded while expanding the world that so many have come to love."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsUvQaTi6nc
The Grounded show will, much like its video game counterpart, tell the story of a group of kids forced to fend themselves against bugs and critters of all shapes and sizes when they are shrunken down via some mysterious and unstable technology. And if fending off gargantuan wasps, spiders, ants, and beetles weren't enough, the kids must find a way to return to full size in order to expose a conspiracy threatening the entire town... Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids meets All the President's Men. Probably.
Grounded will be written by Brent Friedman (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Star Trek: Enterprise) and directed by Brien Goodrich (Halo). A special panel is set to take place at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) where the first details about the show, its premise, characters, and cast are likely to be outlined. Production for the Grounded TV show is in its infancy, so it is very unlikely that we'll see it hit our screens until later in 2023 at the very earliest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

These custom-painted Animal Crossing sneakers look so good, I initially thought they were an official product — but nope! They're actually a project from artist kelfunncheng.
In the 10-ish-minute video below, which is really down-to-earth to the point where the process actually seems feasible, they walk us through how they managed to craft the shoes. Talking us through, kelfunncheng says that this is their first time painting shoes, and they wanted to document the entire process.
There's a lot of preparation involved, including cleaning up the shoes, and taping them up. The creator practiced on several household objects to test shades/color mixing, as well as a general painting technique. Again, it's a really relatable video, as they even talk through a few minor issues before getting started (like how the air hose was loose, which prevented air from coming out of the brush); including stuff that might actually happen to a normal person trying it themselves.
The kicker? This was all spurred on as a gift for their sister. Wholesome! Animal Crossing is so ubiquitous (especially after New Horizons) that I feel like you could theoretically give anyone a gift of something based out of this universe and they'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life in space
Hello Games is back with another big update, this time addressing freighters. The massive hub ships get an overhaul in the Endurance Update for No Man's Sky today, making space-base life even cooler.
The Endurance Update takes a huge rework to the freighter bases of No Man's Sky. New parts and themed rooms with customization options let you design the Normandy, Rocinante, or Enterprise of your dreams.
Specialist crew will also now walk around your base, having thoughts and patrolling the area. Agricultural Modules let players build a farm on their ship, taking Stardew Valley into the stars. And freighter exteriors can get some observation decks and catwalks for a little out-of-ship sightseeing stroll, too.

Base-building also gets a few quality-of-life updates, like preview holograms showing up through walls. Existing base parts can be replaced without deleting their old spots, so you don't have to worry too much about snapping on just right.
Plus, the universe gets even more beautiful with enhanced nebulae and black holes. Asteroids get a little more varied too, adding a bit more for the miners out there. And if you like creepy stuff, well, you can seek out some organic frigates too.
Home, home among the stars
Of course, alongside the big updates to freighters and celestial forces, there are also a ton of other small touch-ups and quality-of-life improvements. Hello Games keeps carrying on with No Man's Sky updates, building up and up with each new update, like clockwork.
The space life sim is also expected to arrive on Nintendo Switch on October 7, 2022. After seeing these huge freighters and vast ship layouts, I'm pretty intrigued to see how this universe manages to squeeze onto the Switch. Until then, the Endurance Update is live for all platforms that No Man's Sky is available on today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect Fit
Fashion label RSVLTS has expanded its range of pop-culture-themed apparel with a new line of shirts based on Capcom's genre-defining release Street Fighter II. The new shirts feature designs that reflect the style, characters, and aesthetic of the 1991 fighting game that changed the industry forever.
There are three designs in the RSVLTS Street Fighter line: "Knockout Zones," which features various World Warrior sprites against a collage of classic stages; "Super Combos," which features stylized depictions of characters such as E Honda and Zangief set amongst input terminology; and finally "Art of Ansatsuken," which sports a collage of Ryu and Ken in artwork recognizable from the Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo, and Super Street Fighter II series.

Each shirt features a button-down, short sleeve design, and is crafted from the company's trademark "Kunuflex" material, which offers a snug fit with some give for fabric stretch. Available in sizes XS to 4XL, each shirt retails for $68 USD, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. You can check out the shirts and their designs, along with a detailed measurement guide, over on the RSVLTS website.
While they are all a little too brightly colored to be seen on yer favorite aging, gaming Goth, I will admit that I do like the "Super Combos" design — I dig that summery shade of green. In addition to the Street Fighter shirts, RSVLTS also produces clothing that features iconic brands such as TMNT, The Goonies, Marvel and DC Comics, and Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming August 12
Sony has provided new details for the Spider-Man PC port via a PC edition trailer, including confirmation of an unlocked framerate, among other goodies.
Set to arrive on August 12, it'll feature a new graphical setting suite, including the aforementioned unlocked framerate, on top of ray-tracing for reflections and shadows, and ultra-wide monitor support. Here's the description straight from Sony:
"Enjoy a variety of graphics quality options to tailor to a wide range of devices, unlocked framerates, and support for other technologies including performance boosting NVIDIA DLSS and image quality enhancing NVIDIA DLAA."

Beyond that there's haptic feedback and DualSense controller support for wired USB users, as well as "full mouse and keyboard support" with customizable controls. You can get a look at all that in the trailer, embedded below.
Oh, and if you're going this route, here are the pre-order bonuses for the Spider-Man PC port:
Iron Spider Suit
Velocity Suit
Spider-Punk Suit
"Early access" to the Spider-Drone Gadget
5 skill points that you can use at the start of the game
Of course, mods are part of the package too! Thankfully you'll have options, as it'll be available on both Steam and Epic Games. Note, however, that all these upgrades come with a $60 price tag. The current market rate for a new copy of the game (Game of the Year Edition) on PS4 is around $30 physical, $20 digital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of it covers the first five hours
Nintendo just debuted a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview video on the company's Japanese YouTube account, and it's pretty comprehensive! Despite the fact that it's in Japanese, it's actually very easy to tell what's going on.
Here's what the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview touches on, vaguely:
Intercut big picture/conflict story elements, and the war between the two major factions
The interpersonal relationships between the six core party members
Lots of footage of overworld exploration
An in-depth look at combat, the different roles, combos, and swapping between party members
The Ouroboros system unveiled in one of the first debut videos
The "guest" party system (this is arguably the most spoiler-heavy part, as it showcases a ton of characters at once)
Township wandering/camp use/gemcrafting
A season pass recap and an amiibo support explanation (ours is more informational!)
In other Xenoblade-related news, Nintendo even came out with a digital calendar for July, which has a cheeky marked-off spot on July 29 to celebrate the release of the game. To grab it you'll need to spend 50 My Nintendo platinum points (just remember that it's a digital download, not a physical calendar).
Hopefully we'll get some news as to what the My Nintendo physical reward is soon enough! Typically that info comes within seven days of the game's release, give or take a week.
[Update: As of July 20, Nintendo has provided a new English version of the trailer. You can find the original Japanese video and the additional English one below.]

Yesterday saw Britain hit with the highest temperatures the country has ever recorded, part of an increasing, (and highly worrying), weather crisis that is battering Europe. In response to the climate, Valve has issued a warning regarding the use of its recent handheld PC hardware, Steam Deck.
In a statement issued by the developer/publisher, Valve noted that the Steam Deck, though a hardy piece of kit, is designed to work at ambient temperatures sub-35°C. Should the exterior temperature reach or even exceed this level, the Steam Deck will being to throttle its own performance in order to prevent damage to its fine circuitry and physical infrastructure.
https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1549467955754217473?s=20&t=iyPzzCRj5_boiWyTHofp5g
Should temperatures climb even higher, with the internal APU (Accelerated Processor Unit) reaching anywhere the real of 100°C, then the Steam Deck may shut down entirely, in order to prevent both itself and the user from potential injury. It's incredibly powerful tech, no doubt about it, but it sure ain't indestructible. Nintendo recently issued similar warnings regarding its own handheld platform, Nintendo Switch, given the players' penchant for using the respective hardware when out and about.
So, if you're lucky enough to have already received your Steam Deck, take it easy this summer. And that goes for yourself too. Stay cool, stay hydrated*, and stay well away from the midday sun. And for those of you still waiting on your own little black box, Valve recently noted that it intends to double the output of Steam Deck deliveries over the remainder of 2022.
Disclaimer: Your Steam Deck/Nintendo Switch DOES NOT need to stay hydrated.

        <updated>2022-07-20T15:30:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November seems likely
Thanks to a modification in the Steam listing (spotted by Comicbook), we could have a hint as to what the Sonic Frontiers release date might be.
According to SteamDB, the date was modified from a September placeholder to November 8, which is a Tuesday. From there it was changed to December 3 (a Saturday), likely to throw folks off the scent. In any case, it's likely that we won't see Sonic Frontiers until way later in the year, with the "holiday 2022" claim holding true.
So looking back at the last batch of prior 3D Sonic games, I think we can see a pattern here:
Sonic Forces - November, 2017
Sonic Lost World - October, 2013
Sonic Generations - November, 2011
Sonic Colors - November, 2010
Clearly, Sega likes to get these games out right before Christmas, as Sonic is a family affair. November 8 completely makes sense from multiple angles. It's the right time for the iron to strike from a sales perspective, though it will be competing with God of War Ragnarok and Skull and Bones on that same day.
That said, Sonic has a pretty long tail and isn't directly at war with either of those games. It might get tougher competition a few weeks later on November 18 when Pokemon Scarlet and Violet hit, but early November would give Sega some time to polish Frontiers before it gets ready to ship. In any case, if Sega is still sticking to "holiday 2022," we'll find out the Sonic Frontiers release date soon enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But where's muh gurl Tisiphone?
Supergiant's fantastic action-RPG Hades is custom designed for merchandise, thanks to its attractive visuals, cool aesthetic style, strong colors, and varied cast of memorable characters. Bafflingly, however, Hades gear has been incredibly hard to come by, with nary an art book or pair of Zubaz pants in sight.
Enter merch-makers Fangamer, who has finally decided, two years after release, to bless fans of Zagreus and his Hades brethren with a fun line of items styled after the game's underworld denizens. While the full line is yet to be revealed, a teaser image appears to include long and short-sleeved shirts, art prints, and a badge set featuring Nyx, Thanatos, Megaera, and, of course, Zagreus himself. No Artemis or Tis, but it's fine.
https://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1549439138587222016?s=20&t=GrFE6W8m9nXAia2XjKzXrg
Perhaps best of all, the image features plush dolls of two of The House of Hades' most important employees: three-headed, bone-munching Good Boy Cerberus, and the lovely, hardworking, and ever-fangirling housemaid, Dusa. Better still, the Dusa plush talks! Yes, I will be purchasing both of them.
Hopefully, the full range will include further shirt designs and/or other cool gubbins, but I'm still stunned by the possibility that Hades is yet to receive a lavish, hardcover art book — which seems an absolute given for such a striking-looking release. Regardless, the fun-looking Hades range is set to launch on the Fangamer site on Tuesday, July 26.
For my wallet, There is No Escape.

Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's surmised that the X/X-2 remaster sold nearly seven million
Final Fantasy X sales (and that's the series itself, including Final Fantasy X-2) have hit the 20.8 million mark since September 2021, Square Enix reports (via Gematsu).
As Gematsu points out, in October of 2013, the publisher noted that all together, the X series had hit the 14 million unit mark. To sum things up, that means that the X/X-2 HD Remaster, across the PC, PS3, PS4, Vita (!), Switch, and Xbox One platforms sold roughly 6.8 million copies in nearly nine years (the remaster collection came out in December of 2013).
It's crazy to see the amount of love this series has gotten since release. When it came out I silently played it while a ton of people I knew skipped it, wrote it off, or played it and didn't like it: take your pick! All of them were some sort of rebuke of Final Fantasy X in some form, and I felt like I was the crazy one for enjoying it so much.
Fast forward to 2022 and it has the respect it deserves. Many lists of "top Final Fantasy games" put it near the top, or refer to it as a classic. I guess XIII helped codify that classic status a bit, but I'll take the affirmation that I was always right about this game all the same!

Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jonat is wandering around in the pitch black while everyone sleeps, even though he is: a) afraid of the dark, and b) a baby. This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you built Atari today?
Following on from the creative success of its previous LEGO Nintendo Entertainment System kit, The LEGO Company has released pictures of its next blocktastic console throwback, the LEGO Atari 2600, which will launch on August 1 at the typically princely price of $239.99.
"The Atari 2600 was one of the most memorable gifts I got as a kid," writes LEGO designer Chris McVeigh in a press release. "This is why it’s been such an incredible experience to bring two icons together, Atari and Lego, in this awesome set. We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure."

The LEGO Atari 2600 (Build number #10306) features a grand total of 2,532 bricks and consists of a replica of the 1977 home console, alongside its famous one-button joystick, a small stack of game cartridges (complete with stacking tower), and, as a neat touch, additional builds based on classic hits Asteroid, Centipede, and Adventure, the latter of which you might remember from the interminable third act of Steven Spielberg's disasterpiece, Ready Player One.
But that's not all, as flipping up the console body will reveal a cute little diorama of a 1980s video game fan enjoying some 2600 action in a retro-themed apartment. This is a really neatly nostalgic release from The LEGO Company, with the natural hard-edged design of the 2600 console, its cartridges, and even its graphics fitting suitably within LEGO's brick-based style. The finished console sits just under 13 inches wide, three inches tall, and nine inches deep.

Honestly, I'd take this over an Atari VCS any day.
The LEGO Atari 2600 set will be available to purchase on August 1.

When I cracked into Stray for the first time, I didn't think I'd have to worry about how best to zig-zag, juke, and even "drift" as a cat — but when a coveted trophy is on the line, everything's on the table. Half an hour of failed attempts and several slow-mo guide videos later, I've finally gotten Can't Cat-ch Me, a simple yet deceptively hard trophy.
It's one of the earliest trophies/achievements you can (theoretically) get in Stray, but I'm here to say that it might be best to save it until after you've finished the game. It could put you into a sour mood if you try to force it, so don't let it gnaw away. Come back later.

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been a pretty troubled development. It's been delayed, lost leads, changed hands, and more. Today, we did get some reassurances that Bloodlines 2 is still in development, though we may not be seeing the results of that as soon as some would like.
Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester recently responded to concerned Bloodlines 2 fans on Twitter. Wester assured that Bloodlines 2 is in development, and more will be revealed when they are ready. He reiterated the statement on his timeline, with a follow-up: "The game is in good hands and we look forward to showing you more when the team and the game is ready."

An open-world fishing game with online co-op could really hit the spot in a "dad game" sort of way, and Call of the Wild: The Angler isn't far off with a planned August 31, 2022 release on PC across Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store.
Along with a short trailer, the creators detailed the game's "launch map," Golden Ridge Reserve, which draws inspiration from scenic northwest Wyoming.

If you missed the recent announcement, Call of the Wild: The Angler has drop-in, drop-out multiplayer, which is ideal for maximum fishing vibes. Whether it's real or virtual fishing, our patience will never be perfectly in sync — so call it a day and pack it in as needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making the most of Ms. Chalice
There are significantly harder challenges to topple in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course than the Pawns, but for such a seemingly simple fight, I sure struggled with these leaping maniacs. Just... parry their heads 'til they fall off. How hard could it be? Well, it's a frantic scene, doubly so in co-op when you're trying to stay on the same page amid the chaos.
As it turns out, there's a faster (and potentially easier) way to beat the Pawns in Cuphead, and it would've been nice to know before I took on the all-in-one-go King's Gauntlet.
The strat: Playing as Ms. Chalice, it's possible to double-jump, bounce off a falling pawn's head with her forward-dashing parry, then gain enough height to reach the top of the screen and continue the parry combo until it's checkmate, better luck next time.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cuphead/comments/w1lt6r/beat_the_rooks_without_touching_the_ground/
Here's a demonstration from Reddit user ERROR1010101010 (ignore the mislabel; they were "tired"), as well as a similar 10-second clear from Sarojam on YouTube. Again, you'll want to be Ms. Chalice — she's got an aerial advantage over Cuphead and Mugman.
I tested out the method, and sure enough, it's pretty slick. It took a handful of attempts to pull off — I struggled to keep track of Ms. Chalice up top — but it can work, and when it does, it's a super-fast clear. With practice and good positioning, it's repeatable.
It's been fun to talk about facing Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, yet I feel like the King's Leap bosses haven't been discussed as much. Did y'all steamroll them? The chaotic Pawns and the just-get-on-with-it-already Knight were the hardest of the pack for me.
By the way, did you rebind the controls? I could never finish Cuphead with the (pretty baffling) default dash/dodge input. I need that to be R1 or else.

If you haven't played Into the Breach before, well, you should probably fix that. It's a turn-based strategy game from the makers of FTL: Faster Than Light, and it blends roguelite loops and careful, strategic decision-making with massive kaiju battles. It rules.

Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets.

Publisher XSEED Games has locked in a date for No More Heroes 3 on a bevy of new platforms. No More Heroes 3 will hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 11, 2022.
The previously Nintendo Switch-exclusive game now has a date locked in for other platforms, as well as a special "Day 1 Edition" of the game. This version is available for pre-order through the XSEED store for $59.99, and contains a soundtrack, art book, and commemorative license plate.

Store pages aren't live yet for the other versions. XSEED says that more info about the digital editions of No More Heroes 3 will arrive at a later date.
A world without heroes
No More Heroes 3 was released last year, just for the Nintendo Switch. And while it was certainly a return to more of Travis Touchdown and his usual action and antics, it also had some technical hurdles to overcome.
Frequent load times were a point of contention in our review, and performance woes seemed to affect the general consensus. There's hope, then, that No More Heroes 3 arriving on platforms with more hardware power to spare could help smooth out those edges. XSEED and Grasshopper say that these new platforms will see improved HD visuals and framerates, as well as faster load times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdHpJ3TVio
But for some other players, this might be their chance to finally experience the next step of Travis Touchdown's journey. Though other games have since been ported around, this finally brings the third entry out to most gaming devices. It'll be on PS4 and PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and the Windows Store. The Xbox versions will support Smart Delivery, too.
For those hoping to finally see Travis leap onto next-gen consoles, the wait's not much longer. No More Heroes 3 hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 11.

"We are working tirelessly to achieve our vision for Star Wars: Hunters," said the studio. "Our ambition is to create a competitive battle arena game that will entertain for years to come. To ensure we meet the high expectations we are setting for fans globally and ourselves as developers we have made the decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U1Al2WmyVc
"We understand game delays are frustrating," continues the statement, "however, our top priority is ensuring players will have the best possible experience in the Arena. For those who have been able to join us in the soft launch, we truly appreciate your support and feedback as we work to make Star Wars: Hunters the best it can be. Thank you for your understanding and we'll see you in the arena."
This is, unfortunately, the second delay that Star Wars: Hunters has experienced since its initial reveal back in February 2021. At the time, Zynga had hoped to launch the title by the end of that year, but was forced to push the street date to 2022. This further delay is no doubt disheartening for the team who, like most studios, have been working under typically fragile conditions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Star Wars: Hunters will launch in 2023 as a free-to-play title on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.

Right now the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo hunt continues to be a mystery in the US, with no retailer sightings beyond the collector's edition: which comes with the lone Malzeno figure.
The others (the Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico) are nowhere to be found in the region.
Here's a quick recap of how the Sunbreak amiibo situation is going worldwide:
You can pre-order them now on Play-Asia or Amazon Japan, but they'll be shipping in late September/August depending on the retailer: some users are reporting that Play-Asia is canceling select pre-orders
Some UK/EU regions are reporting that they are available at retail, and are all out now with the releas…]]></summary>

The first free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League arrives this week. It's bolstering the cast with some classic Mario characters, and also adding some new gear and stadiums to mix up the action on the field.
Daisy and Shy Guy both join the Mario Strikers: Battle League roster on July 22, as part of the game's free update. Also included in the update is Knight Gear, a set of gear that focuses on shooting and strength, and the Desert Rain Stadium.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qaA3suXBk
Daisy is a Technique-type player who's difficult to knock down. Shy Guy, meanwhile, is an all-rounder. Personally, I just really dig Shy Guy's special shot. He basically turns himself into a bullet and launches himself at the ball, and it's fantastic.
More Mario sports
It looks like Mario Strikers: Battle League will carry on the usual model for Mario sports games on the Switch. Both Mario Tennis Aces and Mario Golf: Super Rush got a series of updates post-launch, adding characters and more options to the action. They were also free updates, which is a nice alternative to a DLC drip-feed.
It feels like Mario Strikers: Battle League is destined for a similar lifespan to those games. I do hope some of the post-launch content eventually addresses the lack of solo options noted in our review of Battle League. As much fun as beating your friends at Mario soccer is, having something to do on the road is nice too.
As for the character choices so far, Daisy and Shy Guy seem like fun additions. My petition: get some wild, out-there picks in the Mario Strikers roster. You just know Wiggler would be a wild addition to the lineup. Maybe even a guest character?
Mario Strikers: Battle League is out now on the Nintendo Switch.

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a vaguely Yakuza sort of way, we've been treated to our first glimpse of what's likely to be Yakuza 8. First spotted by Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura and his team posted a video of them touring Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's offices before he gets his face scanned by a wall of cameras. But before the face-scanning, they record snippets of the Yakuza: Like A Dragon lads having a heated discussion in a small apartment. Ichiban has a ponytail! Apparently, there's a new town? And I got my mum to translate some bits. Sorry mum.
The video in question sees Mikuru Asakura wandering about RGG's studios having a great time. First, he chats with Sega Sammy's President Haruki Satomi, who says that there's a new town in the next Yakuza game and reaffirms that they're developing a title outside of the Yakuza and Judgment series. Aside from that, it's a jovial enough chat with no more morsels of info to chase.
And then Asakura is given a proper tour of the development area by RGG representative Masayoshi Yokoyama, where he marvels at the sheer number of folks working on the game and the face motion capture on some dev screens. Then onto the juicy stuff, which sees the camera pan over what looks like Yakuza 8 footage. In it, we see Ichiban Kasuga (who now sports a pony tail instead of a wild mess of hair), Yu Nanba, and Koichi Adachi from Like A Dragon having a right old natter. Asakura even asks whether it's okay to be filming these bits, but Yokoyama gives him the go-ahead.

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I've found a new favourite show when it's impossible to stop watching. That feverish ferocity to see just one more episode is the best feeling. As Dusk Falls, an interactive story about a robbery gone wrong in Arizona, managed to evoke that feeling early on and carry it throughout my roughly seven-hour playthrough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring is challenging, it’s fair to say. That’s why the idea of tackling the game’s die-rise-repeat formula without taking a single hit and never levelling your character’s runes is pretty dang impressive. Well, Elden Ring streamer Ainrun managed to do that, and didn’t skip the Grafted Scion boss like other streamers. Nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

Part of that process involves introducing a skill tree, the first of its kind within the franchise.

"Combat with enemies is an important part of Sonic Frontiers," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says.

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Unity announced they were merging with mobile ads company ironSource, who are arguably best known for developing a malware installer in 2015. Unsurprisingly, game developers were not pleased. If that wasn't enough, however, Unity CEO John Riccitiello was interviewed by PocketGamer.biz on Wednesday, wherein he called developers who failed to plan monetisation strategies when creating their games were “some of the biggest fucking idiots”.

Grime must be eliminated and I am there to facilitate that request with water and power. But occasionally I succumb to frustration as something I consider pristine isn't determined clean by the little progress bar that usually pats me on the back for jobs well done.
Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn't expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I've identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you'll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

But I am absolutely shallow enough to be immediately invested in a game that implies my overarching goal will be to team up with Shohreh Aghdashloo. It turns out she's barely in it, but by the time I'd figured that out I was already won over.

Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.]]></summary>

The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

What do a murderous witch, a grandmother’s mysterious death, and demonic possession have in common? An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye. Despite having a strong premise, presentation, and core mechanic, the experience gets bogged down by flawed puzzle de…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.
When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suda51 and his development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, are the zany minds behind cult classic hits like The Silver Case, Killer 7, No More Heroes, and Lollipop Chainsaw. The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.
ロリポップチェーンソーリメイクに対し沢山のファンよりご質問を頂戴しましたのでお答えします…!!!

In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:
Are you excited to play the remake? What do you think of the statement? Let us know in the comments below.]]></summary>

Yes, previous birthday posts will tell you the site's official birthday is August 20th - the day RPS was fully unveiled to the world - but those same posts will also tell you the four RPS founders were mucking about with the site in secret for well over a month before that. It's also the date that's been etched into our Wikipedia page, which we all know is the true source of all knowledge.

Three tiers from cheapest to most expensive – Essential, Extra, and Premium – each offered downloadable games, with the latter two options providing game catalogs in the hundreds. According to the official PlayStation Blog, "the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus" drops for Extra and Premium members this month. Some of the titles include Stray and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. 
Your PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup for July includes:

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry | PS4
Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection | PS4
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected | PS4
Saints Row Gat out of Hell | PS4
Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition | PS5
Ice Age: Scrat's Nutty Adventure | PS4
Jumanji The Video Game | PS4
Paw Patrol on a Roll! | PS4
ReadySet Heroes | PS4
And finally, the classic catalog for Premium members includes:

        <updated>2022-07-13T15:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK.

Tempo RETBLEED není nijak závratné, na AMD Zen 2 (Ryzeny 3000 atd.) jsou data získávána rychlostí 3,9 kB/s, na Intel Coffee Lake (např. Core i7–8700) je to dokonce jen 219 B/s. V tuto chvíli je použitelnost útoku RETBLEED ověřena pro AMD Zen 1, 1+, 2 a Intel Core 6. až 8. generace (Skylake až Coffee Lake).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the word "simulator" in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don't let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games is known for its interactive horror narratives, including 2015's Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and, more recently, The Quarry. Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.
Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, "Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll." However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.
For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it.

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases.

It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical spin-off port Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD could well end up totally unplayable for people who own it. At the start of July, the publisher shared 15 getting-on-a-bit games they intended to shut down online services for, including access to bought DLC. Now, Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD, Space Junkies and Silent Hunter 5 have already been delisted from Steam at Ubisoft’s request, and won't be accessible from September 1st.

Hang on – stompy robot shooter Titanfall 2 was the only single-player game in the same universe as Apex so far. Could this be Titanfall 3 or something else entirely?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protect the innocent and uphold the law. That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting one of the best, and most underrated, Pokémon games from the Nintendo 64 library in Pokémon Puzzle League next week.
On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum's long journey to release nears its end, and after getting a release date and story trailer in May, curious fans can finally see what gameplay looks like in a new video. 
A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.]]></summary>
