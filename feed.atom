        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge SBC 4 is a new fodder challenge for you to complete in EA FC 25, and it comes amidst the second week of the Road to the Knockouts. 


EA Sports has been releasing plenty of these simple fodder challenges, which are easy to complete. You should have enough fodder to complete the SBC for free. It won't cost much if you have to buy some/all the fodder from the market. Let's take a look at how to complete the SBC, and what are the rewards waiting for you. 


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge SBC 4 tasks


The RTTK Challenge SBC 4 has only one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 4



Min. 3 Players from the same Club


Min. 4 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 70


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 12



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge SBC 4 solutions


The main focus is to use the cards that you've in your club to complete the challenge. Here's a solution you can use to finish the SBC for cheap. 



Mateus Quaresma 71


Morris ST 74


Andersen RW 70


Brown 69


Franklin CM 68


Torres CDM 71


Marta Carrasco 70


Ballisager CB 71


Morante CB 63


Oum Gouet 64


Shea GK 67



The cost of completing the SBC is approximately 2,500 coins (if you buy all the cards from the market). Using cards from your own collection will bring the price down. You'll earn a Tradeable Small Prime Electrum Players Pack after completing the challenge. 


The previous RTTK challenges have offered better rewards, but this one has the easiest conditions. The value of the pack is still higher than the cost of the fodder, and hence, you should complete the 4th SBC of the series as well.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

My first hour in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom left me with a single, unshakeable thought: God, Hyrule's prisons are terrible.
Yes, I was besotted with how traditional the whole thing felt and still somewhat in shock that I had a brand new Zelda game in my hands a mere 18 months after its predecessor. But all that went out of my mind the second I saw our titular hero get thrown into a cell. Come on, there's a flipping massive hole right above that bench that may as well have "Climb me!" etched into it!

Lynels are the most fearsome of monsters found in Hyrule, and while it’s no small task to find and beat, it’s well worth the trouble. If you need help adding the Lynel to your array of echoes, we’re here to help.


Lynel location in Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 


The only Lynel in the game is found in the Eternal Forest, in the clearing in the northeast corner. If you have the waypoint in the forest activated, you can head south and then east from there. It’s very close.

Where to find Smog in Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom


Smog can be found inside the Eastern Temple, as the temple’s boss. Since this is an option dungeon, you won’t come across it during the main storyline, so if you want to fight this boss make sure you seek it out on your own. It’s just to the east of Seesyde Village.

What is the Bulwark buff in Remnant 2?


As the name of this buff implies, Bulwark is a defensive buff that gives you a stacking, duration-based damage reduction, helping you stay alive even in the direst of situations. Its usefulness depends on how you wield it in your build, as it very much wants to be stacked up quickly to gain its full effectiveness. A single stack of Bulwark is not noticeable, but if you find ways of stacking up, you can turn into a literal tank while the buff is active.

As if things weren’t weird enough, Ken suddenly finds himself cursed and missing a very personal part of his anatomy. Now, with the stakes quite literally close to home, he and Momo must work together to recover Ken’s “family jewels” while navigating a bizarre mix of the paranormal and extraterrestrial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[File this under "news no one expected." 343 Industries has confirmed that Halo Infinite is getting a third-person mode, and it's coming sooner than you think, with a release date penned in for November.


Halo historians will know that Combat Evolved was a third-person shooter at one point in its development. Now, well over two decades later, that idea is set to become a reality in Halo Infinite.

Halo Infinite third-person mode confirmed


343 Industries confirmed the addition of third-person mode to Halo Infinite in a video on Twitter. It's an announcement that wouldn't feel out of place on April Fools' Day. Halo? Third-person?! I assure you, it's real, and frankly, it looks like a lot of fun.


The clips from the gameplay were marked as a work in progress, but a couple of interesting tidbits can be garnered from what has been shown so far.




One moment shows the player transitioning from first to third-person, indicating that you're not locked into one view for the entire match. It remains to be seen if the new third-person view is only available in specific modes. PvE combat was also shown, confirming Firefight will be getting the third-person treatment. Count me in. 


Interestingly, the footage features one moment involving the player struggling to see while entering a Shroud Screen. This shows the drawback of adding third-person to a game not initially designed for it, so it'll be interesting to see how 343 Industries handles things like this in the full release.


Even if third-person mode doesn't become the de-facto way to play Halo Infinite going forward, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to try it out. It's currently set for a November release, with no specific date nailed down at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like every MMO, playing with your friends is a key aspect of enjoying Throne and Liberty's gameplay.


Of course, you can play with strangers and make new mates online, but the game also lets you play together with your friends (as long as the two of you are on the same server). In terms of available activities, there's plenty of freedom over what you want to do together. Unfortunately, your inventory can't be shared with your friend, and NCSoft's latest adventure is very strict about this.


Throne and Liberty trading with friends explained


When you participate in a quest with your friend, any rewards will be split equally. In fact, Throne and Liberty does have a player-driven economy where you can use your auctioning skills. But when it comes to trading between your friends, that's simply not possible.


The situation could change in the future if the developers decide to tweak how the existing system works. However, I hardly see that happening as NCSoft has already introduced the Auction House.




How does Auction House work in Throne and Liberty?


The Auction House allows you to trade your items and gears. To do that, you'll need a particular currency called the Lucent (this currency can be earned by simply playing the game). If you're looking for a specific piece of gear, you'll find it in the Auction House. Similarly, you can sell a gear that you don't need and earn Lucent in the process.


Please note that the Auction House is a work in progress as of this writing, and some major changes could be made to the system in the future. A direct trading system, on the other hand, could lead to unfair practices like botting. Moreover, it could also incentivize people to hoard their loot and ask for unexpected prices. All things considered, the presence of a universal Auction House is certainly a better trade-off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halloween has begun, but in order to actually start the event, you'll have to put in some effort first. Check out where to find the Halloween NPC in Type Soul and do some ghostbusting.


How to find the Halloween NPC in Type Soul - Location


In order to find the Halloween NPC called the Mystery Witch in the Type Soul Halloween update, you have to go to Karakura Town. If you're not already there, just use your Senkaimon to spawn in the town. The goal is to go down, but the easiest way I orient myself (since I will get lost in one room, let alone a map as large as this one) is by heading to the Trader first. 


The Trader is located on the balcony right across from Binders Bakery. There is a large tree and a pumpkin in this area so you can't miss it. Once you are there, jump over the fence next to the pumpkin and keep going diagonally to the left until you reach the edge. Now, go along the fence until you find an opening, then keep heading to the right.

When you are down to the lowest level, look for the purple sign with a bottle and numbers on it. The NPC is hiding in this alley right in the corner. Getting to the Mystery Witch is quite a hassle since you have to climb so far down, but it's worth it for the ability to fight off the ghosts.

Interact with the Mystery Witch Halloween NPC to start the Halloween event. You'll have to defeat ghosts in: 



Hueco Mundo


Soul Society 


Wanden


Karakura



When interacting with the Mystery Witch, you can also open the Halloween shop with plenty of items which you can purchase for points that you get from completing the quest. 


That's all there is to starting the Halloween event in Type Soul. If you are looking for more information, you can check out the Type Soul section here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the new Bleach-inspired Roblox game Paradox, you choose from three different Races each with their own different progression paths and evolutions. As you progress through various evolutions, others get locked out, making it important that you pre-plan and pick the right race. We've put together this Paradox Race Tier List so you know right from character creation what to work towards.

Paradox Race Tier List for all Unlocks and Evolutions (Launch Version)


All three races in Paradox have unique evolution paths, with ultimate pinnacle evolutions. Keep in mind, you cannot change your race once selected. These are typically the strongest options in Paradox (and are therefore in S Tier). Those in the A Tier are solid options to go into if you don't want to put in the grind for the S Tier evolutions. Those in the B Tier are typically the base versions of each Race, while those in the C Tier are reserved for the two side evolutions for Hollow. You won't stay as these evolutions for long, as they are very weak, but are intended as a challenge before evolving into the next variation. Here is our Paradox Race Tier List for every form of evolution and unlock for all of the Races at the time of launch:


S Tier



Ressurection Arrancar (Hollow Evolution)


Schrift Quincy (Quincy Unlock)


Vizard (Shinigami Unlock)



A Tier



Arrancar (Hollow Evolution)


Shikai (Shinigami Unlock)


Quincy (Base Quincy)



B Tier



Adjuchas (Hollow Evolution)


Soul Reaper (Base Shinigami)


Vasto Lorde (Hollow Evolution)



C Tier



Fishbone (Hollow Evolution)


Menos (Hollow Evolution)



As you can see, Soul Reaper, Hollow, and Quincy all have an unlock or evolution that makes them S Tier. In Paradox, you can typically choose which of the three races' playstyle caters to you the most, then focus on their S tier unlock or evolution as you progress through the game while getting strong along the way.

Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like Outer Wilds, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good. Lord.
Over the last year or so, we've been reporting on a new OLED screen mod for the Nintendo Switch Lite from modder Taki Udon. After months of arduous work, Udon's company Retro Remake is finally at a point where it can offer up OLED kits to customers who wish to upgrade their own Lite consoles for a better screen experience.

Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times.

I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We pitch our tents outside Constantinople and crack open the ale. In the light of the campfire I examine my travel companions as they party. There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite just releasing yesterday, Amazon and NCSOFT’s massively mate-filled RPG Throne And Liberty has already shot right up Steam’s most played charts. It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the trailer for steampunk RPG New Arc Line released in April, I was immediately taken in by its premise. To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a horror game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ Becrowned. In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time strategy game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I must confess, it was not till this very hour that I envisaged the possibility of an RPG party consisting exclusively of clowns. There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

So I tried out the demo for its sequel, System Purge: Hollow Point, and can confirm that the witch still has a nice hop. I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might remember Kara Stone as the developer of Ritual Of The Moon, a game about a banished witch that is played in bursts of five minutes a day, over the course of a lunar cycle. Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wartorn sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter has had a messy launch into early access. For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. 
The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.

Horace got burnt by a dodgy coffee maker once, had to regrow a few limbs, it’s a whole thing, the bear doesn’t like talking about it, etc. Anyway, rules are like Horace’s arms: they’re meant to be stretched, and also made of bear. MÖRK BORG Heresy Supreme is a grotty cheese dream of a 2D action game based on the popular tabletop RPG MÖRK BORG - a book so nice to just have on your shelf that I’m not even mad I accidentally bought a copy in Swedish.

Now here's Moon Watch, a Vampire Survivors-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

This rare roguelike distils the genre down to its purest components, all in favour of amplifying its dizzying combat that plays gracefully with the concepts of positioning and patience. Highly refined, stylish and complex, Shogun Showdown is a delight.

It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing a new Soulslike, there’s an element of translation involved while you figure out the language of the game. What are the upgrade materials called? What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

"It isn't fun anymore," she says in a video. "I'm tired of it. I'm bored with it, bored to death with it. So I am making the decision now - totally, finally - I am not going to be making any more gaming videos and uploading them."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
