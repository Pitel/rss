        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["If we’re going to make a change that sweeping, the original needs to be there as well".
The world of physical media in brick-and-mortar stores has dwindled in recent years due to the proliferation of digital storefronts readily and conveniently available on modern platforms. While some would never think to pay the same (or more) on a digital game versus one they can hold with their hands, plenty of folk are just fine with buying a game and installing it on their SD card without having to leave the house.
However, the success of boutique labels and companies like Limited Run Games has proven that tangible video games still have a place in the world, especially since a digital game store like the Wii Shop Channel, or more recently the 3DS and Wii U eShops, can be closed forever — in turn making digitally exclusive games inaccessible.

Ahoy everyone, welcome back to another Box Art Brawl! We've got a great one for you this week, just in case the image and the title didn't quite give it away.
Last week, we looked at Mario Golf (which is out now on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass!), pitting North America against Japan to determine which box art design is better. The more 'classic' design of the North American box art came out on top, taking in 67% of the vote. It seems the more 'artsy' approach for the Japanese version didn't quite resonate with readers, and we totally get it!

At the end of last month, Nintendo announced it would be delaying the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2.
While there are still plenty of Switch games to look forward to this year, there's obviously no longer a Zelda game coming out later this year. There have already been requests for Nintendo to port Wind Waker and Twilight Princess to the Switch, so how about that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["That’s the beauty of video games, it’s our way of life".

While there are often discussions around the merits of gaming as an artform, we perhaps talk less about examples of games helping to inspire other contemporary art. Yet as years pass it's an inevitability, as the role of games in the lives of millions has transformed since the mid- to late-'90s. We're gradually seeing more creative work and art outside of gaming with those tell-tale signs, those nods and echoes that gamers of all ages and types can instinctively understand and appreciate.

While it was due to arrive some time ago, it seems the developer has had some setbacks. It's now released a development update, and the good news is the game is still on the way to Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms.

This week on Game Informer was an exciting one, as we announced our grooviest issue so far featuring Evil Dead: The Game on the cover, we exclusively previewed a new Magic card, ranked the top 10 Lego games, and our very own Jason Guisao reviewed the wonderful new adventure game, Norco. Next week is looking to be just as exciting, if not more. But before we get to next week, we have an entire weekend to enjoy! Here's how the Game Informer staff is looking to spend the next couple of days:

Like every NBA team, Visual Concepts must get ready for another season and try to improve its roster and make the lineup stronger. Last year's entry was all about making the jump to new-gen hardware and truly taking advantage of the tech with impressive graphics and lightning-fast load times. You could say the developer found its core players when it made that move, but as with every roster, there's always room to grow into a title contender. Visual Concepts hasn't found its championship year, but it mad…]]></summary>

Remember when it seemed like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game would be forever lost to time, a victim of licensing issues. But we finally got it last year — and, like a bob-omb, absolutely blew us away. Limited Run Games released a physical edition of the game not long after it came out, and it was their most successful physical release of all time. Which meant, obviously, many people missed out on this gorgeous collector's edition.
So, we finally got our hands on one of these. To commemorate this stupendous occasion, the lovely Zion has put together a video where he unboxes this, along with a bunch of other goodies that he's picked up recently during his travels. It's a nice little follow-up to his last video, where he goes over a bunch of new additions to his collection.

Last week on the Halo series, we saw Master Chief and Kwan headed off to their respective homes to seek some sort of resolution to both their problems. But were our heroes victorious in their respective paths? Join us on The Game Informer Show as we review "Homecoming," the fourth episode in the Paramount Plus show, and let you know if it continues to build on the success of the previous episode.

Bethesda has launched a Switch eShop sale of all its titles, with discounts of 50% being the minimum while Doom Eternal (and its Deluxe Edition, which includes both DLC packs) both get a chunky 67% sliced off their full price.
In real money, that brings the base game down to $19.79 and the Deluxe Edition to $29.69. Elsewhere, Quake is down to $3.99 — not bad for a Nintendo Life 10/10! — and Dooms 1, 2 and 64 are all just $2.49. The first two games there got another free update just the other day, too. After a rocky launch they've both been patched to become really fantastic ports that are definitely worth checking out.

Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the 'massive expansion' heading to the Switch / PC title on 30th June, will no doubt seek to emulate the success of the Iceborne expansion that was previously released for Monster Hunter: World on PlayStation 4 / Xbox One / PC. An information blowout in mid-March set the scene for what will hopefully be an exciting addition.
Capcom is continuing its consistent promotion of the expansion, and most recently has shared extended looks at key areas. At the top of the page is a tour of the Citadel that can be found in the new land, which will be a key location for tackling new Master Rank quests. It has some intriguing medieval / Dark Souls vibes.

Travis Touchdown's most recent adventure from the minds of Suda 51 and Grasshopper Manufacture, No More Heroes 3 has been a Switch exclusive since it was released. But as of today, that all changes because Xseed has announced it's bringing NMH3 to more platforms this fall.
No More Heroes 3 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, according to a tweet from Xseed Games. An image embedded with the announcement shows off what looks to be collector's editions for the console versions. Included with these expanded editions are a CD labeled "musical selections" from No More Heroes 3, a Santa Destroy "MOE~" vanity license plate, and an art book.

I had the honor of reviewing No More Heroes 3's Switch release, and while I loved the combat and a lot of the humor, the performance, resolution, and overall drabness of the open world brought the experience down. Here's hoping that the game can benefit greatly when transitioning to more powerful hardware and maybe even throwing in some extras knobs to turn for the PC crowd. I gave No More Heroes 3 a 7.75 out of 10 on the Game Informer scale. Here's an excerpt to get a taste of what's in store if you dive into NMH3:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devilishly good platforming.
When Demon Turf launched at the tail end of 2021, it left a positive impression on us thanks to its solid platforming gameplay, retro aesthetic, and focus on speedrunning. The game fell short of true greatness due to its less-than-stellar combat mechanics, which frankly brought the whole experience down a few pegs. In a lovely surprise, publisher PlayTonic Friends has shadow-dropped a spin-off called Demon Turf: Neon Splash; think of it like stand-alone DLC, if you will!
Unlike the main game, Demon Turf: Neon Splash doesn’t feature any kind of hub area (though it does feature an optional “Playground” for you to hang out in and practice your moves). It’s far more content simply guiding the player through a series of linear levels, each more tricky than the last; make no mistake, some of the later levels can be fiendishly difficult. There are 10 normal levels in total, with an additional 10 remix levels that are even more brutal in their design.

To say Reggie has inspired thousands is an understatement. He invigorated Nintendo and brought many new eyes and faces into gaming, as new fans picked up controllers or developers, publishers, QA testers, etc. joined the industry because of his work. Many of us wouldn't love Nintendo games as much as we do without his enthusiasm. He's also got a pretty darn good legacy of memes behind him, and we've been wondering whether the book will cover any of these.

Indie publishers DreadXP have become so synonymous with tightly curated, intriguing horror experiences that it's hard to believe the original demo anthology that kickstarted that reputation is only approaching its second anniversary.
Regular RPS readers may already be aware that (a) I'm a huge horror nerd, and (b) I think the games published under the DreadXP banner are something pretty special. I was equal parts grossed out and charmed by the Lovecraftian dating sim Sucker For Love: First Date when I reviewed it back in January, and was pleasantly surprised by my time with the My Friendly Neighborhood demo at the recent Steam Next Fest. So when I was offered the opportunity to interview Ted Hentschke, Head of Productions at DreadXP, as part of a digital event at last month's GDC, you can hardly blame me for jumping at the chance.

The Legend of Zelda franchise has seen its fair share of adaptations over the years. One of the most recognisable (and one of few that is still in print to this day) is the manga adaptation of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
In lesser-known circles, the game also happened to receive a novelisation in Japan by author Katsuyuki Ozaki. It was part of the Futabasha Fantasy Novel Series and took some liberties with some of the franchise's more well known aspects. You can check out the full novel over on Internet Archive, but keep in mind that the majority of the book is in Japanese text.

A Cyberpunk 2077 expansion is in the works and will be in development this year, but it won't see the bright lights of Night City until it releases in 2023, as was announced on the CDPR Twitter account and in this same earnings call. Also, the Witcher series is getting a new entry and a new engine in Unreal 5, and the studio will continue to work on improving Cyberpunk – no surprises there. CDP…]]></summary>

You might think that simply murdering customers who annoyed you would make it a lot easier, but Bone's Cafe has taught me that if anything, killing and cooking people just causes more problems.


Fun problems, though.

It's Easter, and we here at Nintendo Life think that "Easter Egg" features are more overdone than an egg boiled for 20 minutes. Besides, we know about all the Easter Eggs in games already, from Chris Houlihan's room to the secret Tingle dungeon that you can find in Skyward Sword by entering the Konami code. (That last one's not real. Right?)
But Easter is all about eggs (among other things), so why not celebrate our yolky friends with a list of the very best eggies in video games? This weekend, when you're chomping down on a hollow facsimile of a chicken oval, think of all the excellent eggs there have been across the years. Isn't that the true meaning of Easter, after all?

Halo Infinite’s second season, Lone Wolves, is slated to begin on May 3 and brings a host of new content to the game. 343 Industries released a blog post detailing one of its most exciting additions in the form of two new maps: Catalyst and Breaker.
Catalyst is a sleek, though abandoned, Forerunner base that’s been reclaimed by nature. Expect plenty of foliage to cover its monolithic surfaces, and 343 describes Catalyst as a vertical symmetrical arena featuring suspended catwalks and a light bridge connecting the map’s two halves. 
Breaker is a Banished shipyard laden with debris situated on a dusty desert planet. Its centerpiece element is a giant plasma cutting beam moving across the map that players can battle around at their own peril or benefit. 343 describes Breaker as a “pseudo symmetric BTB” map. Catalyst and Breaker will support all of the existing multiplayer modes as well as the new ones coming next season. You can watch a video fly-by of both arenas in the video below.

Be sure to read 343's blog post for the developer's complete breakdown of these maps' inspirations and design elements. Lone Wolves will also introduce new story elements, modes, and cosmetics – 343 plans to spill the beans on those additions in the coming weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks a bit meaty.
Quite a lot of video games are violent, as we aim for headshots or pummel thugs, though Ravenous Devils still finds a way to push buttons in a different way. It's a game that describes itself as a 'psycho-horror cooking simulator', and makes sure you really deal with the violence on offer.
Playing out like a grisly horror movie concept, you run a pub and tailor business in 19th Century London, and due to spiralling meat and resource prices you obtain materials through other means. The game seems to play out as real-time resource management / strategy, and is undoubtedly rather gnarly (definitely an 18+).

If you like yourself some Star Trek — and what intelligent, attractive person doesn't? — there's certainly plenty of it around at the moment. New series, new films, new games; it's a bountiful time for fans of the final frontier. Star Trek: Picard is currently deep into its second season, with the full main cast of The Next Generation confirmed to be returning in Season 3, and the upcoming Star Trek: Strange New Worlds seems to be offering a return to the episodic planet-of-the-week-style format that fans of 'Legacy' Trek have been jonesing for.
However, we recently stumbled across the beginnings of a fan project that loaded our torpedo bays with more nostalgia than that, even. Behold a bold meeting of two of our very favourite things in the universe: Star Trek: TNG and Zelda: Majora's Mask.

Since benchmarking the AMD EPYC 7773X with its hefty 1.5GB of L3 cache for 2P servers via AMD 3D V-Cache, I've been curious to try this forthcoming kernel on that Milan-X configuration.

You ride this bus long enough, you see games move in cycles similar to fashion designers, or those big ferris wheels at fairgrounds. Things come round, they peak, they go round again. Often a few different people independently notice an empty niche and start working on something to fill it, so you get a bunch of games with similar themes or styles coming out within months of each other. So I ask: why and/or how have a bunch of people identified golf as a gap in the market?

CD Projekt Red has released its 2021 Fiscal Year earnings, revealing new sales numbers for both its Witcher franchise and its latest game, Cyberpunk 2077.

In fact, as of today, The Witcher series has sold more than 65 million copies, with more than 40 million of them being The Witcher III: Wild Hunt alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh sure, Dark Souls is a challenging game at the start, but at least your characters begin with enough stats to wear their starter outfit. That's not necessarily the case with the official licensed Dark Souls pen & paper RPG, which seems a touch sloppy. Along with giving one class starter gear it won't have the stats use, it has some spells and items which, going by the rules, seem unhelpful at best. The real Dark Souls starts here.

Lost Ark has a handful of subclasses that didn't make it over from the Korean version game to the Amazon Games' localized edition that was released in February. Thanks to a tweet from the Lost Ark team, we may be able to play one of those subclasses in the game very soon.

The tweet, which you can see above, only contains a GIF of a rotating bladed polearm that indicates and a date emblazoned below it of April 21 indicates the Gaivalier is set to arrive in an update next week. Also known as the Lance Master in the Korean Lost Ark, the Glaivier is a Martial Artist subclass that specializes in using spears and glaives, poking enemies with dangerous sharp objects from a safe distance. She can use her special class ability to switch between stances while fighting.
The Glaivier already has a page on the official Lost Ark site that gives a brief description of its playstyle and shows shows off some of the skills you'll be utilizing on the battlefield. Here's Lost Ark's description of the new subclass:
"The Glaivier has two distinct skill sets, each one is represented by one of her weapons, the spear and the glaive. The best way to leverage her eloquent, yet deadly form of martial arts is to find balance between her two stances."
If the April 21 date is truly the release of the Glaivier, we'll be swinging big deadly polearms in all kinds of badass ways in a week's time. If you're new to Lost Ark, its an isometric online action/RPG that you can download and play for free on Steam. I gave the game an 8.25 out of 10 in my review which you can read here. If you're a fan of games like Diablo, or want to try an MMO that's easy to get into, Lost Ark is a great game to check out.]]></summary>

After posting a deal that had the Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti at its UK RRP of £1049 last week, third-party cards are now reaching the same levels. Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. 
If you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months.

South of the Circle is a narrative adventure centered on survival and romance in the midst of the Cold War that first launched in Apple Arcade in 2020. The game comes from Lumino City developer State of Play and is now being published by 11 Bit Studios, the team behind Frostpunk and This War of Mine. 
Unfolding during the politically charged 1960s, players control a climate scientist named Peter. As a Cambridge academic, he finds himself conflicted with the brewing global conflict, which drives a wedge between himself and his love, Clara. Peter’s troubles escalate during a trip when he crash-lands in Antarctica. Stranded, he must now survive the frigid landscape while reflecting on the personal and professional choices that took him to this point.

State of Play says South of the Circle is inspired by narrative adventure games such as Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch and boasts a striking cinematic, minimalist art direction. It's unclear how gameplay unfolds, but the implication is that interactions will be on the minimal side of things. The game is brought to life by an ensemble cast including Gwilym Lee (Bohemian Rhapsody), Olivia Vinall (The Woman in White), Richard Goulding (The Crown), Anton Lesser (Game of Thrones), Adrian Rawlins (Chernobyl), and Michael Fox (Downton Abbey).
South of the Circle is planned to launch later this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

I’m a real sucker for verticality, so normally I’d be immediately trying to see how high I could get, but after tentatively scaling a few floors I decided to give the urgent main quest the benefit of the doubt. There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. 
I’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets.

Road 96 touts a procedurally-generated narrative about several teens crossing the border of the nation of Petria. Of course, we’ve seen our fair share of procedurally-generated levels in roguelikes. Still, the promise of a shifting, randomized story made Road 96 an ambitious experiment to watch when it dropped for Switch last year. And even though it might feel as if Road 96 flew under the radar, it was listed as one of the Switch’s best-selling indies in 2021! Today, DigixArt’s third title cruises onto PlayStation and Xbox. 
You can watch the Xbox launch trailer below:

The trailer showcases Road 96’s vibrant, cartoony aesthetic, but don’t mistake that for narrative lightheartedness. Political and personal tension lies at the heart of the adventure game’s dynamic storylines. While interacting with several NPCs (friendly or otherwise) and selecting choices that influence various outcomes, you’ll be exploring a wilderness hosting desert expanses, lush forests, and more. This all comes packaged in a 4K 60fps experience. As the trailer’s narrator states, “each decision could shape your destiny and Petria’s too. Time for you to hit the road.”

While it makes sense in theory, in practice with Linux 5.16 having been out as stable since January and Linux 5.17 out for several weeks already there is a lot of hardware improvements past the v5.15 that haven't been back-ported or otherwise picked up by Ubuntu Jammy's kernel build. The main pain point this presents is for those using the latest-generation Intel "Alder Lake" processors with a mix of performance and power efficiency cores. My testing of Alder Lake this week on the latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS build still shows that its 5.15-based experience being less than desirable with measurable -- often very significant -- improvements if using v5.16 or later.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FixFox came out a couple of weeks back, and I am in the process of reviewing it. This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.
I was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Niantic Labs is no stranger to cute creatures featured in AR mobile games; it popularized the genre with games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom. But now, Niantic is betting on its own IP with the new AR experience called Peridot. 
The game is named after the critters at the center of the game. Peridots, or Dots as Niantic also calls them, are to be raised from birth to adulthood and can be bred to create new variations of Peridots. Because it's an AR game like Pokémon Go, you'll be able to travel with your Dots, who will help you find items in the world or can be used for a photo-op at a local landmark.

Lifting some features from the Tamogachi or Nintendogs crazes (or, you know, real pets), you'll be spending time with your Dots by teaching them tricks, feeding them, and, yes, you can pet the Peridots. When breeding the Dots, you can mix and match them with your friends' creatures with different characteristics to create entirely new creature archetypes and combinations to diversify the species further.

Niantic is looking to soft-launch Peridot in select territories and countries soon, although no exact locations or release dates have been specified yet. You can pre-register for Peridot on the game's website to get updates on when it'll be available. Expect the game to launch on iOS and Android devices when it becomes available.
Are you excited for this breeding twist on the creature collection genre? Let us know if you're going to be playing Peridot in the comments below!]]></summary>

Wait... Is it Steven Grant or Marc Spector? On third thought, is it Marc Spector or someone else? Regardless of who is in control at the moment, Moon Knight punishes evildoers and looks darn good doing it.
You will soon be able to add Steven and Marc's versions of this character to your Funko Pop and Marvel Legends action figure collections. Funko recently announced a handful of Pops based on this new show. The line consists of Moon Knight in his traditional garb (as Marc sees it), Moon Knight in a nice suit (as Steven sees it), and a comic book version of him that comes with a comic cover background. The wave also includes a Pop of Arthur Harrow, who may or may not be evil. Time will tell. You can see all of the Pops in the gallery below.

Hasbro is releasing two different Legends Moon Knight action figures, again showing off Marc and Steven's ideas of the character on the show. Both figures come with the appropriate weapons, along with a build-a-figure component.

In Evil Dead: The Game, if you’re looking to play as the Demon, you have your work cut out for you. Taking on four players by yourself can be quite a task, but you have a plethora of wicked tools at your disposal. With traps, Deadites, and even possessing survivors, you can attempt to isolate and destroy your targets with precision. Each different Demon comes with a special kit that syncs up with various playstyles, so let’s take a look at the three core Demon templates you’ll have available to play with at launch. …]]></summary>

That's £20 cheaper than the current Amazon price, and a massive drop from the £430+ going rate at the beginning of the year.
*OK, the Ryzen 9 5950X is technically faster, but it costs way more and the difference in gaming performance is miniscule. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D also looks promising, but hasn't yet been released and will likely cost more than this 5900X while packing fewer cores.

CD Projekt Red has announced it will be delaying the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as it brings the remainder of the porting in-house.
We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice. 1/2
April 13, 2022
The change in development teams on the new-generation upgrades was revealed through a tweet on The Witcher series Twitter account. "We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," reads the tweet. "We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice." A follow-up message says, "We'll update you as soon as we can. Thank you for your understanding."
Saber Interactive was the company working on the ports of Witcher 3 to the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft and had previously partnered with CD Projekt on the Switch port of the same game. No reason was given as to why Saber will no longer be involved, nor is there a timeline on the new expected release window. 
In recent months, CD Projekt has had its hands full with the new-gen ports of Cyberpunk 2077 released in February and is still planning to expand the game with new content. The studio also announced a new chapter in The Witcher franchise is coming and will be running on Unreal Engine 5 instead of the in-house developed REDengine.]]></summary>

MLB The Show 22 is a savvy veteran, a game that continues to perform well on the field, despite some modes feeling like they are falling behind the times. Developer Sony San Diego once again finds new ways to capture the realism of the sport and add even more excitement to the already fantastic batting and pitching battle. Given just how much content is here, not every mode received the attention we want, but Sony makes up for them with excellent new experiences.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Blizzard has released a new video shedding light on the origin story of Overwatch 2's new hero, Sojourn. 
A trailer sheds light on Sojourn's background as a former Canadian special forces captain who worked alongside Overwatch during its peak. We still don't know much about her combat abilities beyond the fact that she's a damage-focused hero, but players will find out when Sojourn becomes playable in the game's upcoming PvP beta for PC. 
Click here to watch embedded media
Speaking of that beta, it's set to go live sometime this month after Blizzard announced it was detaching PvP modes from PvE to get the former content out the door faster. Overwatch 2 still doesn't have a release window, and its development has been affected by factors such as Activision Blizzard's ongoing sexual harassment lawsuits, staff departures, and the publisher's impending acquisition by Microsoft.

Game publisher Aspyr has announced that it will be acquiring development studio Beamdog. The news was revealed in a tweet this morning, one day after the two companies announced a new game together, MythForce.
We're excited to welcome the talented team at @BeamdogInc to the Aspyr family!

The tweet reads, "We're excited to welcome the talented team at Beamdog to the Aspyr family!" Other than giving a link to the MythForce website, no other information on the purchase is given. 
Outside of the new IP that is MythForce, Beamdog has specialized in remastering classic Dungeons and Dragons-related RPGs. The studio has previously released Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, Beamdog developed an online edition of the strategy board game Axis and Allies 1942.
Aspyr also has its hands in remastering and releasing games. The developer/publisher has been bringing back Star Wars games from the recently bygone eras, such as Star Wars: Episode I – Racer, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and the upcoming port of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Switch. While most of these games are straightforward ports, Aspyr is developing a from-the-ground-up remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which was announced at The Game Awards last year.
MythForce, the project tying these studios together before the acquisition, is a four-player first-person fantasy roguelite with art designed to resemble a Saturday morning cartoon. Check out the trailer for it in our story from its announcement yesterday. Mythforce enters Early Access exclusively on the Epic Games Store on April 20.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on in-person events for a couple of years now. Although infection numbers have generally fallen in recent months, many companies continue to exercise caution when it comes to organizing public gatherings and Quakecon is one of them. The show's organizers have announced that for the third year in a row, Quakecon 2022 will be a digital-only event.
In a post to Twitter, the organizers revealed that Quakecon will take place August 18-20 with more details to come in June. They explain that the constant uncertainty around holding large gatherings this year made it hard to commit to putting a show together in the time required. Quakecon will return to its normal in-person state in 2023, however. You can read the full statement below:
Quakecon was a digital event in 2020 and 2021, with last year’s show being free to attend. This news isn't far removed from E3 2022's outright cancellation last month due to similar concerns, though this month's PAX East has committed to being a physical convention. Every company has their own comfort-level for dealing with the pandemic and while the situation has improved, we likely won't see every event back in full from until at least 2023 and maybe beyond.]]></summary>

In Evil Dead, playing as a survivor means you’re going to be taking on a ton of Deadites, regardless of what your favorite specializations or weapons are. While survivors are placed into basic buckets that dictate areas that they’re better at, you’re inevitably going to be doing plenty of shooting, stabbing, and decapitating as you move through a level. So don’t think that by playing support you’re going to be sitting in the back throwing heals and watching fear meters – every class is going to be in the thick of it…]]></summary>

For the Noctua NH-U9 series and other 4U compatible heatsinks they've tended to be limited to 80~92mm cooling fans due to height requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even with PC hardware orthodoxy supporting SSD replacement, I’m convinced that getting one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck is the wiser method of expanding its storage. It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.


That’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well.

        PlayStation 4
				
Publisher:
      Sony Interactive Entertainment
			
Developer:
      Sucker Punch Productions
      
Release:
                      	July 17, 2020
			
            
The upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film will have its screenplay written by Takashi Doscher, Deadline reports. 
Doscher’s writing credits include writing and directing 2019’s sci-fi romance Only, the Hulu exclusive film Still, and the ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance. Now he’ll be penning the screenplay for Ghost of Tsushima’s big-screen adaptation, which is helmed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Alex Young and Jason Spitz of 87Eleven Entertainment serve as producers with PlayStation Productions overseeing the entire project. 
The Ghost of Tsushima film is in very early development, with Stahlski saying in December that he intends to take his time with the movie in order to “do it right.” The film crew is said to be working closely with the game’s developer, Sucker Punch. Stahlski is a fan of Ghost and was inspired to make the movie after playing the game “many times.”
We still don’t know anything in regards to casting (though the voice actor for protagonist Jin Sakai raised his hand in humorous fashion) and it will likely be a while before we see anything substantial from the project. But it’s nice to see the pieces slowly fall into place. Video game movies have generally improved over the last few years, so we hope that Ghost of Tsushima continues the trend when it is eventually released.

Point-and-click games cemented the vast potential of interactive narrative at the turn of the century, employing innovative environmental/dialogue puzzles with evocative pixel art and chiptune music. Nowadays, we lose ourselves in impossibly large sandboxes with equally extensive choice-driven plotlines. It’s fitting, then, that Norco feels like a precious relic from the Sierra-led Golden Age of digital adventures. Geography of Robots’ debut title ponders unchecked capitalism and classism at the heart of America’s oft-neglected Deep South. Moreover, Norco’s retrofuturistic and net.art aesthetic is …]]></summary>

Hell is Us represents a big step for Montréal-based studio Rogue Factor and creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. It’s the developer’s first original IP after releasing Mordheim: City of the Damned and Necromunda: Underhive Wars, stepping out from the massive Warhammer license, creating something the team can call its own. Jacques-Belletête departed Eidos Montréal after spending just short of 12 years with the company, where he found success as the art director on Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided and had just completed the art direction design for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy before leaving.

As the Demon in Evil Dead: The Game, you have a lot of work to do – after all, you have to beat 4 other players! However, you have a rather nasty toolbox at your command, full of traps, possessions, and even the ability to summon horrific boss monsters that will destroy your prey. Of course, the first challenge is simply to find them, a task that can be daunting given how big the map is. Survivors can do things that give away their position too like riding in cars, so it’s important to pay close attention to the minimap.

Want to see how everything works in Evil Dead: The Game? As a survivor, you’ll have to loot up and complete objectives before taking the battle to The Dark Ones themselves. To do this, you have to gear up and take advantage of numerous caches of loot scattered across the vast map.

You might even want to use a car to help get around the field much fast, but be aware that the Demon can possess cars too, turning them into deadly weapons in a flash. Be on the lookout for signs like traps that the Demon might be close to discovering your presence – even though the map is huge, they can find you early! Check out some exclusive gameplay and commentary in this video focused on the survivor perspective!]]></summary>

It features words and handheld-centric essays from writers in and around the gaming industry like Jason Bradbury, Janet Garcia (Lost In Cult, Pen To Pixels), Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat), Mike Diver (GAMINGbible), and more. Plus, it contains tons of beautiful and original art throughout.
"Brought to you in partnership with Retro Dodo – the internet's leading retro gaming site – A Handheld History is an explorative jaunt through systems and games that defined the legacy of portable systems," the website for A Handheld History reads.

Made by a player, the level does a surprisingly good job of capturing a sense of Elden Ring-ness, stunting on your motorbike past the Erdtree and over a castle towards an all-too-familiar ending.

There's plenty of action RPG for fans of the genre, but Steelrising hopes to rise above the usual high octane fun. Join us for a special episode of New Gameplay Today as we give you a look at what to expect from developer Spiders' upcoming title.

To make this NGT even more exciting, the team behind Steelrising is here. Jehanne Rousseau (CEO, co-founder, and lead writer), Sébastien Di Ruzza (design director), and Ciaran Cresswell (localization lead) gave us the deets ahead of the game's September 8 release.
But what can players expect from the unique new title? Steelrising takes place during a fictionalized and sci-fi version of the French Revolution. You play as protagonist Aegis as they take on the treacherous automata army to liberate the people of France. Given such a unique mesh of period and theme, the developers got the unique chance of merging the beautiful styles of the past with a dark and unsettling layer of robotic terror to create a truly unique art style.
On top of its creative visuals, Steelrising will feel right at home for fans of action RPGs. The game features plenty of upgrades, weapons, and armor to collect and an exciting story set in this fascinating vision of a fictional past. Another big emphasis for the team was making sure that the routine enemy encounters/boss battles were memorable and enjoyable. Did they accomplish such a feat? You'll have to watch today's NGT to find out!
Are you excited for more from Steelrising? Spiders' new game launches later this year on September 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Today, Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games look to enter the emergent asymmetric horror market with Evil Dead: The Game, which operates in a decidedly different fashion than other options out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a years-long wait, Stranger Things’ penultimate fourth season kicks off this summer. Releasing in two parts, the season's first full-length trailer sets the table for dangers new and old the heroes of Hawkins must contend with. 
The story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”

Stranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. 
Earlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.]]></summary>

A new update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection is now live and it includes a number of bug fixes and improvements for the overall experience. Perhaps more exciting, though, is the addition of new Halo 3: ODST firefight variants such as Floodfight, which pits you against Flood enemies, and Halo 3 cross-platform co-op. 
Clocking in at roughly 22 gigabytes on Xbox consoles, this update is one of the biggest in recent memory for MCC, especially as much of 343 Industries continues its focus on the latest Halo game, Halo Infinite. Here’s what’s …]]></summary>

It keeps things simple and it largely works, making for a game that's an inoffensive 8-bit-style romp with flashes of greatness.

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more "kind of like an Ubisoft game" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.
I am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Corsair 7000D Airflow hasn't been reviewed here at RPS, but I've brought it up today for two reasons: because it's heavily discounted over at Amazon UK, and because it's a case I've been using to house my main PC for the past six months. I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.
The case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.


In a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.

I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.


While the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.

Kerbal Space Program 2 wants to up the ante somewhat by upping the scale and allowing for interstellar travel. 

A new 15-minute video from its developers talks about the challenges of simulating interstellar travel - from the engine changes required to support such vast scale, to the reasons for even wanting to.

It took almost 70 levels for Reiterate to do that. That's a recommendation.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they’re not immune to bonkers inflation, they’re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.


Which, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. 
Indeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia's RTX 3080 is the most powerful GPU recommended in our roundup of the best graphics cards, as it offers a ton more performance than the RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti - without the huge expense of the RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3090 or RTX 3090 Ti. Therefore, it's extremely exciting to see the RTX 3080 available at Laptops Direct for a recent low price of £860, some £100 below the cheapest RTX 3080 card on Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’d be forgiven for getting excited about the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT. A brand new RDNA 2 graphics card, with ray tracing support, that’s both easy to find in stock and available at a comparatively approachable £200 / $230? In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.


Alas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.

But Chinatown Detective Agency, a beautiful, pixely, point and click puzzle game set in a cyberpunk future Singapore, has what I predict will be a pretty polarising central feature, and that is real time historical research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever played 2019's My Time At Portia (and given that game's popularity, statistics suggest a bunch of you have) you'll know the appeal. It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. 
But now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack.

Well, yes and no. The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.
This means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.

That’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.
I'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.
