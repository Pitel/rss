        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive sneaks not included
PRIX, the artsy clothing company owned by influential NZ designer Esther NG, has produced a line of clothing replicating the super-iconic "Player 2" look sported by King in Tekken 3 — Quite understandably, the line sold out almost immediately, because why wouldn't it?
The famous fit — first sported by the mysterious grappler King II in Tekken's highly acclaimed second sequel — consists of a pair of blue/grey and leopard print track pants, and a matching blue/grey shirt, emblazoned with the declaration "Mishima Zaibatsu EVIL". King rounds off the look with a similarly colored variant of his Jaguar mask and a massive pair of white running shoes. Over the following years, the look has become something of a meme icon among the Tekken community.

Yesterday, PRIX launched replica designs of both the track pants and the shirt, both priced at $70. A form-fitting, long sleeve variant of the shirt was also available at $60. Of course, there was a wild rush on these fashion-forward items, resulting in a total sell-out of the pants, as well as most of the shirt inventory clearing out double-time. There is currently a waiting list available on site for those hoping to jump on any possible re-order.
In addition to the King gear, PRIX also released a line of T-shirts featuring renders of characters from Tekken 3. Again, these items are mostly long gone, with only Extra Small-to-Small sizes still available at the time of writing. You can check out the entire range over on the PRIX website.
Congratulations to the lucky buyers. I hope that you're practicing your standing moonsault as we speak.
Tekken 8 launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X later in 2023.

A first-person shooter where instead of killing your enemies you are giving them a stylish makeover is a brilliant idea on its own, but when you throw in the ability to swing around your environment — à la Spider-Man — from a designer belt, this becomes a concept like no other. Developed by the small team at Mopeful Games, Fashion Police Squad is bringing all of this to the Switch when it sashays its way onto the console on 2nd February.
This is a game that will see you take to the streets of Trendopolis and set out on a mission to solve the city's fashion crimes. There's excessively baggy trousers, poorly-fitting suits, vests and jeans — welcome to the early 2000s folks! Fashion Police Squad (or 'FPS', see what they did there?) is a non-violent take on the first-person shooter, because what if all that bad guys really needed was a new wardrobe?

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hole. For starters, each of the 30 launch courses was created with the help of the course superintendents, state-of-the-art technology (including helicopte…]]></summary>

Some good news for fans of Netflix' Sonic Prime series, as the team behind the colorful animated show has announced that further adventures featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and his dopey friends are currently in production — tentatively expected to air later in 2023.
Premiering just last month, Sonic Prime is a multi-part series that sees The Blue Blur thrust into a strange multiverse environment, where he encounters multiple versions of popular characters such as Tails, Knuckles, Rogue, Amy Rose, and a plethora — a council, even — of extra evil Dr. Robotniks. The first episode premiered on the Roblox platform on December 10, with the 10-episode saga debuting on Netflix proper on December 15.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1615767982214631425?s=20&t=WebPk-h3ZxgMeWVO_67AYg
No further details were announced regarding the new episodes. The tweet did not confirm whether this was classed as a "second season", nor whether the show will be returning to the Netflix streaming service. But we'll be sure to give you a heads-up when the talented animation squad behind the series has more information to offer.
The debut of Sonic Prime rounded off a pretty eventful year for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, with the past 12 months also seeing the release of remaster Sonic Origins, open-world adventure Sonic Frontiers, and the hugely successful cinematic sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In a statement made last month, Team Sonic president Takashi Iizuka opined that 2022 was "The biggest year in Sonic history."
Sonic Prime is available to watch now on Netflix.

Switch eShop - Highlights
Fire Emblem Engage (Nintendo, 20th Jan, $59.99) - Team up with iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem games and add their power to yours in this new Fire Emblem story! Legendary heroes called Emblems grant incredible power to the one who holds the 12 Emblem Rings. However, the Fell Dragon and ancient nemesis of the Divine Dragon has risen and seeks the rings for his own evil gain. Command the army of the Divine Dragon through turn-based battles across the continent and bring peace back to Elyos. Each battle is different, requiring its own strategy and approach. Plan attacks carefully when commanding each hero with their own moves and weapons while using the terrain, positioning and unique talents of the heroes to defeat the enemy across the grid-based battlefield. Tailor your experience with a range of difficulty and game modes suited for all skill levels. Casual Mode sees fallen allies revived after a battle, while they’ll be lost forever when using Classic Mode. If you make a major error in combat, use the Draconic Time Crystal to rewind and try again, in any mode! The Fire Emblem Engage game will be available on Jan. 20. - Read our Fire Emblem Engage review

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin's Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
"We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated," Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It's currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

We love playing video games. It can be a mode of escape, a time to relax, a story to get deep into, or something to stimulate the mind. But the fact of the matter is, we also hate playing video games. They can be really hard, we lose unfairly, a mechanic doesn't sit right, or we forget to save.
Of course, these frustrations are never permanent (isn't that what keeps us coming back, after all?), but this doesn't make them any less annoying. Sometimes we really need to complete a certain task to move on with the game and other times it is all about our own sanity: "I have to overcome this obstacle/defeat this boss/find this item before I can put it down."

But two years after Awaceb's trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

Ubisoft has confirmed that its online hero battler, tentatively known as "Project Q" is one of the three games that has had production halted in the wake of a financially unsuccessful year for the publisher.
In a statement made to Eurogamer this morning, an Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed that the Project Q development team was being reassigned to other endeavors/projects within the studio, effectively canceling any further progress on the PvP shooter, which was first announced in April 2022. The only public assets for Project Q to date consists of a single piece of splash art, alongside Ubisoft's insistence that the game was not a battle royale title, nor was it an NFT project.
https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517896643345108995?s=20&t=0HlH-rOUpJIzl2GDQbcOuw
Ubisoft announced last week that it was canceling three in-development titles, along with yet another delay for its pirate-based adventure Skull & Bones. These announcements were reportedly accompanied by an email to staff from Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, whose comments have seemingly formed the basis for a staff walkout, to be held at the Ubisoft Paris studio on January 27.
"On several occasions, Mr. Guillemot is trying to shift the blame (once again) onto the employees; he expects us to be mobilized, to ‘give it our all,’ to be ‘as efficient and lean as possible‘," wrote union Solidaires Informatique of the email. "These words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc. Mr. Guillemot asks a lot from his employees, but without any compensation."
"And because Mr. Guillemot and his clique only understand the relationship of power, Solidaires Informatique is calling on the employees of Ubisoft Paris to go on strike."

We always want more games to feature watercolour-esque or hand-drawn visuals, and Helvetii — an upcoming action game from Team KwaKwa (developers of Soup Raiders) — looks like it's going to give us our fix. And we won't have to wait long, as the game hits the Switch eShop on 3rd February!
Inspired by Vanillaware's stunning art style (we're definitely getting some Muramasa vibes from this), Helvetii is a 2D action roguelite that's based on the Gaulish Helvetii tribes. In Celtic history, the Helvetii were people who were driven from southern Germany to the north — an area that we now know as Switzerland (via Britannica).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft's layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft's ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company's portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in "strategic, competitive areas" like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

As reported by Kotaku, Guillemot took part in a company-wide Q&A session with Ubisoft staff and opened the meeting by apologising for his previous comment, stating “I heard your feedback and I’m sorry this was perceived that way". The apology was alleged in response to an up-voted question which read “the ball is now in our court—for years it has been in your court so why did you mishandle the ball so badly so we, the workers, have to fix it for you?”.

The biggest one that caught our eye is that we can now access DIP switches from the Game Options menu for most arcade games. Also, Atari Jaguar's Tempest 2000 will now be playable at 60 fps!

Sources claim that some of the staff who’d lost their jobs at the affected studios were veterans who’d been with Microsoft for more than a decade.

It has been 12 long years since we last heard the infamous instructions of "Lucky, Daisy, Baxter" while we sat in a completely sound-proofed room attempting to teach our dog its name in the 3DS' Nintendogs + Cats. Of course, this followed the six-year wait after the release of the original Nintendogs on the DS — a watershed moment where a huge number of us spent each day walking, cleaning and playing with the virtual pups. And now, it looks like there might be more dog content from Nintendo to come.
A recent patent, dated 17th January 2023 and originally filed for in November 2021, seems to suggest that Nintendo is working on a new way to bring the world of virtual dogs back into our homes (thanks, My Nintendo News). This time around, the technology all seems to be about augmented reality and the ability to place a virtual object (a dog, in the example given) into a real-world environment as captured through a camera.

Sting, the developer behind the Dept. Heaven games such as Riviera: The Promised Land, Yggdra Union, and Knights in the Nightmare, is bringing back Dokapon Kingdom for the Switch. This news came from an early Famitsu scoop yesterday from @gamenohanshi (via @gosokkyu), with Famitsu confirming the news later.
Released on the PS2 in 2007 before coming to the Wii in 2008, this board game RPG will be launching on Switch in Japan as Dokapon Kingdom: Connect on 13th April 2023. Sadly, a Western release date has yet to be announced — but we're hoping! (Even though we've also been praying for that Knights in the Nightmare rerelease to make its way here...)

If you can't get enough of some creepy clowns, you're in for a treat — a new trailer for the Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game just dropped, and it's got all the spooky, grotesque weirdness we've come to love and expect from such an IP. The 50-second teaser doesn't give much of anything in terms of gameplay footage, but it does introduce us to the cast of Killer Klowns in the game's lineup (hence why it's titled "Meet the Klowns"). This trailer gets us up close and personal so we can get a better look at the Klowns' character models, as well as their weapons — one of which is the iconic popcorn gun from the 1988 film.

Microsoft confirmed earlier today that it will be laying off 10,000 employees. Reports have since circulated about how those layoffs affect studios within Microsoft, including those behind some big Xbox games.
Bloomberg reports that the Microsoft layoffs have affected workers at both 343 Industries and Bethesda, according to their sources. The scale of the cuts is not clear, but Bloomberg's report notes that some of those affected include longtime Xbox veterans, who have been at the company for over a decade. In a follow-up tweet, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says it sounds like the Halo Infinite team got "hit hard," citing an email to staff from 343 head Pierre Hintze.
Kotaku also reports that 343 and Bethesda were affected, as well as Gears developer The Coalition.
In addition to layoffs, it seems like movement is also being made around 343 Industries. Schreier reports that Joseph Staten, who was brought on to help bring Halo Infinite development to a close, is leaving 343 to return to Xbox Publishing.
More details have been emerging throughout the day about how these cuts have affected Microsoft.
A shift for Xbox
In a public letter addressing the cuts today, CEO Satya Nadella confirms the 10,000 layoffs will take place from now through Q3 of fiscal year 2023. The news arrives one year after Microsoft announced its plan to purchase Activision Blizzard, a deal which is currently caught up with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

PowerWash Simulator has been a sleeper hit for the better part of a year, and it's only gaining steam. I myself am something of a power washing enthusiast, of which there are whole communities out there, so this sim is right up my alley. The game already has hours of satisfying cleaning content, but along with the announcement that PowerWash Simulator is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, Square Enix also announced that they're dropping a Tomb Raider expansion to boot. The free update will be available to players at 9 am EST / 12 pm PST / 5 pm GMT on January 31, 2023.
https://twitter.com/playstation/status/1615759845625298951?s=46&t=GyZv8BwH84imBShPI-gkHw
"You’ve cleaned a bungalow, a cottage, even a tree-house," says a blog from developer FuturLab, "but how about a manor?" That's right, the new location in need of a powerful wash will be none other than Croft Manor from the famed Tomb Raider series. Not only will the update include a new map to take on, but it will also come with "an all-new mini campaign, with a short story and five new levels."
PowerWash Simulator, is also coming to PlayStation 4/5 consoles and the Nintendo Switch for the first time, in addition to its launch platforms on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox series X/S. Unfortunately there won't be any crossplay for PlayStation consoles or the Switch, but crossplay will still work between Xbox consoles and PC.

While the game knocks it out of the park with how it portrays the dynamic of the lovable Straw Hat crew, the game’s “fully blown RPG” mechanics are a bit of a bore to play through.

Look me in the eye and tell me you can pinpoint the Cathedral of Manus Celes, I dare you.
Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren't your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It's a lovely idea.

One of the most remarkable things about Stardew Valley is how different it is now to when it first came out, and that's down to developer ConcernedApe continuing to add features and content in free updates.

We've put together 19 of the coolest features that ConcernedApe added to the game post-launch that you may not have noticed — things that perhaps went under the radar, drowned out by all the bigger stuff, or things you haven't experienced since putting down the game a while ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The alchemy will take a bit longer
The next installment in the Atelier Ryza series is taking just a little bit more time to get it right. Koei Tecmo and the Atelier team are pushing the launch date of Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key back one month.
This moves the Atelier Ryza 3 launch to March 24, 2023, just one month removed from its previous February 24 date. In a statement on the shift, producer Junzo Hosoi says that in order to make this a "fitting finale" for Ryza and friends, the team has taken on challenges like a vast open field and more expressive graphics.
"Our team will take this additional time to fine-tune the final touches so that we can deliver to all of you who have been following the series for the best possible experience in this culmination of Ryza and her friend's adventures," said Hosoi. "We are making the game even better to make it worth your wait, so we appreciate your patience for just a little bit more until the game's release."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDG_g2tcsNY
Atelier Ryza 3 will cap off the Ryza series, with a note on the site saying this is Ryza's "final summer adventure" with one final secret. It seems like the Atelier team wants to make sure the ending comes together well.
After the summer is gone
One month is not much in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not much compared to other game delays. And if the extra time means the Atelier studio can get everything right, that's a good thing.
The one troublesome note is that Atelier Ryza 3 now launches on the same day as the remake of Resident Evil 4. But its previous date was also in contention with another game, and inside its own genre at that, with Octopath Traveler II. Really, there's little chance of having a big week to yourself in 2023, as a bunch of games are already slated to launch in the first quarter of the year.

One Piece Odyssey is a very easy game. There's a good reason for that - despite its frequently thoughtful writing and near-constant horniness, One Piece is ultimately a series aimed at children. It makes sense that a One Piece video game would try its best to remain accessible to its younger audience.
It also makes sense for older fans to hear "comically easy turn-based game" and immediately reach for the auto-battle button. Luckily, One Piece Odyssey has a great auto-battle system. As long as you're not actively avoiding combat, the computer will probably be able to get you through most fights (bosses included) without issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Man, that's a lot of 2's
[Update: This morning, the official Call of Duty Twitter released an update stating that Season 2 for both Warzone 2.0 and MWII will be dropping on February 15. Warzone 2.0 will see the return of Resurgence and will also get a "brand new small map," while MWII will get some "new multiplayer maps, new modes, weapons and much more."]
Call of Duty fans have been anxiously awaiting Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II's second season, but based on some new info, it looks like they're going to have to wait a couple more weeks. Neither Activision nor Infinity Ward have officially announced any dates yet regarding the new season, but fans have surmised that the release date was supposed to be February 1 by looking at the days left on the Season 1 battle pass.
Based on a tweet from known data miner CODSploitz, Season 2 will allegedly drop on or around February 15. By mining for the dates of the last Season 1 bundle, CODSploitz claims to have found that the final Scavenger bundle will be available in the store from February 2-15 -- hence the supposed Season 2 delay to that date, or sometime after it. CODSploitz's predictions have been right in the past, so we'll have to see if this one helps or hurts his track record when Season 2 finally drops.
https://twitter.com/codsploitz_imgs/status/1615158500493037568
The last major update we saw for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II came in the form of Season 1 Reloaded from back in December. That update came with bug fixes, which added the Chimera assault rifle, the brand new Raid mode, and my personal favorite, the Shipment 6v6 multiplayer map. There's been some speculation that Season 2 will bring another new Raid episode, but other than that, the second season will likely be full of surprises.

The era of Monster Hunter madness continues, as publisher Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion has now surpassed five million total sales on PC and Nintendo Switch.
Released in June 2022 for both Nintendo Switch and the then-debuting PC port of Monster Hunter Rise, the Sunbreak DLC brought with it the epic "Journey to the West" story expansion, along with a huge litany of new locations and both new and classic monsters pulled from the long, long legacy of the Monster Hunter franchise, such as the terrifying flying wyvern, Astalos. The Sunbreak expansion enhanced Monster Hunter Rise's combat mechanics for smoother, more exciting beast battles.
https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1615575865781354500?s=20&t=BIxMDbybdONo5qofHhzA4Q
Accompanying a lovely piece of artwork — posted to Twitter to commemorate the Sunbreak sales announcement — Capcom noted that it would be producing a special in-game pack for all players to celebrate hitting the five million milestone. We can likely expect more details on this DLC in the coming weeks. The success of Sunbreak only cements the incredible global growth of the Monster Hunter brand in the past five years, initially driven by the staggering worldwide success of 2018's Monster Hunter World which remains as of this writing, the best-selling Capcom release of all-time.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Episode one is now available.
Bandai Namco is getting right behind the upcoming Tales of Symphonia Remastered release next month, and in a surprising move, the company has decided to upload Tales of Symphonia: The Animation to YouTube to help promote the game.
The anime is technically three separate OVA series that retell the story of Tales of Symphonia. The three arcs are the Sylvarant Arc, the Tethe'alla Arc, and The United World Arc. Episode one of the Sylvarant Arc, which debuted in 2007 in Japan, was uploaded earlier today, and you can watch it with English, French, Spanish, or Italian subtitles on the European channel!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still say the Hylics games are some of the prettiest around, with their striking mix of claymation and video capture. So I'm delighted to realise that, unbeknowst to me, creator Mason Lindroth occasionally give behind-the-scenes peeks at props and animations on Twitter. It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character's hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.

I played Returnal last year and can confirm that it is splendid, and also that you will grow to hate the kamikaze squid in the final area with every fibre of your being. Presuming you get that far.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It's a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…]]></summary>

Have you ever wanted to know what Radiohead's incredible 2007 album 'In Rainbows' sounded like if it was the soundtrack to an N64 game? Then look no further. The hugely talented on4word has recreated the entire album using music and sound effects from Super Mario 64. The premise is ridiculous, but the results are actually incredible.
Shared on ResetEra, the aptly-titled 'In Rainbow Roads' recreates every single track from the Oxfordshire band's seventh studio album. It shouldn't work, but it does, and it's pitch-perfect. If you've even heard one song from Mario 64, you'll be able to identify some of the sounds throughout this recreation. '15 Step' uses sound fonts from Shifting Sand Land, Bowser levels, and Bob-omb speech noises, and 'Bodysnatchers' has the iconic menu toot, for lack of a better word.

While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn't account for every person that watched the series, but it's a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

January 18, 2023
As you can see, there's not much to go on here, so it's currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

The team behind the genre-spanning SteamWorld line of games is planning a special broadcast. The SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will show what's next for the crew on January 23.
The special broadcast will take place at 9:30 a.m. PT / 12:30 p.m. ET on January 23, 2023. There's no note yet of where this will stream, but a link will be shared on the SteamWorld social account when that's ready to be announced.
https://twitter.com/SteamWorldGames/status/1615725837197656064/
As for the content, it doesn't seem like anything specific has been teased just yet. The team has apparently been looking around at a bevvy of projects, and we'll just have to wait until Monday to see what exactly the studio is doing next.
A whole new (steam) world
Thunderful has been working on the SteamWorld series for years, stretching back to early games like SteamWorld Tower Defense and what many might consider its breakout, SteamWorld Dig. Several more SteamWorld games followed, ranging from the tactical Heist and deckbuilding Quest to another Dig. And, also, The Gunk. Not sure if that one ties into the SteamWorld universe or not, to be honest.
Either way, the Thunderful crew has made some wonderful games that have jumped across genres in the past. The past report from Thunderful included several different possibilities, ranging from SteamWorld Headhunter to a city-builder, turn-based game, and puzzle game. We'll see what new horizons the SteamWorld team is pursuing on Monday.

With Sapphire Rapids there is reduced penalties from engaging AVX-512 -- and for some AVX-512 instructions, no longer any measurable impact -- compared to prior generation Xeon processors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first event kicks off on January 27
Did you get your Charizard or Cinderace yet? While those events are in the rear view mirror (hopefully we get info soon on how others can get them in the future), there's another one coming up, as per The Pokemon Company. Yep, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet players will be able to catch a special Greninja in January via the Tera Raid mechanic.
Just like the previous Charizard and Cinderace events, the following parameters will apply:
You can only catch one Greninja per save file (but you can repeat the encounter as many times as you want for rewards)
It'll be a Poison Tera Type, in a 7-star raid
The event will take place over the course of two weekends, so if you miss one or aren't ready for 7-Star Tera Raids, you have a second chance
Like the prior two events, you will likely be able to create eggs for the entire Greninja evolutionary line, starting with Froakie (so while you can only "catch" one, you can keep breeding them, if history repeats itself)
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Greninja events start:
January 27-January 28, 2023
February 10-February 12, 2023
As a reminder, make sure you prep for 6-star Tera Raids before this date, as you'll need to complete that quest path to unlock 7-star raids. We have a comprehensive guide on how to get that done in a reasonable amount of time here! While the Charizard and Cinderace events were cutting things a little close for casual players, at this point a lot of you are probably at the finish line for high-end raids: you just need to cross it.

We are nearing the grand opening of Super Nintendo World Hollywood on 17th February, when the US take on the much-discussed Japanese attraction will open its doors (pipes?) for the first time.
In the build up to the big day, we have seen a lot of snaps from those who have been lucky enough to visit in press tours and promotion. While the park is looking just as amazing as we would have expected — it is a near exact copy of the one found in Osaka — there are some changes that were never going to sit right with us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's do the time warp again... and again... and...
Sony Interactive Entertainment and developer Housemarque have finally announced a release date for the PC edition of the dazzling PS5 sci-fi adventure, Returnal — The chrono-chaotic shooter will arrive on the Steam platform on February 15.
In addition, Housemarque released the PC requirements necessary in order to get Selene's incredibly visual, effects-laden odyssey up and running on your rig. The specifications range from "Minimum" (720p at 60FPS) to a top-tier "Ray-Tracing" bracket (4K at 60FPS with enhanced reflections and shadows).
For those yet to experience Returnal, it showcases Housemarque's trademark flashy, firework-like visual aesthetic, as well as fast-paced and incredibly "busy" on-screen action. As such, the true wonder of its (literal) death-defying tale of identity and destiny, all set against the backdrop of a massive alien world, understandably requires a decent amount of juice in its myriad gas tanks.
Returnal launches February 15 on PC (Steam). It is also available right now on PS5.

If you’re like me, the question on your mind is, “What are we doing here?” Not in an existentialist sense, but rather, why is this not Persona 3 FES? Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.
In any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.

Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It's the best.

Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

Ubisoft has announced that its celebrated grand strategy title Anno 1800 is finally ready to set sail onto console platforms, following on from its PC release back in the spring of 2019. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16, priced at around $40. Pre-orders are now live on PSN and Microsoft Store.
Anno 1800 is a real-time-strategy city-builder, set against the backdrop of the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Players are tasked with the micro-management of citizens, factories, economies, tourism, and the overall maintenance of industry, residential life, and local politics, guiding the people and politics of the 1800s into what would come to be known as "The New World".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p1TDbV0gBA&ab_channel=Ubisoft
Anno 1800 offers up several ways to play, from single-player stories and multiplayer PvP, to an hour-eating sandbox mode, which allows you to build your own empire unencumbered by interference or regulation. Online co-op is also available, allowing you and a friend to build an economically viable new world together. Additionally, players can send voyages across the seven seas to discover new produce, technologies, and people, further enriching the environment and industry back home, and expanding your burgeoning empire into bold new horizons.
Anno 1800: Console Edition launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16. Pre-order customers will receive an in-game bonus in the form of a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and access to the "Imperial" and "Founders" DLC packages, which will include "Cosmetic Bonuses". Additionally, a Deluxe Edition, retailing for around $50, includes further cosmetic expansions "The Pedestrian Zone", "The Amusements Pack" and "Vibrant Cities."

Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I'd lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The "it" is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don't laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I've actively obsessed over.
The game's an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, "Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will". It still hasn't happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can't find anything else that'll replace it.

They're short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. 
A Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first 'big' release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It's a triumph.

HBO's adaptation of the beloved narrative game The Last of Us has been highly anticipated for months and even years — either by fans of the series or otherwise. Now that it's finally out, the takes have started rolling in, and the first episode has been a bit more divisive among fans than the early, glowing critic reviews suggested. This first installment covered the opening few hours of the game, from its emotional opening to the crew's first steps out of the quarantine zone. Of course, there are quite a few ways in which the show deviates from its source material, which we will cover in the recap below.

With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it's no surprise we're getting a trailer like this today. It's a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There's even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

[Update: As reported by PCGamesN, NetEase has responded to the news that it rejected partnership extension from Activision Blizzard, stating that it found the proposal "rude and unreasonable, inappropriate and commercially illogical”.
“As far as we know, Blizzard’s negotiations with other companies during the same period were all based on a three-year contract period," responds NetEase. "Considering the non-reciprocity, unfairness, and other strict conditions attached to the cooperation, the parties could not reach an agreement in the end.” In addition, NetEase accuses Activision Blizzard of "endless, exorbitant demands, taking free rides, and taking all advantages without responsibilities."

Yesterday saw the New York Videogame Critics Circle host its 12th annual New York Game Awards, celebrating the best releases to hit the PC, console, and mobile gaming market in 2022.
In a ceremony packed full of, frankly, oddly monikered categories Elden Ring was the big winner of the evening, taking home the "Big Apple Award for Best Game of the Year". In addition, FromSoftware's highly celebrated fantasy RPG also captured the "Statue of Liberty Award for Best World". Elden Ring, as you will no doubt be aware, topped many outlets' "Best of" lists at the end of 2022, (including our own), which is a testament to the title's appeal in aesthetic design, gameplay, and atmosphere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In games it's often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.

Bay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as "graphics" at all.
I'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the "classic" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?

At the time I described it as "like The Good Place with more depression, or Disco Elysium with raccoons." Backbone has an ending so bizarre on a literal level that it defies description even if I wanted to spoil it. A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won't answer any questions you might've had about the ending of Backbone. It's also out very soon, on February 2nd.

France's Solidaires Informatique union has called for strike action at developer/publisher Ubisoft's Paris office. The industrial action, scheduled to take place next week on Friday, January 27, is being held in response to comments made by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot over the company's recent financial losses.
The news comes one week after Ubisoft announced that it was further delaying pirate adventure Skull & Bones, alongside comments that implied the company was financially struggling after a particularly tough year for its game sales. Guillemot noted that he was hoping to cut costs at the studio, reducing expenditure by some €200 million through "targeted restructuring, divesting some non-core assets, and usual natural attrition."

Every episode video bud Liam, guides lass Rebecca and myself (reviews ranger Rachel) will highlight a bunch of cool indies and talk about why we love them.

Video game adaptations are everywhere these days -- why not throw another one on the pile? We now know there's a Rainbow Six movie coming from Paramount, and it's just been announced that John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to the project, as covered by The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive. Actor Michael B. Jordan is also involved, and he'll star as John Clark -- the protagonist of Tom Clancy's famous book series that inspired the games. Jordan's already taken on the role of Clark after starring in the 2021 film Without Remorse which was also based on Clancy's work.
This new movie will likely serve as a sequel to Without Remorse, as at the end of the film, Clark is planning to establish the famed multinational anti-terrorist "Rainbow" team. While the first film only took inspiration from Clancy's writing, this potential sequel will instead focus on the team that was made so popular by Ubisoft's game series: Rainbow Six. Details are sparse as of now, as the movie does not yet have a release date or plot summary, so keep in mind that it's all pretty much speculation. Even so, it's hard to imagine they'd pass on drawing inspiration from the games at least a little bit, especially for an action movie.
[caption id="attachment_358479" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via Paramount Pictures[/caption]
Chad Stahelski is best known for his directorial debut with the John Wick movies, but he's actually been around the industry for a long time as a stuntman, having worked on films like The Matrix, Van Helsing, and Escape from L.A. Here's hoping that such a prolific figure in the action space will make unique, compelling work of the IP he's drawing on because a lot of fans are hoping to see their favorite series done justice on the silver screen.

Gunfire Games' Remnant: From the Ashes is making its way to a new platform on the Nintendo Switch. The co-op horror action game is coming to Nintendo's handheld sometime soon.
The survival horror-inspired co-op shooter first arrived in 2019, pitting solo players or teams against a horde of monstrosities in a decrepit urban landscape. Now, Gunfire Games is bringing the action to a handheld format, alongside THQ Nordic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuLxV3g6YU
No release date has been set yet. A sequel to Remnant, currently dubbed Remnant 2, was revealed at The Game Awards 2022. The new Remnant title is targeting a 2023 launch, and will be headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but no Switch.
Rise from the ashes
It's a bit of a surprise, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Remnant: From the Ashes has always been talked up by those I know who have played it, and another platform for the co-op action game certainly seems like a good thing.
In our review from the game's launch, it does assert that while Remnant does take a while to get it going, it does eventually let it rip. The randomization offers a bit of variety to each run, and the urban-apocalyptic world is something special altogether, like a mix between Metro and Eldritch horror.
Maybe the game will find another audience to build up on the Switch, just in time to tee them up for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for more to come on Remnant: From the Ashes' Switch port, and how soon it will be arriving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Live Service Squad
It looks like Warner Bros. and Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League may have some live service features tied into it. A new leak, with details corroborated by VGC, shows mentions of live service features that include a battle pass.
The leaked image circulated out from 4chan and Reddit and was soon picked up by news outlet VGC. According to a source VGC spoke to, the image comes from a recent test build and shows menus planned for Rocksteady's next game. Among these elements are a battle pass, store, and currencies, which would imply some live service features could be in the game.
VGC reports that a development source has said a battle pass is planned, but it would be focused on cosmetic content. The currencies shown also reportedly pertain to XP and skill trees for characters. These characters won't start off weak, according to VGC's source, but will "start off great and can get ridiculous, like Arkham Knight's Batman."

A suicide mission
We haven't seen much Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League gameplay yet that could further back this up or not. Most recently, we saw a cinematic tease of the upcoming anti-hero brawler at The Game Awards 2022. Alongside a release date confirmation for May 26, 2023, Rocksteady also confirmed that Kevin Conroy would be the voice of Batman as well. The voice actor, who played Batman in both the Arkham games series and many animated adaptations, including Batman: The Animated Series, died last year.
This is Rocksteady's first game since 2015's Arkham Knight, so fans are likely curious about how these systems pan out. If these shots are from an internal test version, things could potentially shift. Hopefully we'll learn more about what's in store for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sometime between now and its May release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam's most recent hardware survey says that 65% of PC players use 1080p, but you wouldn't know it to look at Forspoken's system requirements which benchmark the game against 720p 30fps (minimum), 1440p 30fps (recommended) and 2160p 60fps (ultra). 

Regardless of what kind of performance you're aiming for, you'll need a pretty beefy machine, with 24GB of RAM and an RTX 3070 required to hit those recommended specs.

Video games are a pretty darn profitable industry. As it turns out, a lot of people are willing to pay a lot of money to press little buttons. But only a select few button-pressing facilitators can claim to have made the most money. And only an even more select few can claim to actually be good.
High sales don't always translate into high quality. That's not a secret — there's a reason the fine folks at the British Film Institute don't factor box office take into the Sight & Sound poll (I like Avengers: Endgame, but it's not standing side-by-side with 2001: A Space Odyssey). Still, the Top 10 best-selling games in history have turned a lot of copies, and there's got to be some reason they connect with so many players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the little details that make the difference
The Sims 4's ongoing support from both its fans and developers speaks to the behemoth of the simulation genre that it is. Just when we thought the game offered anything players could possibly dream of, they turn around and offer even more possibilities -- which is exactly what Maxis is doing with the release of two mini-DLCs, also known as kits. The Simtimates Collection Kit and the Bathroom Clutter Kit are releasing on January 19 for PC and Mac, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.
The former includes upgrades to the usual set of pajamas that Sims wear, and the collection "will help any Sim look bold, flirty, & charming in the bedroom with lacey bodysuits, a variety of underwear styles & playful boxer prints." Now your Sim can lounge around in style, and of course, the new looks can invite some more spice into your game if you're into that kind of thing.
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1615380171607126016
The Bathroom Clutter Kit takes a turn into the messy -- this kit allows players to customize their clutter, and scatter various knick-knacks around their bathrooms. The items range from Grandma's dentures to makeup palettes, so you'll be able to create a lived-in space for anybody in your Sims household.
Both of these kits were teased in the "It's All Relative" Roadmap for The Sims 4 posted on January 12, 2023, which also announced that the game will receive "one big update" and an expansion pack on top of the two new kits. In addition, there will also be more support for extended family systems in the game, which will also tie back into the big expansion that's coming this year, according to the Roadmap post. Looks like this is only the beginning of the exciting things the Maxis team has in store, and considering The Sims 4 is now free-to-play, it's an excellent time to jump in and join the fun.

In response, they're calling for Ubisoft Paris employees to strike from 2 to 6pm on Friday, January 27th, with demands that include an "immediate 10% increase for all salaries" and the "implementation of a 4-day week."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone whose only experience with the Persona series lay with Persona 5, I dove into Persona 3 Portable's PC re-release with one expectation: it will be old and therefore quite bad. Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I'm delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.
From what I've played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it's well worth a whirl if you're a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who's concerned that a game from 2009 won't be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.

I can't even imagine how long it would take you to do a full journey across it all, but it will definitely take you longer than the two hours you'll spend in the company of Brainwash Gang's loosely connected anthology story game The Longest Road On Earth. But cor, what a lovely, wistful two hours those are all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

January 17, 2023
If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a discussion in our Monday meeting that got louder than things normally do, because The Last Of Us TV show came up, and we found ourselves divided into two camps. Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there's no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was "eh, I might check it out" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?
This was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it's looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That's because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year's House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO's Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon's 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show's gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
"We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success," CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. "Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season." 
"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could," Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. "We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts." 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game's open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss's lair.

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…]]></summary>

He feels great to play, and miserable to play against. He is also, apparently, quite bad - at least according to project lead Ben Brode, who's consulted his big statistics bank to discover that he appears in more losing decks than anyone else. 
Huh. I suppose I can stop agonising over whether he has a place in my latest Patriot deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they've mostly been broadcasted from streamers' homes. This year's event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

January 15, 2023
While most runners don't expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

Due out later this year, you play a deaf hero in search of a cure to a sinister 'howling plague' that's devastated the land around you and turned all its inhabitants into blood-thirsty beasts - and having played its first chapter last week, its combination of tight planning, grid-based shoving and limited ammo a la Into The Breach is very, very moreish indeed. Definitely one to watch for strategy game fans.

In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.

As with those of the FTC and other regulators, their objections are likely to centre on the likelihood of Microsoft saddling Call Of Duty with Xbox or Gamepass exclusivity.

It's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.

A question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.

A number of speedruns throughout the week-long event smashed world records for their respective games and categories too, including PC runs of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and my own personal GOTY from 2022, PowerWash Simulator.

That's despite the most recent swing of Ubisoft's game-cancelling scythe, which was brought down on three unannounced games last week due to the company's underperforming sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desktop Dungeons is a morish puzzle game from 2010 that channels conventional dungeoning into fiendish headscratching. Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. 
Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming "modern remastering" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.

Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’…]]></summary>

A new developer video proves that, offering a fresh look at some sumptuous seas during a hunt for an Ungwanan renegade. The most interesting part of Skull & Bones is still its tortured history, with a recent sixth delay pushing it even further back from the original 2018 release date - but oh, maybe I do want to be a boat after all.

Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

This is my second stint, jumping back in after playing for 14 hours when it came out in 2020 then abandoning it - and I'm beginning to remember why. It's a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It's good, therefore, to see Assassin's Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and "more intimate".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you think of object-gathering game Katamari Damacy the first things that spring to mind are usually balls, and the rolling thereof. Computer scientist and custom controller kitbashing experimenter Dr Tom Tilley had the same thought and, erm, rolled with it. In a case of life imitating art, Tilley repurposed a trackball he’d made from roll-on deodorant and a soccer ball to play the game with (thanks, Time Extension). You can watch Tilley mucking about with the trackball to control an emulated version of the PS2-era Katamari Damacy in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What makes a good platformer? Christ, I don't know. Why would you open an article with that. Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

The pace is high, the movement tricky, the guns have like, 18 bullets in a clip and it's really easy to buzz them all into thin-air. But once a few friends held my hand and taught me to be patient and position myself properly, rather than charge into battle at any given opportunity, the game began to click. And what a battle royale it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror movie maestro John Carpenter has ‘fessed up that he’s not directing a movie version of Dead Space, but suggests there’s another director attached to a possible big-screen adaptation. Talking to Variety about his career ahead of his 75th birthday, Carpenter was asked about rumours he could be helming a non-interactive take on Dead Space. Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn't heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we've decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.

It’s pretty much just the GTA equivalent of an ice cream truck, but for guns. Witness a short snippet of the Gun Van in action below.

I liked time-travelling between Dracula's abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, "NICE TO MEET YOU!", in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the "micro" variety would be grand, I'd love a "microracer". Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I'm desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they're still around and ultimately, what kept them going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it's in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake "Humanity Ends Here" trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks.

So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game?

That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they're going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

It is designed for gaming enthusiasts, content creators, and professionals who demand the highest levels of performance from their graphics card - and now that the next gen is out, this bleeding-edge card has been heavily reduced. In fact, you can now pick this up on Amazon for $730, a $370 reduction from the $1100 price this XFX Speedster Merc319 card launched at in August last year.

Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull and Bones has been delayed yet again, despite already having being delayed for the fifth time last September. It was due for March, but this latest delay pushes it back to "early" in the financial year 2023-24, which begins in July.  
At least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

        <updated>2023-01-11T13:42:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.
While the superhero films of today are often criticall…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former. 
Engage isn’t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console's launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

The company revealed this during its CES 2023 presentation yesterday, stating that the kit is "designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily, more comfortably, and for longer periods on PS5." It seems to be PlayStation's answer to Xbox's Adaptive Controller also aimed at accessibility for gamers. The company says it has worked with accessibility experts at organizations like AbleGamers, Special Effect, and Stack Up, as well as community members and game developers to design a controller kit like this that works "out of the box."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>
