        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

To say there’s been hype surrounding The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would not just be an understatement, but a fairly poor opening line to any sort of hands-on feature.
On an unrelated note, Nintendo recently invited us to go and have a go at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at their European headquarters in Frankfurt. We got a whopping 70 minutes with the game, which felt like no more than ten with all the stuff we wanted to proverbially bathe ourselves in, so how did it hold up? Has this so-called hype been justified?

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game's physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft's pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. 
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft's progress forward toward this acquisition, it's not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA's ruling.

You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2's sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.

As you can see from the gameplay trailer, Flashback 2 is taking something of a 2.5D approach to its platform-based, run 'n' gun action, featuring all the of ledge scaling, dodge-rolling, abyss-leaping excitement of the original, while affording combat new depth through the use of cover systems and the ability to move and shoot both into and out of the geometric plane. Interestingly, the game this footage reminds me of the most is Epic's great 2009 release Shadow Complex, and while Flashback 2 is most certainly set to be something of a modest production and release, this early trailer has promise.

Microids also revealed that it will be releasing a physical edition of the new sequel, which will include a physical copy of Flashback 2 on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch, a soundtrack CD, sticker sheets, a pin featuring the original Conrad Hart sprite, a digital copy of the 1992 release, steelbook casing, and an 8-inch figurine of our amnesiac star himself. This edition will launch alongside the game itself this fall.
Flashback 2 launches November 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

The countdown to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is very much on, and in the run-up to the game's release Nintendo is taking a look back at Link's journey with the Master Sword throughout the series.
From what we have seen of Tears of the Kingdom so far, it's fair to say that the legendary blade has seen better days and, fortunately, all of those 'days' are showcased in a recent video published by @NintendoUK on Twitter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collector and Limited Editions also announced.
In the grand scheme of long waits for a sequel, Flashback 2 is right up there. Continuing the storyline from the classic 1992 platform shooter, this follow-up was first teased back in 2021 for a release the following year, before having its launch pushed back to some point in 2023. Publisher Microids has today announced that the game will be heading our way this November, and we even have a flashy new gameplay trailer to get us in the mood.
The 2022 teaser didn't do all that much to show what this sequel was going to be all about, and fortunately, that is remedied by the latest promo. We can get a closer look at the 3D upgrades that have been made to the series' environments by original dev Paul Cuisset, see some of the shooter combat in action and get a better idea of Conrad B. Hart's new design (much less pixel-y, huh?).

Capcom has released the Street Fighter 6 demo on Xbox and PC platforms — The trial, which launched on PlayStation last Thursday, is now available to download from the Xbox Store and the Steam dashboard.
The demo, much like its PlayStation counterpart, gives players the opportunity to check out a few minutes of the sequel's single-player campaign "World Tour", which sees a custom-designed character grit their teeth and hook up with dopey Luke and his annoying friend Bosch on their quest for "Strength". Additionally, the demo includes limited versions of the standard "Fighting Ground" modes, including Vs. battles, the bull-charging Extreme Battle, and a glimpse at the new Tutorial mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JmxWphGO5Y&ab_channel=StreetFighter
Players can also check out both the Classic and Modern control schemes, the latter of which offers a simpler input system for both newer and younger players. The roster for the Fighting Ground modes is locked to just Ryu and Luke, but they're both solid characters and great for getting to grips with the new systems, including Drive Impact, Drive Rush, and Drive Parry. You should also check out the Level 8 difficulty setting, which is currently raising even pro-player eyebrows with its inherent ruthlessness.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. In the meantime, be sure to check out our reports on the 50 things I loved in the beta, my impressions on the sequel so far, as well as the new character themes, and my suggestions on the 10 World Warriors who would fit right into the new title as post-launch DLC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balls well that ends well.
There’s an approach to relationship counselling where there’s a ball, and whoever is holding the ball gets to speak. Having said your piece, you toss the ball to another person and they get their chance to express themselves without interruption. But here’s an idea: what if you just threw the ball as hard as you could at the other person’s face? Okay, let’s tone it down a little: a friendly game of dodgeball in the safe space of a dream. Add a roguelike twist of turn-based, team-based strategy and you have Desta: The Memories Between.
Desta is the latest offering from Ustwo Games, creators of, among other things, 2014 mobile hit Monument Valley and 2021’s peaceful camera-and-scrapbook game Alba: A Wildlife Adventure. Originally launching in 2022 as a Netflix game and now arriving on Switch in an enhanced and expanded form (although minus touch support), it tells the story of Desta, who is returning to the family home in preparation for it to be sold. Desta lost their father sometime before and didn’t leave things in a positive place with their mum. The anxiety about facing their mother needs to be unpicked in a dream space, letting an imagined conversation play out so that Desta can face the real-life situation constructively. However, the journey to that conversation is full of old friends, and it turns out Desta didn’t leave things sitting tidily with any of them when they went away. Exploring your feelings in dream dodgeball, you must work through tricky conversations compassionately, all while enjoying a bit of semi-violent sport.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honkai: Star Rail throws you into the body of an amnesiac protagonist with unknowable hidden powers who has been awakened from a deep slumber by someone called Kafka. This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.
It’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.

The new teaser trailer confirms that Volume One of Season 3 premieres on June 29, containing episodes 1 through 5. Then, on July 27, Volume 2 will go live with episodes 6 through 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Their name was Pizza!?
Purveyor of video game merch, Fangamer, has released a plush of the protagonist of 2021’s Chicory: A Colorful Tale. And, oh my gosh, just look at it.
Designed by Alexis Dean-Jones and Audrey Waner, this Pizza plush is 8” tall. It comes with a magnetic paintbrush that attaches to their hand and includes a set of washable markers so you can draw on them. It's a rather cute nod to the game, where you could draw on anything in the game world, and even paint your character to customize them.
Chicory: A Colorful Tale was Destructoid’s 2021 Game of the Year. I personally handled the review of it, and if I’m not mistaken, it still is my highest scored game at a 9.5. I really connected with the themes of depression, anxiety, and imposter syndrome. It hit hard during one of the most difficult times of my life, and helped me gain confidence when I was just starting to get my feet on the ground at Destructoid.
I completely forgot the protagonist has the default name of Pizza. It asks you to enter your favorite food at the start of the game, so I named my hero Tacos. I at least remembered they weren’t named Chicory, because that’s the name of the burnt-out bunny who helps you along. I really relate to that bunny.
Damn, that was a good game.
The Pizza plush from Chicory: A Colorful Tale is available now at Fangamer for $32 USD.

Heaven series which includes Riviera: The Promised Land, Yggdra Union, and Knights in the Nightmare. Sting is known for its eclectic collection of RPGs, and Dokapon Kingdom is no different with the strongest heroes in the land attempting to battle it out to collect the most tax money for the king to win the princess's hand in marriage.

While we don't have an exact release date for Bandai Namco's flashy-looking scrapper Tekken 8, (with the good money pointing to spring 2024), that hasn't stopped the publisher from throwing the levers on the hype engine, having already released over 10 dynamic character trailers, spotlighting the heroes and villains who are getting in gear for the next King of Iron Fist Tournament.
Since its inception way back in 1994, the Tekken universe has grown at an alarming rate, with somewhere in the region of 90 characters — should you choose to include all Jacks, all descendants, and guest stars. As such, there is quite the roster to choose from when putting together each new sequel, and while Tekken 8 is already filling up the ranks with fan favorites such as Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, Lili Rochefort, King, and Leroy Smith, there are still many familiar faces, old and new, unaccounted for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p07h8qIsUd4
My main squeeze, Lili, has already made the cut, and she's frankly the only Tekken character I have any real degree of competency with. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't also like to see characters such as Master Raven, Lidia Sobieska, and Anna Williams (imagine those fashions in Unreal 5) join the party. And, of course, there's always room for one of the franchise's finest creations, The Absolute Menace, Lucky Chloe.
But let's hear from you in our beloved community, who are you eagerly hoping will step back into the ring, the lab, and the bowling alley this time around? Are you waiting on a classic such as Julia Chang or Lei WuLong, an oddity such as Mokujin or Dr. Boskonovitch, or even one of the latter-day stars such as Katarina Alves or Fahkumram? Whoever you wanna see, tell us all about it!
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.

Asus has is hosting a launch event for its handheld PC gaming device, the ROG Ally, on May 11. The announcement comes just over a week after Asus said the Ally release may be "sooner than you expect." Given that the device was only announced on April 1, May 11 certainly fits the bill of "sooner than we expected."
Asus is keeping most of the ROG Ally's details close to the chest for now. On May 11, the company is hosting a launch event to reveal the full system specs, price, and availability. A spokesperson told PC Gamer that the price "will be below $1,000. 200% it will be below $1,000." PC Gamer's preview also says the launch date is the same as the stream: May 11.

Gun Media has reiterated the release date for its upcoming The Texas Chain Saw Massacre — noting that the down 'n' dirty multiplayer title will launch August 18 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X as well as reminding Xbox Game Pass subscribers that they will be able to dive into the action day one.
Adapted from Tobe Hooper's magnificent 1974 picture, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will pit a party of hapless survivors — all hippie hair and booty shorts — against the terrifying Sawyer family, consisting of members either directly pulled from, or inspired by, Hooper's seminal horror classic.
The survivors, (or "Victims" to use the game's lexicon), will be required to complete objectives and gather key items from several recognizable locales while staying…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get another look at the things you can do in Tears of the Kingdom
We've talked about the potential of the new building and combination mechanics in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in the past: but it's another thing entirely to see it in action. Although Nintendo gave us the "final" trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom recently, we now have this extra "You Can Do What?" ad to peruse and glean more info from before its May 12, 2023 release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUcBlvw0LSk
Like many other Nintendo ads, the crux is showcasing people playing Zelda together, despite the single player focus. Through several scripted sequences, Nintendo shows off some more potential for the game's core mechanics, including Fusion and Ascend. One player creates an air ship, and another player attempts to cross an aerial track with a makeshift minecart. We also get full confirmation of the Flame Gleeok boss 20 seconds in.
Once we're at the 50-second mark everything flows back to that recent trailer footage: but there's some good stuff up through that point. To be frank this is one of the more revealing ads in recent memory, especially for a game as shrouded in mystery as Tears of the Kingdom currently is pre-launch. While you're fully welcome to go in completely blind, watching it is an option if you're on an unsatiable binge of Tears of the Kingdom content!

My favourite detail is that you can become a werewolf and “do werewolf things”. Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap. Sounds like a week’s worth of content then.

Today marks the 20th anniversary of Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, the seventh entry in the Fire Emblem series, in Japan. But what makes this title extra special is that this was the game that brought the tactical RPG series to the West. A North American release followed in November 2003, with Australia and Europe following in February and July 2004, respectively
Known simply as Fire Emblem outside of Japan, this marked the first game in Intelligent System's strategy series to leave Japan. And in part its probably thanks to two things — the success of the developer's other famous TRPG series in the West, Advance Wars (which similarly also was the first game in the Famicom Wars series to launch in Europe and North America), and Super Smash Bros. Melee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Store your games in style.
One of the most important accessories for any Nintendo Switch owner is a microSD card (or multiple cards if you own lots of games). The Switch's internal memory isn't exactly brilliant, leaving most owners in need of extra storage once they've downloaded a handful of games.
While not the cheapest options on the market, SanDisk's line of officially-licensed cards have proved to be particularly popular thanks to the Nintendo-inspired designs included. Previously, the range has consisted of cards ranging from 64GB to 512GB, but that's all about to change thanks to a couple of new designs headed our way soon.

Larger space regimes require more work, so this expansion is for fans of big government, focusing on Stellaris' collection of leaders, expanding the council system, and introducing deeper character progression. It’s also adding a new Origin delving into the leader who founded your galactic empire, which you can see teased in the very short, very non-descript trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games' Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child’s Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

Funko Fusion is coming to consoles and PC next year.]]></summary>

Publisher Sega has revealed the first 20 songs in the tracklist for its upcoming rhythm sequel, Samba de Amigo: Party Central, with Ariana Grande at the top of the callsheet.
Featuring the patented music game mix of newer tunes with old classics, there are several things here we're not personally familiar with here at NLife Towers, but we'd wager there's probably something here to cater to all tastes (unless your artist of choice is Slipknot, or something).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first official teaser for its upcoming season of The Witcher alongside the release dates for Volume 1 and Volume 2. 
The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill's final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix's The Witcher: 


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what's in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.

Here we go again folks! From April 28 to April 30, Inteleon will appear as the next 7-Star Tera Raid event in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. The Sword & Shield starter evolution will feature the Ice Tera Type, though as always, its exact moveset has yet to be announced. If you can’t fight it this weekend, it will appear again from May 5 through May 7.
Given how frail Ice-Type Pokemon are, Inteleon appears easy to counter at first glance. However, unlike actual Water/Ice-Type Pokemon, Tera Ice with STAB Water moves backing it up is pretty scary. Rock and Fire-Type Pokemon are out of the question, and Inteleon can potentially counter Fighting and Steel-Type monsters too.

-This article contains plot spoilers for Burning Shores-
Media aggregate site Metacritic has responded to a recent controversy that has seen Horizon Forbidden West DLC Burning Shores ruthlessly review-bombed on the site, with many negative user reviews plied with hate speech, tonal abuse, and homophobia.
The DLC, which was launched by Guerrilla Games on April 19, was generally well-received by critics and Horizon fans — And while some players were left understandably frustrated by Guerrilla's decision to only publishing the DLC on PS5, (leaving the PS4 community behind), it seems that this is not the main point of contention for a portion of the players who left negative user reviews.

This hardware family may include some good gaming CPUs but several users have recently reported cases of fatal overheating, sometimes even with their processors burning the motherboard socket in the process.


Investigations by Tom’s Hardware and YouTuber der8auer suggest the culprit is SoC (system on chip) voltages being pushed beyond safe levels during memory overclocking attempts. AMD haven’t confirmed this directly, but are supposedly working on a fix that would prevent this accidental overvolting from happening again.

Introducing something new to me in action combat is rare. In games that feature it, you’re likely using either guns to kill enemies or melee action to take them down, and I’m not often surprised by how this can work. I can, of course, fall in love with familiar combat despite that, but it’s always exciting to experience something I haven’t before, which is what Strayed Lights manages to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite legendary.
Few games have had more cultural impact than Minecraft, but it seems that Mojang has struggled to recapture anywhere near the same success in its efforts to expand the IP beyond its sandbox origins. Minecraft: Story Mode was a decent, if uninspiring Telltale game, while Minecraft Dungeons proved to be a solid, but unexceptional Diablo clone. Now, the company is trying again with the RTS-themed Minecraft Legends and, well, it’s not very good. A litany of small annoyances and irritations ultimately build up to make for a game that, while not without its charms, completely falls short of the simple brilliance of Minecraft.
Gameplay in Minecraft Legends has been billed as “action strategy”, and we would say that it feels like a much jankier and less fun version of Pikmin. In the single-player campaign, evil piglins from the Nether invade the Overworld and threaten to destroy the ecosystem, so the main goal is simply to beat the piglins by either building fortifications and fending off attacks on villages or by taking the fight to them and attacking their fortified Nether portals with your squad.

This means Sega management can now voluntarily recognise the union, or wait for the union election to take place. The newly announced Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS for short) is composed of around 144 employees working across several departments, including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, and live service. 


AEGIS have also teamed up with the CWA, the labour union that assisted other studio’s unionisation efforts and who previously filed unfair labour charges against Activision Blizzard.

In what is absolutely one of the wildest "development hell to success" tales of all time, Deep Silver has announced that its turbulent release Dead Island 2 has already sold one million copies on PC and console platforms, less than a week on from its initial release.
The sun-soaked zombie slayer, which finally hit the market after a chaotic, 10-year development cycle, also debuted at number one in the UK Charts, surpassing new releases Minecraft Legends and Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp and usurping last week's number one, EA's perennial top-slotter FIFA 23. Deep Silver notes that players/slayers have already killed over a billion zombies since launch, while biting the sand themselves somewhere in the region of 28 million times. Nobody said it was gonna be easy.
https://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1650551266337075211?s=20
Dead Island 2, first announced way back at E3 2014, has passed through several developers, went through a number of rewrites and redesigns, and was a frequent running gag throughout the gaming community — A title that never seemed to ever reach fruition, yet simply refused to go away.
As I wrote in our review, the final result isn't exactly a Game of the Year contender, but sports a healthy sense of humor, deeply satisfying combat, and smart and attractive visuals, resulting in a title that will definitely go down as having one of the most surprising "happy endings" in game development history.
Dead Island 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cello choons.
We love a bit of Salmon Run here at Nintendo Life. The Splatoon 3 game mode takes the usual 'ink, swim, repeat' format of your standard Turf War Battle (not to cast any shade, we love a good Turf War too) and throws in the added distractions of a never-ending onslaught of enemies, bosses, and eggs. What's more, it has a cracking soundtrack to make the dash to the goal feel just a touch more frantic.
While the tension-filled tunes might not make the most relaxing listening on their own, Nintendo of America has released a video that shows what goes into making these tracks, and the concentration is immense.

Animal Crossing isn't particularly known for being scary. In fact, the scariest thing about New Horizons is the fact that official support for the game ceased after a little less than two years.
Yet that hasn't stopped content studio Sawhorse from utilising the general aesthetic of the franchise for a rather spooky anti-smoking commission for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Uploaded onto its official website and subsequently archived on YouTube (thanks, Nintendo Wire), the ad campaign is a visual representation of the anxiety that can arise from nicotine cravings. It showcases a cute, Animal Crossing-inspired character hopping into bed before a fiery smoke monster rises up from the floor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't walk away, Renee.
There’s nothing quite like a good Metroidvania. Dense labyrinths to traverse, many kinds of demons/undead/monsters to slay, new equipment to find, hazards to leap, and, most importantly, abilities to acquire that allow you to explore even more. We’ve gotten quite a few stellar genre entries in the last decade, but now we have another that aims to join the most memorable of them: Aurogon Shanghai’s Afterimage. This sprawling, anime-inspired take on the genre double jumps and air dashes with the best of them, though it isn’t without its quirks.
Afterimage opens with a vague, Dark Souls-like overview of how its world has decayed, depicted with a series of gorgeous, hand-drawn images. We understood none of it. In fact, the narrative is a convoluted mess of fantasy pronouns and anime girls; even after a dozen hours, we still didn’t know what was going on other than that, taking control of a young magical girl named Renee, we had to seek out a cloaked girl that stole her master’s soul. Joined by a sassy spirit called Ifree, we were off through hand-drawn biome after biome, whacking a wide array of enemies with whips and great swords as we explored every nook for treasure and upgrades.

Last week, Square Enix announced a remastered version of a classic adventure game, The Portopia Serial Murder Case, that would be a showcase for its AI tech. The tech preview is out now, and well, it's not going over well.
For context, The Portopia Serial Murder Case is a classic adventure game from the '80s, authored by Dragon Quest's Yuji Horii. This actually marks its first official release in the west, years later, and it's got a new visual style and layout to go with it.
Much like the original Portopia, this new version is also a text-parser adventure. This means you type commands in, or speak them using Speech-to-Text in the new version, to investigate and explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worthwhile-est game award
Last time at the Destructoid Institute of Critiquing Kusoge, I looked at Castlevania for the N64. We’ve established that the Castlevania series has never been very good when it comes to its 3D titles, but the N64 games are likely the most worthwhile.
The second title on the N64, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, is easily the worthwhile-est. That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish. More notably, but less noticeably, Konami cut two characters of the planned four.

The union consists of 144 employees across Sega of America's QA, localization, live service, marketing, and product development departments. This is notable, as union efforts have often been led by QA departments.

Camlann Games has given us a little peek at Code::Arts’ upcoming 4X civilization builder, BoC: Birth of Cultures. While the “teaser” doesn’t show much of the meat in Birth of Cultures’ stew, it does portray its scale.
BoC: Birth of Cultures features a world map that is “more than” 491,000 hex tiles in size. I’m no math person, but by my calculations, that’s a lot of tiles. For perspective, the largest map size in Civilization VI is 6,996 tiles. The map is apparently based on “realistic simulations.” Rather than using traditional fog of war, Birth of Cultures instead utilizes the planet’s natural curvature to limit what you can see. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole flat/round shape of the earth is still under heated debate.
https://youtu.be/tBmAIsq0eKg
On this large playfield, you’ll be overseeing the growth of a civilization starting from the ice age. You start as a nomadic tribe and progress through 60,000 years of development. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole length of human history is still under heated debate.
The announcement highlights the size of the playfield and the effects of terrain and climate. However, Birth of Cultures promises a dynamic progression system and features a “sandbox-like combination of progression and cultures.” I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I’m going to assume it’s a bold stance on something.
BoC: Birth of Cultures remains exclusive to PC via Steam for now. It is set to release into Early Access later in 2023.

Publisher XD Games has announced that its long-in-development pseudo-sequel Torchlight: Infinite will makes its official debut on PC and mobile platforms, as a free-to-play release, on May 9, 2023.
Torchlight: Infinite, the fourth release in the high-fantasy, dungeon-crawling franchise, originally released into Early Access in the fall of last year, but is now set to make its official debut next month. In alignment with the launch date, the game will enter its new season, titled "Cube of Rapacity" and bringing a major overhaul to Torchlight: Infinite's loot and crafting systems, as well as the addition of a new character, Escapist Bing, and a variety of new systems, including the powerful "Divinity Slate".
https://twitter.com/torchlight_xd/status/1649871334544138243?s=20
Torchlight: Infinity, while carrying the Torchlight name, is not a product of the now sadly-defunct Runic Games, who created the franchise back in 2009 and would receive critical and player plaudits. This initial release would be followed by rock-solid sequel Torchlight II in 2012. Following Runic's closure in 2017, brand owners Perfect World would release inferior second sequel Torchlight III in 2020. Torchlight: Infinite, now developed by XD Inc. is a continuation of the franchise in a free-to-play PC/mobile vein, and features typical hack-and-slashing, dungeon-crawling action, although presented with more of a futuristic, cyber-fantasy aesthetic.
Torchlight: Infinity launches May 9 on PC, iOS and Android platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vex means frustrate
Apogee Entertainment has pulled back the veil on Emberheart Games’ open-world crafting adventure Vexlands alongside a trailer. It will debut on PC in early 2024.
Placed in a vacant world, your job is to literally carve out your place by crafting and selling resources to buy new tiles in the procedurally-created world map. Each tile has the possibility of introducing something helpful or harmful into your environment, making each one a gamble. Your goal is to strengthen your homestead while venturing out into five biomes to lift the curse that has befallen the land.
https://youtu.be/RjrAMPhi56k
Without fail, a cash-centric approach to an adventure always reminds me of Freshly-Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland. I kind of doubt that Vexlands will center around the populace’s greed, but on the other hand, I hope so.
Honestly, the survival-crafting grounds have become well-stomped territory at this point, but Vexlands catches my eye for a few reasons. The first is that I absolutely love when an adventure has a cozy central base to unwind between adventures. That’s not uncommon for the genre, either. However, Emberheart Games handles development on Vexlands, who have previously done faithful remasters of Apogee classics like Crystal Caves, Secret Agent, and Monster Bash. It’s largely a solo developer headed by Primož Vovk, but they seem extremely passionate and hardworking with their projects, so I’ve had them earmarked since their release of Secret Agent.
That’s to say nothing of Apogee’s newest iteration, which is still helmed by founder Scott Miller. They seem really jazzed about their return as an indie publisher, and there’s a lot of charm in that optimism.
Vexlands only started development a few months ago, but Scott Miller estimates it’s about 25% done. As of writing, it will release only on PC.

A punchline in the third season was basically impossible to hear until someone recently used audio software to decode it over 30 years later.

It's still very early in development (like there isn't even a Steam page for it yet), but it's still an incredible-sounding concept, as every time you start a new game, a random NPC will be selected to become a serial killer. You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!

CyGames has announced that it has had to, unfortunately, postpone its upcoming beta for Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising — Originally scheduled for PlayStation platforms in May, the beta will now take place at a later, currently unspecified date.
"The game is currently experiencing stability issues during online play," wrote creative director Tetsuya Fukuhara in a short statement on Twitter. "While we realize that some bumpiness is to be expected during beta testing, we would still like to put our best foot forward and ensure we deliver as enjoyable an experience as possible."
"In order to test our recent implementation of rollback netcode, we will be launching a closed pre-access beta, followed shortly by an open beta. For those who would like to participate in the pre-access beta, registration will open when we announce the updated schedule. Thank you for your patience."
Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising, which was first announced during the Granblue Fantasy Fes in January this year, is a fully updated edition of the 2020 anime fighter, produced by veteran studio Arc System Works. The new edition will feature additional characters — including the buxom shepherd Anila — as well as new mechanics and stages, a story expansion, and a full rebalancing of all characters.
While not the most popular fighter on the block, GBF:VS is a great scrapper, and this new edition will help extend its lifespan and, hopefully, bring new fans into the fold.
Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is scheduled to launch on PlayStation and PC later in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. 
Whether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.

Following this weekend's closed beta, publisher Activision has released the intro cinematic for its slapstick brawler Crash Team Rumble, which sees the heroes and villains of the Crash Bandicoot universe gather together for cartoonish, platform-fighting chaos.
The delightfully colorful and highly dynamic sequence sees characters such as Crash, Dr. Cortex, "He's Literally Me" Dingodile, and the schlub-bothering Tawna Bandicoot scrapping out on the sunny Wumpa Island. Coco is on their side? Heel turn! Produced by Thai animator RIFF Studio, the 90-second intro is packed with colorful excitement, as Crash — through dexterity, assistance, and sheer luck — manages to get the Golden Wumpa to the goal, scoring a point for all that is good and just in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDHbh-rlKu4&t
Currently in development for PlayStation and Xbox, Crash Team Rumble looks to gather the Crash community for multiplayer mayhem, as they choose their favorite characters and utilize their unique skills and abilities to bring home the Wump Fruit for their team in four-vs-four action.
While tempting to typify the title as "Crash Smash Bros.", the game seems less focused on the actual fighting and more on point-scoring and objective completion. Developer Toys 4 Bob has already confirmed cross-platform support, and the new title will be looking to rope in the fanbase for this new take on the series. No Ripper Roo, no sale.
Crash Team Rumble launces June 20 on PlayStation and Xbox platforms.

Fans of Guerrilla Games' Horizon universe, as well as its irrepressible hero, Aloy, will be pleased to hear that we can expect much more from the robot-filled dystopia, following comments from the studio that casually reference (at least) one more title in the visually-stunning adventure series.
The comments came following a shake-up of Guerrilla staff, which sees studio director and executive producer Angie Smets leave the developer to take up a new role as PlayStation Studios'  head of development strategy. In Smets' absence, production director Joel Eschler and general manager Hella Schmidt will receive promotion within studio ranks, while current studio director Jan-Bart van Beek will retain their role at Guerrilla, overseeing all current and future projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbl2wfyAgxY&ab_channel=PlayStation
In comments discussing Smets' departure, Guerrilla notes that it "[has] full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project." essentially confirming the continuation of the franchise. This news will hardly come as a surprise to anybody in this franchise-heavy gaming zeitgeist, but it's still a nice bit of security for franchise fans.
Most recently, Horizon Forbidden West received a new expansion in the form of DLC Burning Shores, which sees Aloy travel to a dystopian (but somewhat familiar) new locale, where she meets new friends, encounters terrifying new Machines, and takes up arms with a selection of new weaponry. Despite a battalion of review bombs — derived mostly for the most eye-rolling of reasons — the DLC has been mostly well-received by both critics and Horizon fans.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms. Burning Shores is available on PS5 only.

Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it.

Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.
For fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project," the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the "exciting online project" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will "be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine." 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after "an incredible 20 years" there:

The event will be held from April 28 at 9AM JST through May 1 at 8:59AM JST: with a repeat event echoing from May 5 through May 8 at the same time
Like prior events, it'll have the Mightiest Mark (a title unique to these raid events)
It'll sport the Ice Tera Type
You can only catch one per save file, but you'll be able to fight it an unlimited amount of times for loot
Following in the footsteps of prior events, Sobble and Drizzile are coming to Scarlet & Violet as well
Using the egg-breed method in Scarlet & Violet you'll be able to hatch a Sobble, which then evolves into Drizzile at level 16 (and Inteleon at 35). So that's technically three new Pokemon that appear in each 7-Star Tera Raid event.
When coupled with all the loot you get (including Ability Patches), that's not a bad reward for your time!

Capcom has released a new update for its smash-selling remake Resident Evil 4, bringing with it a selection of bug fixes that, among other things, removes the previously published "key item" glitch, and also, (unfortunately for some) puts a stop to a sneaky wall-walking hack.
The new patch, available now on PC and consoles, features fixes to several platform-specific problems, including visual rendering problems on Xbox Series X/S, incorrect subtitling on PlayStation, and the removal of a bug that would render the game incompletable due to a rare bug that would occur while trying to obtain a key item during Chapter 12 of the game — You can now swing your knife with reckless abandon. This patch also tweaks the dead zone properties of the Xbox analog sticks.
But the update also removes the ability for the player to utilize a hack known as "Scope Warping" — A trick that allows Leon to glitch through certain walls while using the scope on his sniper rifle, or occasionally the iron sights on any weapon. The Resident Evil speedrunning community, savvy as they are, had already been using this glitch to fine effect in their efforts to complete the mission as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, once the game has been updated, this option is no more. It seems that launch builds will need to be acquired should the community wish to utilize the glitch in their future speedruns.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Sometimes you need a friend to succeed against the greatest foes. Just like Woody & Buzz in the Toy Story films, you can also have great companions in gaming.
They'll guide you to the next location, give your character moral support, or sometimes even support you in battle. Here are the best companions in gaming history, ranked.

And, for the most part, it works.
Developer Digital Sun, known for their own previous action RPG Moonlighter, definitely makes its mark on the League timeline. A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Come on in. Please, take a seat. Welcome to the inaugural episode of our brand new (and currently untitled) supporter-first indie video show! Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.
My aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.

(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).

Total Tank Generals is possibly the best introduction to wargames I've ever played, but to call it a light strategy game would feel like a disservice. If you're used to heavier fare this may still scratch the itch.
It's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.

Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game," executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. "We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year."
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.]]></summary>

It's a co-op platformer designed to be played by "up to 10 random players around the world" in which the levels adapt to the size of your team and any helpful action you perform earns 'Karma' with which to unlock new characters. 

It's coming in 2023, published by Devolver, and there's an announcement trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing the game during the 2022 Game Awards and giving the game a proper trailer last week, Ascendent Studios is back with a new showcase for the title, this time focused on gameplay. The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.


For a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.]]></summary>

In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

Betrayal At Club Low is a CRPG that we're playing for our Game Club this month, and which understands the unpredictability of a face-to-face wobble of the lips, and how befriending or swindling or aggravating someone is determined by so much more than a single seven. And when all seems lost, how visiting a puddle can turn your entire evening around.

Its success validated Bethesda’s decision to buy Arkane a couple of years earlier, and left the publisher with a promising new series. But despite critical acclaim, Dishonored 2 failed to bring the series to a wider audience. And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.

That's because four of them are available later today: Teslagrad Remastered, its sequel Teslagrad 2, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, and a new game in the West of Loathing series called Shadows Over Loathing. 
Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. 
Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. It then comes to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an alternate world where Arkane made The Crossing, and it’s not necessarily a better one. Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

To put this price into context, this card normally retails for at least $45 and was closer to $60 for Black Friday last year, so this is a good deal that matches the best price we've ever recorded for this size and model - and one we recommend as one of the best memory cards for Steam Deck.

I am but a humble video boy! My only job is to cut out the big "ums" from the audio mix, not writing words about the things we did a chat about! Thankfully this week Indiescovery is all about change, as we're experimenting with a brand new format. A group review! We've all been playing Dredge, the eldritch fishing adventure by Black Salt Games, and hoo boy do we have some thoughts about it. Spoilers: much like Katharine, we all think it's really really good.


Elsewhere, the review bonanza continues. Rachel's been rewriting fiction in Storyteller, I've been reclaiming the wasteland in Terra Nil and Rebecca has been dating hot monsters in Romancelvania. We also chat about burgers, olives and our current hyperfixations because hey, this is an episode of Indiescovery after all.

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

The videogame giant took legal action after the file-hosting site failed to remove pirated copies of games. After a French court handed Nintendo a victory in 2021, the court of appeal has now confirmed that Dstorage incurred liability when it failed to remove infringing content, so must pay Nintendo €442,750 in damages.

While some Nintendo streams start in the wee hours of the morning, this one's not too bad, airing at 9 a.m. on the West Coast and 12 p.m. on the East Coast. The video will be available on YouTube here. After the games are announced, you can see all their eShop listings on the Indie World website. Read the full event announcement below.
Join us tomorrow, April 19, at 9:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase! Tune in for roughly 20 minutes of reveals, announcements, and updates on indie games for Nintendo Switch! #IndieWorld

April 18, 2023
Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.
Which games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original. Dead Island 2, much like its predecessor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve and CodeWeavers have released the latest version of Proton, their compatibility software that allows Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems – like that of the Steam Deck. Proton 8.0 is a biggun, smoothing out compatibility issues for over a dozen games (including the Dead Space remake and Forspoken) while making Steam Deck-specific fixes to many more.
These include an update that should make the repeatedly troublesome 2K Launcher behave itself again, while Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gets improved sleep/resume functionality on the handheld PC. A crashing issue with Life is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.
Downloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

It’s also a precursor to Garriott’s Ultima series, introducing many elements that formed the core of the following games. But everything that Akalabeth invented would eventually be abandoned, first by its sequels and then the entire RPG genre.

I mean, I’ve riddled through The Case Of The Golden Idol’s intuitive fill-the-blanks whodunnits, wrestled with Return Of The Obra Dinn’s sixty missing persons, grappled with the mysteries of the very gods themselves in Paradise Killer, and don’t get me started on Danganronpa’s ridiculous mind-bending, patience-testing murder mysteries.
That being said, ColePowered Games' detective immersive sim has really left me stumped, forcing me to hang my deer stalker on a hat peg in shame and sling my detective's notebook out a window. Shadows Of Doubt is like no other detective game I've played, and although its murder mysteries have left me spiraling, I've had an absolute riot playing it.

The game launches on PC and Mac on May 18 and will come to PlayStation consoles and PS VR2 at a later date. Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shardpunk: Verminfall smooshes together a bunch of different ideas you'll have seen before. It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

The latest is Fabledom, which promises the pastoral fields and castle wall construction I adore, then adds a twist by being set within a fairytale kingdom. It's in early access now.

That thrill fades as complete more runs and reach the game's edges, but its DLCs are so far doing a good job of creating new, uncharted territory. The latest, Tides Of The Foscari, is out now.

The freedom to glide from rooftop to rooftop over haunted Tokyo will bring you so much more joy than any incremental damage upgrade. That's the most important thing I have to say, that it makes for good virtuatourism.
Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

I had left weird abiogenesis idle clicker The Barnacle Goose Experiment running in the background for a few days, dithering a bit any time I stumbled back across the browser tab, until one day it hit me. I don't remember what it was, but one discovery was so strange and exciting that I then sat there for four hours, thinking "I'll go to bed when this result comes in", and then. Woof. I am now far too old to stay up past my bedtime playing video games, and am still tired. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd planned on starting with a line about how Loretta is an exception to how psychological horror games are about trudging around an abandoned mental hospital with the worst torch in the world until the girl from Ringu menaces you. It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. 
What do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

Our impressions from the event were positive, but you can judge for yourself by watching our gameplay clip below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

During the 2022 Game Awards, Immortals of Aveum was announced with a teaser trailer that arguably leaned too much on teasing.

The character then lifts their arm into frame to show the gauntlet… and that was it. Now, four months later, developer Ascendant has revealed substantially more abo…]]></summary>

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
