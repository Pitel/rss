And what kind of witch does their witchy business without an animal familiar by their side? Well, in Hades 2 you can get an Animal Familiar to join you on your journey.


You can get an Animal Familiar in Hades 2 after unlocking the proper Incantation. The issue here, sadly, is that the Incantation won't come your way for quite some time. It took me around 20 hours before the game began hinting I could have an animal friend join me on my adventure. Of course, the moment I figured it out I set out to get a familiar as fast as I could. Wouldn't anyone?

After a few hours of wait, we have finally managed to enjoy the new SBC. In fact, this is Lukeba's first promo item in this year's Ultimate Team. To enjoy the card, all you have to do is to complete the tasks that are part of the SBC. Let's take a look at how to complete the challenge, and if doing so is worth your resources.

The Castello Lukeba Trailblazers SBC has only one task, and the conditions are pretty easy. This makes the latest challenge perfect for relative beginners in Ultimate Team.

The overall rating on this item might be low, but it can be an absolute bargain if you have extra TOTW item in your club. Here are the key stats of the new card.

I really like how this card looks, and the Bundesliga doesn't have too many good options in defense. While it's extremely cheap to complete the challenge, he offers Defender++, and has two other role+. You also get some great playstyles like Anticipate, Bruiser, and Relentless. He also fits in well with the French items that we have already received in Ultimate Team, and a future evolution could make this card even better. As long as you have a surplus TOTW item, make sure to complete this challenge.

A staple of any online video game, this is a particular term that all gamers hate to hear. In simple words, a Packet Burst is the loss of data connectivity with the servers. When the required amount of data doesn't reach the servers in their entire form, you'll get an Orange icon on the left side of your screen. When that happens, your game will suddenly become highly laggy, which, in a competitive FPS, can be troublesome. Thankfully, there are a few tips and tricks that you can try.

Or, perhaps, are you feeling like venturing into sports game territory but without wanting to betray the spirit of the spooky month? I have just the thing for you.


I'm talking about FEAR FA 98, an in-development project where you play the goriest and spookiest soccer game ever conceived. Joining the 22 players that regularly duke it out on a soccer pitch will be the fog from Silent Hill, a myriad of deadly traps, and even monsters out to murder whoever is on the pitch. Also, murdering your opponents is as important as scoring, as their heads are what you'll be using for scoring goals.

It has also announced that they have reached the decision to ‚Äúsunset the game‚Äù rather than attempt to salvage and re-release it in some form.


Many of us were bracing for this possible outcome. Concord may have been one the most prolific and expensive failures to launch. It‚Äôs been reported that Sony bet big on the game, seeing it as their entry vector into the live service games market. Firewalk started development on the game in 2018, and Sony acquired the studio and the property in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 players have run into a roadblock regarding their Ultimate Team experience. A new error is preventing the release of new live-service content, including SBCs.


Squad Building Challenges are incredibly popular pieces of content as they allow players to get unique cards, packs, and more. Unfortunately, an unknown error seems to have occurred, which is preventing the addition of all forms of new content. EA Sports has acknowledged and notified the community, but things look pretty grim as of writing.


EA FC 25 Ultimate Team error explained


There have been occurrences in the past when the planned content released by EA Sports hasn't gone as planned. The latest issue seems to have been caused by the switch from daylight savings. Usually, that shouldn't be a problem, as the content's release time remains at 6 p.m. UK Time. Unfortunately, no fresh content has been released as of writing, and it's already a few minutes past the deadline.




Nobody exactly knows what appears to be the problem. EA Sports has remained tight-lipped on the issue, but you can bookmark this tweet to stay updated on the situation. So far, only the Rush objectives have been renewed on October 29. However, there have been no special fodder SBCs or player SBCs as of writing.


It remains to be seen whether the issue will be fixed immediately or will take longer. Based on the rumors, we are supposed to get an RTTK/Total Rush Party Bag SBC very soon, which will assure you a promo item. Sadly, the Ultimate Team error has ruined the mood of many community members.


Once the issue is over and new SBCs are released, we will be back with detailed guides about their cheapest solutions. In the meantime, make sure to check out the solutions of the Max 88 Base Icon Upgrade and Max 88 Hero Upgrade SBC. These SBCs guarantee you an Icon and Hero card, respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is now live, and we have confirmation about when Season 1 will begin.


Like all the recent COD titles, the upcoming shooter's live content will be divided into seasons. The start of the first season also marks the integration of Warzone into the new title, so the date is of prime importance. Till now, Activision has remained tight-lipped about when the new season will go live. Thankfully, an official confirmation is available regarding the release date. 


Call of Duty Black Ops Season 1 expected release date


We already had hints about the release date from a Little Caesar's promo, which reportedly set the release date of Season 1 at November 14. Now that we have confirmation, the first season is indeed going to be released on November 14. 


Once Season 1 goes live, you'll be able to access the Battle Pass as well. It will be exciting to find out the exact content which will be part of the pass. As usual, there will be more rewards on the Premium version, which can be unlocked with tokens/Vault Edition upgrade.




Season 1 is supposed to introduce Area 99, and Activision has advised the players to unlock all their gears and strengthen them as much as possible. So far, there's no hint of the exact content coming as part of the new season. Players can expect plenty of free content, however, which will span across multiple modes. 


Additionally, the much-hyped Omnimovement and the loadout system of Black Ops 6 will integrate with Call of Duty Warzone. If you're of the impatient type, November 1 marks the introduction of Nuketown to Black Ops 6. Additionally, the Infected mode is also coming to the game to celebrate Halloween. It's going to provide players with a different way to enjoy the undead, but you can always jump to the more traditional experience.

Over the last several weeks, Nintendo fans have been absolutely itching for news on the upcoming Switch successor; news that, if today's announcement is anything to go by, likely won't be occurring until 2025. Alas, the blow has been significantly softened by the reveal that Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will be making its way to the Switch on 20th March 2025.
The migration of Xenoblade Chronicles X from the Wii U to the Switch is pretty significant for two reasons. The first is that it now sits alongside Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (plus all the DLC) on one console, completing the set and making the Nintendo Switch the go-to platform for Monolith Soft's remarkable RPG series.

Both cutscenes and textures can be changed individually, and the additional quality-of-life changes made in the recent update will remain. However, they have stated that these are still the PS2 version of the cutscenes that the port used before, and not the higher quality GameCube version. Our original story follows.]


On Friday, I reported that the 2018 PC port of Killer7 has received a latter-day update that, among other things, remasters the cutscenes, which were previously just upscaled the old-fashioned way. Pretty cool! But like anything cool these days, it comes with a massive caveat: the remastered cutsce‚Ä¶]]></summary>

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at "ancient history" for a while.

I wrote about a very rude Minesweeper "homage" instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 


Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

Digital Eclipse has announced that Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on 10th December 2024.
Priced at $34.99, the retro action game is based on the original Power Rangers series from the '90s and sees the team fight against Rita Repulsa and her minions in a story that both respects and remixes the franchise lore. Gameplay is a spin on the popular brawler genre, but will also add a few neat surprises to mix things up a bit.

The games included are Twin Cobra, Grind Stormer, and Slap Fight MD. All of which are among the best of Toaplan‚Äôs output, which puts them up there on the ladder of shoot-‚Äôem-ups in general. But while Toaplan is perhaps best remembered for their pioneering efforts in the bullet hell sub-genre, none of the included games have reached that point (Batsugun is sometimes considered the first). Nonetheless, they‚Äôre a set of somewhat weird scrolling shooters that are something of a rarity on Genesis. In fact, this will be the first time Slap Fight MD is being rele‚Ä¶]]></summary>

As players wield the power of these dual pistols, they become part of a legacy that spans the Call of Duty universe.


Here's how to unlock Mustang and Sally in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies.


How to unlock Mustang and Sally in BO6 Zombies


You can get the Mustang and Sally build by equipping the Akimbo attachment to the GS45 pistol. First, you must unlock the pistol at Level 28 through standard player ranks. Then, earn enough XP with the weapon itself to reach Level 31. This particular rank paves the way to the Akimbo GS45, found in the gun's Stock Attachment section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen made its debut on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S a year ago, and now it has plans for Sony's upgraded console. Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks confirmed plans for PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, which aim to give the action RPG even more of a visual boost.


On PS5 Pro, Lords of the Fallen promises "a 40% increase in pixel density over the base PlayStation 5 console." Visuals in Performance Mode have been upscaled from 1440p to 4K60, locking the action in at 60 frames per second while increasing the clarity of details in the distance. Character and environmental textures have also been refined.


Those who prefer to play on Quality Mode can look forward to a native 4K30 experience, "showcasing intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS."


Future of the fallen

Since it hit consoles and PC, Lords of the Fallen has had a number of post-launch updates and content releases, including the Clash of Champions boss rush mode that arrived back in May. Hexworks isn't done with it at this point, even without the Pro enhancements taken into consideration.¬†


There are further updates and enhancements on the way across all platforms. While we don't know much about the specifics just yet, many of them are apparently based on player feedback, so it should be interesting to see what they have in store for everyone.


There's also that sequel that was referenced in CI Games' roadmap. Whether or not it ends up hitting the 2026 window with the promised "elevated production values," for now we can get a taste of some visual improvements when PS5 Pro launches in November.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossplay is a great feature that brings together several players from different platforms in the same match in Black Ops 6. But unlike PC users, console users don‚Äôt have the upper hand since aiming with the controller is extremely difficult.¬†


If you are a console user just like me and frustrated with matching against the PC players, then you should follow this comprehensive guide that lets you disable crossplay in Black Ops 6.


How to disable crossplay in Black Ops 6 on PlayStation

Turning off crossplay in Black Ops 6 on PlayStation is very simple. Follow these steps:



Step 1: First, open Black Ops 6 on your PlayStation 5 or 4.


Step 2: Once opened, head to the settings menu and choose the ‚ÄúAccounts and Networks‚Äù sub-menu.


Step 3: In the ‚ÄúAccounts and Networks‚Äù sub-menu, search for the ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù section.


Step 4: In the ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù section, you can find the ‚ÄúCrossplay‚Äù option. Use that option to disable the crossplay.



How to disable crossplay in Black Ops 6 on Xbox


In Xbox, you have to manually disable the crossplay from the settings. Here are the steps:



Step 1: First, you have to press the Xbox Guide button from your controller and open the Profile and System menu.


Step 2: Now go to the Xbox settings and head to the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù sub-menu.


Step 3: Go to the ‚ÄúPrivacy and Online‚Äù Settings and enter your Xbox PIN. Once you have entered the pin, choose ‚ÄúXbox Privacy.‚Äù


Step 4: Now go to the ‚ÄúView Details and Customize‚Äù page and head to the ‚ÄúCommunication and Network‚Äù option.


Step 5: From there, find the ‚ÄúYou can join cross-network play‚Äô option and choose the ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù option.



Also, PC users can‚Äôt disable crossplay in Black Ops 6. That also means any users who have handheld consoles like Steam Deck, ROG Ally, etc. can‚Äôt disable it either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the opening night live event at August's Gamescom, Grinding Gear Games revealed plans to bring Path of Exile 2 to Early Access on November 15. Things have changed, though, and folks who have been eagerly awaiting this one will need to hold out a little longer.


According to Grinding Gear's latest update on the project, Path of Exile 2's Early Access release has been delayed to December 6, 2024. Game director Jonathan Rogers shared the news in a video on the game's official website and social channels, starting off with a quick intro and an apologetic announcement.¬†


"Unfortunately, I have some really bad news. We have to delay Early Access for three weeks," he began. He addressed the fact that people even tend to plan time off for their launches, but said they "just have to do it."¬†




As Rogers noted in the video, the game itself isn't the issue at hand. The delay came about as the result of "a bunch of server-side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected."¬†


Some of this has to do with fulfilling the promise that all microtransactions will work across Path of Exile 1 and 2. To pull that off, they have to integrate the account systems for both games, as well as the platforms. A bunch of new systems had to be created in the process, all of which needed to be backward compatible with the old data.¬†


He said that while he was actually confident they could have made the original launch date, he wasn't certain they could do it without making mistakes. "When you're migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there," Rogers added.¬†


The only strange demons we're looking to battle are the ones in the game, and it sounds like this will hopefully be the last snag before we can do so. Beyond that, the team will also have a livestream to talk about all the content players can expect in Early Access in "about four weeks." ¬†

Happily, it's just happened, and to celebrate the occasion, game director Joe Ziegler chimed in on how the development is going and what Marathon is.


Ziegler's vlog comes in at just under 10 minutes' worth of runtime and I recommend it for anyone even remotely interested in Marathon. On top of the obvious boon that is an honest-to-goodness explanation of Marathon's core gameplay loop, Ziegler also said that Bungie's been executing some "aggressive [changes]" on Marathon over the past couple of years. Promising news? Perhaps, but Ziegler also essentially confirmed that Marathon's Runners will be pre-existing character archetypes instead ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Power ups are beneficial as the different multipliers give you an added advantage against the undead. But they're purely random in terms of when they will drop and what the multiplier will be. In Liberty Falls, the bonus power ups aren't random. Once you find them on the map, you can activate them by just shooting at the correct spot.


All bonus power ups in Black Ops 6 Liberty Falls


There are several important locations in Liberty Falls, and there are five free power ups to unlock. These five power ups are spread across the locations, so make sure to check them all out.

About a decade ago, not long after Minecraft was discovered by mainstream audiences, it felt like every other week you‚Äôd see another new sandbox survival project from developers both large and small looking to cash in on the craze. Now that‚Äôs been replaced by new trends like deckbuilders and extraction shooters, though there are still some worthwhile fresh sandbox releases to be found every now and then. One such game is Core Keeper, which has been in early access for the past two years on PC and only recently hit its 1.0 release state. Fortunately, the wait was worth it, as Core Keeper is deeply enjoyable and addictive.
Gameplay in Core Keeper follows the traditional survival-sandbox game template wherein you push out slowly from a rugged base of operations and slowly learn more about your world as you mine materials, fight enemies, and upgrade equipment in a constant battle against the overwhelming forces of nature.

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. 


It's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.

It's also a well-loved console, so the PS1 is well-trodden territory now. What would go on a "best of" list is generally well-solidified for most people. 


So, this isn't a ranked list, and it isn't a list of the best, but rather games you might have overlooked. I don't particularly like ranked list, since I don't think they're that useful. I say this as someone who's written a few. There's no accounting for taste and comparing something like Metal Gear Solid to Twisted Metal 2 isn't very insightful. Also, I don't really like Metal Gear Solid, and you probably already know how you feel about it. Me throwing it at a low rank isn't going to change your mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".
When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.

The trick to selling this mindset is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while announcing a game you might pedantically observe was announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look up major events in 2011 and there's some world-changing stuff... and some not so world-changing stuff. Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.

The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013‚Äôs The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS‚Äôs development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

If you watch its launch trailer below out of context however, you might be fooled into thinking it's actually the emo second half of an Isekai anime series.

He's got assault rifles and comparison screenshots poking out of his ribcage, which are making an absolute mess of the hallway plaster. He says he is Call Of Duty Man, and he is here to let me know about Black Ops 6's day one patch. The new Activision FPS is out tomorrow 25th October, I gather. Call Of Duty Man speaks only in three-syllable bursts and rolling bombardments, but I think if I listen carefully I can make out the highlights. Here's what that patch involves, in nickel-plated bulletpoint form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zotac are one of the better graphics card makers of the post-EVGA era, so even as the early pangs of handheld gaming PC fatigue start to creep in, I‚Äôve been keeping a hopeful eye on the Zotac Zone. This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it‚Äôs definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs hard to pick out the highlights from the Steam Deck‚Äôs latest SteamOS update, 3.6.19, just because its collection of tweaks and fixes seems to span the entire gamut of handheld PC hardware as a concept. Graphics driver improvements! Third-party SSDs working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED‚Äôs overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you‚Äôre welcome to try if you‚Äôre braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.

Wilmot's Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi. This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say ‚Äú is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction‚Äù. On Monday, Denuvo‚Äôs media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo‚Äôs product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here‚Äôs that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said ‚Äúwe will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Move over Hollow Knight," declared Katharine (RPS in peace) in our Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review, summarising this freshly-honed hunk of POP art as "a deep and challenging Metroid-like with some of the best platforming this side of Moon's Ori games." Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was little, I really liked what I saw of Shin chan, even if it was just largely flashes of his bare arse on Japanese TV. He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as‚Ä¶ jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.
It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that‚Äôs rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn‚Äôt get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you‚Äôll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you‚Äôll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they‚Äôre also a unique selling point. Where last year‚Äôs extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked. By you. Yes, I too am wearing an expression of puppy-eyed dismay and confusion. But it sounds interesting, sufficiently interesting that I can disregard the very loud DYSTOPIAN WORLD framing in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're fondly dreaming of an actual Steam Deck 2, not some half-and-half OLED travesty, you should also be fondly dreaming of a better class of battery. Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been mega substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.

On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-building" and "survival" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a climactic scene of the original Final Fantasy VII, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets.

It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

Yet even I was soothed by the Steam Next Fest demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out puzzle game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind Gone Home, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s d√©cor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.

For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

After targeting a residential address and four business addresses in the West Midlands, police say a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of copyright and money laundering offenses. Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination‚Äôs trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,‚Äù Abrak says. ‚ÄúSo it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It‚Äôs a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don‚Äôt mention the queues?

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. ‚ÄúExactly like previous salary negociations: management‚Äôs proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations‚Äô timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House.

It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn‚Äôt get Ninty‚Äôs seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!
Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.
Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!
