Ahead of the grand opening of Super Nintendo World: Donkey Kong Country this week, some of the original Donkey Kong Country development team spoke to VGC about the IP being adapted to an entire theme park.
During the same chat, artist Steve Mayles - who helped co-found Playtonic Games (Yooka-Laylee) and create the Kong family, admitted he would "very much" like to work on another DKC game. It's now been "30 years" since he worked on the original entry. He also mentioned how happy he was to see the characters he created being "given such love after all this time".

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

As detailed in the latest v0.3.11 patch notes, "player-owned Pals" are now always summoned "near the player". In other words, you can no longer summon Pals with Pal Spheres in certain spots on the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its debut all the way back in Season 7, the Cold Swap has grown to be an absolute fan favorite among the massive array of pickaxes in Fortnite, the latter given its unique aesthetic and charm. 


But true to that, it's no surprise that a question continues to arise among the community. After all, when will the Cold Snap return? Here's when will the Cold Snap return to the Fortnite shop, as well as how much the item will most likely cost. 


When is Cold Snap returning to Fortnite?


Unfortunately for all who, like me, missed the chance to add the pickaxe to their collection when it was last featured in the game's shop, there's currently no way to know when the Cold Snap will be returning to Fortnite. On that note, and given both the item's first release date and how well it fits the Holiday theme, I would not be surprised if the pickaxe were to make a return to the shop during the days surrounding this year's Christmas.


For those curious, the pickaxe's last appearance in the store dates back to June 28, 2024, when it was featured as part of the Clix's Locker bundle.


How Much Does the Cold Snap Cost?


According to the Fortnite.GG database, the Cold Snap has been featured in the game's shop a total of 63 times since its release on December 28, 2018, In all times, the pickaxe could be purchased either alone for 800 V-bucks or as part of bundles ranging from 2.300 to 2.500 V-Bucks. 


Now that you know when we can expect the Cold Snap pickaxe to return in Fortnite, don't forget to also check out How to find Godzilla. If you are like me and cannot wait for the mode's debut, I also recommend checking out All available jobs in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.

"Join us for a new episode of #REDstreams, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2," the company wrote on X. "See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel."




Cyberpunk 2077 surprise update brings new things, but not that


The news of another patch wasn't expected, especially since it hasn't even been a week since the last one. Update 2.1 arrived for players on December 4 with additional fixes, features, and vehicle options. Perhaps something needed more work and got delayed for a few days. Who can say? 





We don't know what's inside Update 2.2 for Cyberpunk 2077, but we know what it will not bring. The company has no plans to ship a PS5 Pro patch for the game. CD Projekt announced the news in November, but that didn't stop folks on X from asking about it. Several times. The game also won't get a New Game Plus mode, as doing so would "break the way the game is constructed," according to its lead quest designer. 


All we know is that it'll bring more "cool" features and break all of your mods. But according to the team on X, "It will be worth it."

Former Ubisoft designer and creator of Rayman and Beyond Good & Evil Michel Ancel has lifted the lid on part of Beyond Good & Evil 2's troubled development.
In an interview with French outlet Superpouvoir (via VGC), the ex-Ubisoft employee, who left in 2020 to work at a wildlife sanctuary, Ancel said "Passion is a fabulous energy, but it can also lead to clashes between enthusiasts. On Beyond Good & Evil 2, for example, there were too many problems between managers."

One of the best things about it is that there’s no end to the variety between them. A game can be about basically anything, and developers are constantly exploring how far they can push “anything.”


I’m not sure Jake Clover's Cape Hideous is about anything. I’m not even sure it’s about something. It could be! Maybe I’m just too daft to see it. However, from what I can tell, it’s just one really strange slice of life told with an extremely ugly but captivating art style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're someone who loves to play LEGO Fortnite, there might be a couple of amazing skins that you can unlock in the near future for absolutely free of cost.


Epic giving away free skins isn't uncommon, and that's done periodically across all available game modes. The recent rumors are from reliable leaker ShiinaBR, who has shared information about the two upcoming freebies. Incidentally, the skins will be exclusive to the LEGO Fortnite mode, and one of them so far has been a shop item. If the rumors are to be believed, players will be able to unlock Mr. Dappermint and Chord Kahele for free.


How to unlock Chord Kahele in LEGO Fortnite




To unlock this specific outfit, you'll need to earn XP on the mobile version of the game. Hence, you'll need to download the Android client and then use the same account. After that, you'll have to gain a certain amount of XP (the exact amount remains unknown) by playing the game on your mobile device. Do note that you can't complete this objective by playing on your consoles, and that's how you can unlock the Chord Kahele skin.


How to unlock Mr. Dappermint In LEGO Fortnite


Unlocking this skin will be much easier, but you'll have to create a LEGO account (or login to your existing account). Once done, make sure to link it with your Epic account (the same one you use to play Fortnite). After you have completed the step, Mr. Dappermint will be added to your account.


Incidentally, the skin has been present in the item shop, so I am not sure what step Epic will take if you have purchased it previously. As of writing, the release date for the two skins remains unknown. Additionally, you'll be able to find the unlock condition for any free skin that gets announced in the near future.

Crystal Dynamics tried to follow up on 2003's Legacy Of Kain: Defiance with the spectacular-looking Legacy Of Kain: Dead Sun, but it ended up being canceled for what I must believe were dark reasons. What we now have is not the full-fledged continuation of the story, or even the now classic soft reboot. 


It's a remaster of the two classic Soul Reaver titles by Aspyr, the same studio behind the damn good Tomb Raider original trilogy remasters, and it does not disappoint!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pro Open Mystery Nation objective has returned to EA FC 25 with the start of a new matchday, and you can solve a simple task to get some useful rewards.


The Mystery Nation objective is a fun task that EA Sports has been releasing as part of the FC Pro Open tournament. A nation is revealed on every matchday during the broadcast, and players have to pick a footballer from that country to complete a certain task. The condition of the task is now available, but the nation is usually not revealed at the start. 


Disclaimer: Article to be updated. 


How to complete EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective (Matchday 3)


This is the third Mystery Nation objective that has been revealed by EA Sports. Here is the condition that you'll have to complete to win your rewards. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 3.




It's exactly the same task that was available on Matchday 2 as well. Once you complete the objective, you'll be rewarded with a Premium Electrum Players Pack. Make sure to complete the objective as quickly as possible, as it will expire on December 10 at 5:59 p.m. UTC. 


The task can be completed in any available Ultimate Team game mode. To complete it quicker, you should try the Squad Battles matches, where you play against the AI. Doing so will allow you to focus entirely on the conditions of the task, and get the rewards quicker. 




As of writing, the mystery nation is yet to be revealed. Once we have the solution, the information is going to be available here, and you can get all the rewards. If you believe in user-generated comments, it's Cameroon. 


That said, we will update the nation once it's officially confirmed on the show.

Where to find Otto's Horseshoe in BO6 Zombies


Early in your match, you can lay your hands on the Horseshoe, also known as 'Otto's Horseshoe.' Open the gates on the left side of the Citadelle des Morts map and head to the barn at D5 coordinates. It'll be right next to the Deadshot Daquiri Perk machine.

The blood-soaked jewels in the crown of a storied cult franchise, Soul Reaver and its sequel were praised on release for original gameplay and stellar visuals. Gorgeous gothic fantasies, co-written and directed by industry luminary Amy Hennig, they followed the exploits of vampire lord Kain’s fallen lieutenant, Raziel. These games are easily the strongest entries in a series that would span two decades, before sadly ending with 2018’s ill-fated online PVP title, Nosgoth.
Now, the corpse is pulled from the Lake Of The Dead and granted new life, thanks to a faithful clutch of remasters from Aspyr (developers of the great Tomb Raider I-III Remastered, also originally from Crystal Dynamics).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil 2 remains one of the most infamous unreleased video games in recent years. This is because Ubisoft announced it more than 15 years ago, later re-announced it a few years ago, and yet the game still hasn't come out without any real explanation for its constant delays and disappearances.


But now we have at least one explanation, because Michel Ancel, the game's former director and the creator of the Beyond Good & Evil franchise, recently did an interview with the French website Superpouvoir (that VGC partially translated into English) in which he discussed different aspects of his extensive career at Ubisoft, including many of the issues behind the development of Beyond Good & Evil 2.

However, the domain was later reinstated by the registrar. This was allegedly caused inadvertently by Funko’s use of AI-powered anti-phishing software called BrandShield.


The post specifically refers to the software as “some trash ‘AI Powered’ Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield” and reports that it “ created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname.” They also state that the registrar ignored their response to the software’s claim and disabled the domain. Something tells me that once they regain control of their domain, it’s going to be transferred to a different registrar.

SteamDB already reported over 200,000 concurrent players a few hours after it went live, but now the game's official accounts are giving us a much clearer picture.




That's right, Marvel Rivals reached more than 10 million players all over the world in 72 hours, which is really impressive for a brand-new free-to-play multiplayer title like this one. What's even more interesting is that this announcement indirectly confirms the total number of players across all four platforms that the game is currently available on: Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

If you were struggling to make sense of what GSC Game World was doing when balancing STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl's weapons, I can tell you now that chasing realism wasn't it. Datamining has shown that this game's guns make absolutely no sense whatsoever, as many have suspected.


Choosing the right gun in STALKER 2 is no mean feat. Not only will you have access to a select few low-tier armaments early on, but it now turns out that you won't even be able to stick with your trusty AK for long, either. According to SMGJohn_EU's findings while data-mining the game, STALKER 2 is way more of an RPG when it comes to gun and weapon progression than I expected it to be. In other words, the fact that Skif's Makarov fires 9x18 Doesn't matter at all for balancing purposes. It just hits harde…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a major one-stop digital storefront for many-a-PC gamer, Steam has dominated the market for around 20 years. It is a convenient place to purchase and play games online, and it's easy to see why this is, but all the sales and discount events that occur throughout the year make it even more alluring.


While we've just had the Autumn Sale, Steam is by no means done for 2024. With the closing weeks of the year now upon us, we still have one more event to go: the Steam Winter sale. But when is it happening, exactly?


Image via RPS.


Well, you still have some time to prepare as, according to a post from Steam that lists all the events of 2024, the Winter Sale will begin on December 19 and end on January 2, 2025. There's also a countdown clock on SteamDB, which shows that – at the time of writing – it'll officially begin in just over 10 days and four hours, with it scheduled to kick off at 18:00.


Winter may be cold, but Steam could be in hot water


As always with these things, we can't be sure what games will actually be discounted until closer to the date (or on the date itself). For the Winter Sale 2023, Steam saw such titles as Mortal Kombat 1, Dave the Diver, Red Dead Redemption 2, Elden Ring, and even Starfield get prices slashed temporarily, with some games having as much as 80% off.


Of course, it's not all bells that are jingly. Steam's owner and developer Valve is currently embroiled in an antitrust lawsuit. The suit was recently granted a "class action" status, with the file claiming that the 30% commission the company takes on games sold via its platform (compared to Epic Games Store's 12%) is "anti-competitive."


Having said that, we gamers needn't worry ourselves too much about that right now. We're getting closer to the Steam Winter Sale 2024 and, with that, the closing moments of what has been a pretty bleak year for the industry. Go out with a smile and more games in your library, I guess.

We know that Nintendo can be a little protective of its intellectual properties (now there's an understatement), but it turns out that the company's micromanagement was enough to make one artist on Metroid Prime 3: Corruption leave his position at Retro Studios.
That's according to a recent episode of the Kiwi Talkz podcast, where host Reece Reilly sat down with former Retro and Bethesda world artist Nate Purkeypile to talk about his experience of working on Corruption.

We'll admit, the 2000 PlayStation title Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles wasn't the first "classic" to spring to mind when we wondered what Aspyr would be remastering next. But hey, it's coming to Switch next year, and eShop pre-orders are now open.
In a new pre-order trailer (above), we get another look at the Star Wars arcade brawler, complete with its new features. This includes all unlockables available from the jump, 13 fresh playable characters (shoutout to the Weequay fans) and some of the classic cheat codes from later releases of the game — Qui-Gon's head has never looked so bulbous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

It's almost time to give 2024 the finger, swallow a flagon of mince pie formula and tapdance backwards into the holiday, but the Maw still needs a little feeding and it has no appetite for mince pies. Nor will it eat tinsel, candy canes, mistletoe, snowmen or reindeer, though goodness knows we've tried. So much screaming. No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is Dragon Age going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual "reinvention".

It's got Subnautica's core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.

"RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a "turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG", which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo.

The real time strategy games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have released a statement committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.
"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. "Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important.

I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun's very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.
"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is some spiteful drama in the Half-Life modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Like this: this more powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme edition of the Asus ROG Ally, a handheld Windows PC that beats the Steam Deck on 720p games performance. With £100 off in the UK and £150 off in the States, it’s now a much closer match on price as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about a player-made map of Caves Of Qud, the reportedly excellent sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you "chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations", represented as 2D Dwarf Fortress-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung Pro Plus is, alongside the Logitech G502 Hero, one of those hardware products that rocks up at literally every single sales event in the calendar. Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in Trombone Champ on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it's the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale. 

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
