Capcom has just announced a new collection of classic titles is coming to Switch, and the pack includes a coin-op game that has remained exclusive to arcades for 26 years.
Red Earth (AKA Warzard) was the first game to use Capcom's CPS-3 arcade hardware (the same tech that famously powered Street Fighter III) and arrived in 1996. It was never ported to any home system at the time, so its inclusion in Capcom Fighting Collection ends a quarter-of-a-century of coin-op exclusivity for the game.

Far: lone Sails was first released in 2018 and it gained quite a fan base – Game Informer gave it an 8.25 in our review – thanks to its unique premise, meditative gameplay, and interesting world design. Developer Okomotive is back with a sequel to it with this year's Far: Changing Tides and it promises to bring all of the environmental puzzles with it. 
This time around, your goal is to move a ship...somewhere. In order to do that, though, you'll need to find new ways to keep the ship powered, discover how to break through an obstacle, and more. In this new installment of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Ben Reeves, talk about the game's opening 15 minutes and some of the first puzzles in it. 
How does it feel compared to Lone Sails? What's the narrative like thus far? Does Changing Tides bring all of the Limbo and Inside-esque worldbuilding with it that Lone Sails did back in 2018? Wesley and Ben talk through these questions and more in today's New Gameplay Today. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming puzzle game from Okomotive, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on March 1.]]></summary>

Capcom’s weeklong countdown clock has expired and on the other side is the announcement of Street Fighter 6.
The reveal fittingly came at the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour. The cinematic teaser showed a face-off between Ryu and Luke, the final DLC fighter to join Street Fighter V who Capcom previously said would play an important role in the franchise's future. The art style resembles a more traditional 3D look compared to the ink brush style that defined Street Fighters 4 and 5, though this could only be for the trailer and not indicative of the in-game graphics. Unfortunately, nothing else was revealed other than the promise of more information coming this summer.

Shortly after the reveal, Yusuke Hashimoto, the director of Bayonetta 2 who has also worked on the Resident Evil series and God Hand, announced on Twitter that he's among the game's designers. 
Street Fighter 6, the newest entry in the Street Fighter series, has finally been revealed!

But wait, there's more! Capcom also announced the 10-game Capcom Fighting Collection, a bundle of classic and niche fighting games that includes a wealth of Darkstalkers titles. You can read more about that announcement here.

Umožňují pracovat jednotným způsobem s řadou formátů (ASN.1, INI, MIME, YAML, JSON, CBOR, HTML, XML) a vytěžit z nich informace podobným způsobem jako to dělá databázová funkce XMLTable s daty ve formátu XML.

Můžeme se napojit na systém X11 a vypsat si otevřená okna, obrazovky či vstupní zařízení nebo zachytávat i generovat události (pohyby myši, stisky kláves).

Z obrázků můžeme načítat čárové a QR kódy a to včetně souřadnic kódu (na obrázku jich může být víc).

Filtry pro čtení a zápis CSV nově podporují datové typy (text, číslo, boolean) a to jak explicitně uložené v CSV, tak jejich autodetekci.

Filtry pro pro práci s INI soubory podporují řadu dialektů (formát INI není standardizovaný) včetně klasických unixových konfiguračních souborů typu klíč=hodnota nebo javovských .properties a MANIFEST.MF souborů.

Relational pipes jsou datový formát pro popis relačních dat + související nástroje, které slouží jako vstupní či výstupní filtry nebo transformace. Myšlenkově navazují na klasické unixové roury (skládání příkazů, každý program dělá jednu věc) a relační databáze.]]></summary>

A new leak has revealed nine new Nintendo-themed Lego sets are on the way, one of which will cost $229.99 – the same amount the NES Lego set retailed for (thanks, VGC).
The sets were discovered as listings on Eugene Toy & Hobby under the codename ‘Leaf’ – the same codename used for all of the products in the line. The listings were taken down shortly after being discovered, but the numbers relate to listings spotted by German Lego fansite Promobricks last year. The site was not aware that the listings were Nintendo-related at that time.

Assembled by a team of former Mana series veterans at Brownies and released on 10th February, Egglia Rebirth is a cracking good RPG on Switch that began life on mobile devices. Egglia, in its initial incarnation, was one of the company's first projects after Shinichi Kameoka left Brownie Brown — the team that worked on the legendary Mother 3 — when it was restructured and renamed by Nintendo.
We recently had a chance to interview Shinichi Kameoka, President and CEO of Brownies, and quiz him on Egglia Rebirth, its journey to Switch, and his involvement with that ever-elusive GBA title mentioned above...

It’s just as well one can never have too many shoot-'em-ups, because, no bones about it, Raging Blasters is absolutely fantastic. A Japan-only release on Switch (though available on Steam) that's magically entirely in English from top to bottom, this is the kind of indie-gaming labour of love that deserves a great lungful of hilltop-screaming. Breakneck paced with rarely any let-up, Raging Blasters is a love letter to Compile shmups that borrows heavily from the likes of Zanac.
Its presentation is superb, from the character designs to the beautifully colourful graphics and racing parallax. There’s a nice weight to the various craft and explosions, complimented by crackling sound effects. While the rolling backgrounds are simple in theme and very reminiscent of Zanac Neo’s opening stage (PS1), their deep-space tech elements are nonetheless rendered with attractive artistic heft and lovely colour casting.

Nightdive Studios has shot to fame in recent years - remastering classics like Turok, Shadow Man and most recently the Sega Saturn and PlayStation classic, Powerslave Exhumed.
As much as it loves reviving these sorts of games, there's still one company, in particular, it would like to help out... it's Nintendo. According to CEO, Stephen Kick, Nightdive has "had discussions with Nintendo" about remastering certain classic titles but hasn't had any luck convincing it.

Yacht Club Games is a company that needs little introduction, particular thanks to the huge success and acclaim for Shovel Knight, a title that had multiple major expansions and campaigns over a number of years. The company has been busy beyond that too; last year it published Cyber Shadow and collaborated with Vine on Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon. For fans of the core development team's output, though, this year has already brought exciting news with the announcement of Mina The Hollower.
It currently has a Kickstarter campaign that's both raising funds and engaging with an enthusiastic community, having already smashed its goal. It's not expected until December 2023, but we also got to go hands on with an early PC build, having a jolly time in the process. It's challenging, nails the Game Boy Color aesthetic, and combines classic gameplay ideas with new touches and clever design.

As much as we're enjoying Nintendo Switch Sports this weekend, it's got us wondering what's going on with Nintendo's Mii.
For a while now, it seems like they've been on the way out. So, what's up? Nintendo is still incorporating them into games, but instead of placing them in the spotlight, they're now more of an optional extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like Dungeons and Dragons, but underwater and in space.
In Other Waters is a surprising little gem of a game that came to the Switch back in 2020, telling the story of an alien ocean through little more than a three-colour dashboard, full of knobs and switches. You experience the story, and the world, through the descriptions of biologist Dr Ellery Vas, as you help her pilot an AI exoskeleton into the depths.
The game is made largely by one person: Gareth Damian Martin, a jack-of-all-trades type who's worked in graphic design, writing, games testing, and game design, as well as earning a PhD in literature. It may come as no surprise, then, that Gareth is spinning off In Other Waters into a tabletop role-playing game, while they're also working on Citizen Sleeper — a video game inspired by tabletop role-playing games. Talk about crossing the streams, eh?

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Last week, we kicked things off with Drake's Fortune, and now we move on to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the superb sequel that catapulted the franchise into the stratosphere.  
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves launched October 13, 2009, just shy of two years after Drake's Fortune. Now that it had a solid foundation to work with, Naughty Dog set out to create the video game equivalent of a summer blockbuster film. That included eschewing cutscene setpieces in favor of technically impressive gameplay moments that still offered control over the action, such as the game's famous train sequence. The writing and characters shone even brighter, from Nate himself to newcomer Chloe Frazer to everyone's favorite girl next door, Elena Fischer. Uncharted 2 also introduced a surprisingly solid multiplayer mode, rounding out a stellar package that went on to win numerous Game of the Year awards (ours included). 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and IGN Senior Editor Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) as we unpack the development history and impact of Nathan Drake's magnum opus. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Talia: The Wind Wannabee.
When someone talks about spiritual successors in the video game industry, a few names immediately come to mind. Stardew Valley, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and Yooka-Laylee all aimed to bring back genres synonymous with long dormant franchises. If a spiritual successor exists to bring back something players haven’t seen in a long time, it's fair to ask what’s the point in creating a homage to The Legend of Zelda, which is an annual franchise? There's no shortage of them, that's for sure, and Ocean’s Heart is the latest to adopt the top-down Zelda formula, the likes of which Nintendo hasn't produced since A Link Between Worlds in 2013 (discounting Grezzo's Link's Awakening remake, of course). Even though this game pulls heavily from Nintendo's template and stumbles in places, developer Max Mraz delivers an enjoyable take on top-down 2D adventuring.
If you took a quick glance at Ocean’s Heart, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was a long lost sequel to the Minish Cap. Everything about the atmosphere, from the sprite work to the music, seems to be pulled directly from the GBA Zelda game. Even the protagonist, Tilia, looks to just be a modified version of Link’s sprite. And while some might find it shamelessly derivative, where Ocean’s Heart stands out a bit more is in the locales you visit. From large sunflower fields to a town heavily inspired by Greek architecture, the unique environments give the game a much needed sense of identity it otherwise lacks. And while few and far between, even familiar environmental tropes stand out with slight variations on their traditional design, like an autumn grassland.

It's a welcome change because Nintendo systems have historically lagged a little behind other consoles in the FPS field despite hosting some classics.

Another week, another dollar. Err, yes — that's how that saying goes. Various things happened this week in the world of Nintendo, but by far the biggest story was definitely the lovely Felix joining our lovely video team.
What's that? Oh yes, there was also the matter of Nintendo's announcement of its closure schedule for the 3DS and Wii U eShops, with an estimated 1000+ games to be removed from sale. We spoke to a source who believes a full network shutdown for those consoles could come soon after, and we set about reminiscing and compiling lists of our favourite 3DS eShop and Wii U eShop games to pick up before it's too late.

Their face was mangled, with eyes popping out the sides, as the mace destroyed everything between their nose and the cowlick on the back of their head.

Cyberpunk 2077 received a massive 60+ GB update called Patch 1.5 earlier this week, and it’s been aptly referred to as the new-gen update for CD Projekt Red’s latest RPG. Perhaps you waited until you had a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X to play it, knowing full well how terribly the game runs on prior-gen consoles. Maybe you were hoping to get your hands on a graphics card from Nvidia’s impossibly rare 30XX series. No matter what situation you…]]></summary>

If Pokémon were real, you can bet there would be a lot more posts on Twitter about Snorlaxes blocking the M25, or a Psyduck coming in through your cat flap.

I'll be honest; I came up with this headline before I thought about what this article would really be about. Because, realistically, what can I say here? "Remember that blockbuster gaming franchise that everyone loves and has just gotten a film adaptation? They should make more of those." It's kind of a "no duh" situation. I'm not the first person to say they liked *good thing* and want another *good thing*. I should probably say something a little more sensational. Okay, fine: Uncharted is an incredibly unique, industry-shaping series that resonated with me powerfully, and we deserv…]]></summary>

Well, Ubisoft have made their stupid-ass stance on NFTs quite clear, so let's move on to question two. In a recent financial conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said they think they're good to stand independent, but if someone had a juicy offer, well, they might think about it. But that's a noncommittal business answer, really, just business as usual.

Cuphead made me shout obscenities at a flower. Its cheerful dragon tempted me to head-butt my television. And the candy princess? Oh, you don’t even want to know. I didn’t appreciate it until much later, but those early maddening hours with Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer were like a kiln, hardening my skills and turning me into the best damned Cuphead player that I could be.

Today, the long-anticipated sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, and to celebrate, we're going to stream the early hours of the game. Join associate editor John Carson (AKA the King of Late Night) on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as he jumps into the post-post-apocalyptic world of Horizon Forbidden West.

You may be thinking, "But, John, where's Super Replay? I want to see Marcus be a badass Jedi." I hear you, and I'd like to see that as well. We're giving the Replay crew the day off to enjoy the long holiday weekend, and they'll be back to their usual antics next Friday.
Horizon Forbidden West is the newest game from PlayStation powerhouse studio Guerrilla Games, and the second entry in the Horizon franchise. Set in the distant future where civilization as we know it has crumbled and mechanical beasts roam the land, Horizon follows the adventures of Aloy, who was once a societal outcast, that has become a hero to many of the villages and tribes she meets in Zero Dawn. Forbidden West brings Aloy, well, further west to discover a way to stop a blight that's killing the land and, in turn, what remains of humanity. Check out cool robotic creatures and the beautiful open-world vistas that await Aloy on the stream this afternoon.]]></summary>

Square Enix announced back in December that its Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster would be releasing this February, and now we know it’s coming next week on February 23. Since revealing that release date, Square Enix has released some footage from the remaster and fan response has been mixed. 
Unless you’re talking about this tweet made by the official Final Fantasy Twitter account on February 13, which seemingly nobody was happy about. As you can see in the tweet below, it features an infamous move from Final Fantasy VI where you can use meteor strike to essentially suplex the Phantom Train. In the original release, the train flips over a la like a suplex. …]]></summary>

Ironically for a game about a never-ending timeloop, I just never had enough minutes to fit it into my schedule. But! I have been rectifying that this week, and cor, it's a bit good, isn't it? I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. 
As you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place. And some of them look very familiar indeed...

Stealth and patience are crucial to victory in a world where aliens aren't just shambling meat sacks, but a horrifying hivemind that's best tackled quietly.
But after spending a little hands-on time with Extraction's new game mode Spillover, it seems it  does away with what makes the base game tick. You plant bombs, then fend off hordes of aliens. There's something missing here.

Skull & Bones was announced in 2017 and other than a few trailers and gameplay showcases, things have remained mostly quiet on it. In fact, much of the news that has since come out about Skull & Bones has been regarding delays, directors leaving, and more. Just last month, it was revealed that one of the game’s co-directors departed from Ubisoft. 
It seems that Ubisoft is confident Skull & Bones will finally escape the clutches of development hell soon, though, because in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report, Ubisoft CEO Frédérick Duguet said it could release next fiscal year. More specifically, if Dugu…]]></summary>

Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.
You're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.

WWE 2K’s simulated grappling can be fun, but there’s something satisfying about booking your own shows, managing contracts, and drafting wrestlers, which is why 2K22’s MyGM mode is attractive. I got to sit down with this latest reinvention of the fan-favorite mode, guiding my chosen brand through a 15-week ratings war. 
Conceptually, this mode has always been an interesting conundrum. Pro wrestling is a scripted sport by design, and that includes having characters portray authority figures who run things on TV but have no actual power in real life. That begs the quest…]]></summary>

This will give Amazon the first opportunity to snap up anything DJ2 Entertainment might be making, if they want to. This is not, however, an announcement that Amazon will make these specific shows.

On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew is joined by Kinda Funny's Greg Miller to discuss Horizon Forbidden West review impressions and the upcoming Nintendo eShop closures on 3DS and Wii U systems. We also briefly discuss our time playing Lost Ark, Rune Factory 5, and OlliOlli World. Lastly, a listener question sparks a conversation about which video game characters we would draft as the new Suicide Squad – and my controversial pick might surprise you!
Spoiler: I chose Tingle because I hate that creepy video game toddler man and hope we finally bury him.

Aloy and company are finally back after five long years in Horizon Forbidden West, and we're streaming the beginning of the game live on Twitch starting at 2:15 p.m. CT!
Click here to watch embedded media
Who will be hosting such an event? We got a good one for you today with Alex Stadnik on the sticks, Ben Reeves chiming in with his experience with the game and his usual brand of street comedy, and Kim "KStar" Wallace giving her impressions as we progress through the opening two hours. Ms. Wallace did the official Game Informer review, and in it, she says: 
"Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon's fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it's an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights."

For those unfamiliar with the Horizon series, the game's star Aloy, a hero born to save a mechanical world from the sins of the past. Our protagonist has delved deep into this world's history to learn of her connections to the woman who kept life going at a great cost thousands of years ago and how that connection makes her the only person on Earth who can prevent a new mechanical apocalypse. Forbidden West continues that tale with a cast of new and familiar faces, a vastly improved combat and movement system, and some of the best graphics we've seen on the PlayStation 5!
Can't get enough Horizon ahead of the game's official release? We've got you covered with the video version of Kim's excellent review, a whole cover hub featuring stories on developer Guerrilla Games' newest experience, and an in-depth conversation about the game on the latest episode of The GI Show!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime streaming app Crunchyroll has launched on Switch today. 
That's noteworthy for two reasons. One, it adds another streaming service to Switch, a platform with minimal options for watching TV and movies. Switch owners still only have Hulu, YouTube, Funimation, and Pokémon TV to turn to. There’s also Twitch if you prefer watching streamers. Two, it comes after Sony’s billion-dollar acquisition of the service in December 2020, showing that the company has no intention to prevent Crunchyroll from further spreading its wings to other platforms. 
Crunchyroll on Switch, which is powered by Unreal Engine, is the first video app on the console to offer offline viewing. That means you won’t need an internet connection to catch up on Demon Slayer should you decide to fire up the app at the park or on a car ride. Crunchyroll is a subscription service boasting one of the largest anime libraries, even letting fans stream shows the same day they premiere in Japan. 
While a nice addition, the Switch still lacks streaming heavyweights like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and others which has been frustrating for owners who want to take advantage of its portability to watch their favorite shows anywhere. If you’re not into anime, that leaves Hulu as the only real option. Hopefully, that changes, but given that the Switch has gone five years without even Netflix, it's probably best not to get your hopes up.]]></summary>

It's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.
My first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.
I was a fool. A big, wrong fool.

Long before Techland’s Dying Light series, the developer made waves in the open-world, zombie-slaying community with Dead Island, an unconventional, tropical take on the beloved post-apocalyptic formula. Dead Island boasted a 4-player coop campaign, zany, moddable/craftable weapons that Dying Light is currently known for, and a satisfying balance of horrifying and comedic gameplay. Perhaps you can already see why Dead Island 2 was an exciting prospect for players that wanted a similar experience with updated visuals and mechanics. And despite the radio silence and rumors of development hell, Dead Is…]]></summary>

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.
Sadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture.

Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 will likely be released in 2023 after years of development, including time spent in Early Access. 
This news comes by way of PCGamesN, which recently spoke to Larian head Swen Vincke about the status of the RPG. According to Vincke, the team needs another year of development, but this year will be the last full year required for work on the game.

“We’re going to release it when it’s ready,” Vincke said. “I mean, the main goal here is quality: getting the game at the quality level that it needs to be. That said, we do think we still need a year to do that. But it will be the last year. We’re getting to the end of it.”
When asked about the launch, Vincke told PCGamesN that it’s “probably not this year, but it’s not going to be much later than that.” It sounds like 2022 is off the table, but 2023 is a sure bet. Of course, anything could happen between now and then that could push back release expectations, but it sounds like if things go according to plan, we’ll all be playing the final version of Baldur’s Gate 3 next year. 
In the meantime, read about this Baldur’s Gate 3 update that includes new “game-changing” mechanics, fine-tuned roleplaying, and more, and then check out the Druid class recently added alongside a loaded dice option, better cinematics, and multiplayer functionality. Watch this fantastic cover of Baldur’s Gate 3’s “Down By The River” after that.

Did you miss out on Persona 4 when it took the world by storm in 2008? Did you also miss out on its augmented "Golden" edition? I did. Even though the latest version has been miraculously available on the Steam storefront for a little under two years, Persona devotees were disappointed to see the JRPG absent from the Steam Deck's list of supported games. However, the portable PC's latest software update should please any Atlus fans looking to relive their fond memories of playing Golden on the go. Persona 4 is finally Steam Deck compatible.

Rare is bringing more content to Sea of Thieves in 2022 than any year prior, it seems, and it’s mostly doing that by adding new live events called Adventures to keep players enthralled in an ongoing story each month. The first one, Shrouded Islands, is now live in-game and players have from now until March 3 to complete it. 
To help celebrate the release of the first-ever Sea of Thieves Adventure, Rare has released a new gameplay trailer that serves as a primer for Shrouded Islands. You can check it out below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old chestnut from gaming mythology - you surely know the one - about the movement in Mario’s 3D ventures being perfected by Shigeru Miyamoto at their very start with Super Mario 64. Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. 
Really though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. 
The next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it feels like we've been hearing about the TV series based on The Last of Us for quite some time, it looks like the show is further down the road than we realized. In an interview with Deadline, HBO and HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys revealed the show is set to debut as early as next year.
“It’s not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23,” said Bloys to Deadline. "Craig [Mazin] did Chernobyl for us, he is a fantastic writer and director. What I’ve seen looks amazing, so I’m excited for it, but it will not be in ’22." While it's unfortunate that we won't see The Last of Us adapted this year, it sounds like everything is very much still in production and on track to be completed by sometime in 2023.
Another interesting quote from the interview came from Deadline asking whether The Last of Us was seen internally as the next Game of Thrones. To which Bloys replied, "There is no next Game of Thrones. I’ve been here long enough that I’ve been through, what’s the next Sopranos, what’s next Game of Thrones, now what’s next Succession. There is no next Game of Thrones.” 
The Last of Us follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only are the horrific zombie-like Infected an ever-present threat, but so too are other remaining humans scratching and clawing to stay alive or stay in power. The duo must traverse the United States to deliver Ellie to a promised destination. Other cast members include Anna Torv as Tess, Nick Offerman as Bill, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge as Marlene.]]></summary>

People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5's power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can't play anywhere else.

Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin may be a weird spin for the series, but one traditional staple remains present: the Job system. 
Jobs are basically roles you can assign to each party member that determine what abilities and weapons they utilize. Stranger of Paradise boasts 27 jobs and three of them are brand new to the series. The PlayStation Blog provides a rundown of what some of these jobs entail, including the ones exclusive to the title.
The jobs unique to Stranger of Paradise are Breaker, Void Knight, and Tyrant.  
Breaker lets players wield the legendary sword Zantetsuken (famously wielded by classic FF summon Odin) to smash through defenses and potentially land one-hit kills. Square describes this as a trickier playstyle to master but one that can have big payoffs.
Void Knight allows you to counter enemy magic attacks, either by absorbing and converting them to MP or turning back against their casters.  
Tyrant buffs your normal attacks with elemental attributes to devastate enemies vulnerable to a particular element. 
Other classes revealed so far include Swordsman (which protagonist Jack begins as), Dark Knight, Black Mage, Sage, Ninja, Paladin, and Thief. At their core, these jobs function the way old-school fans would assume but expect a more action-oriented slant. For example, Sage lets you quickly swap between white and black magic for some fast-paced spellcasting.
You can read more details on each revealed class by visiting the PlayStation Blog. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch the latest Frank Sinatra-themed trailer here.]]></summary>

Sony San Diego has revealed that its upcoming baseball game, MLB The Show 22, will be getting a technical test starting tomorrow, February 17, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch. 
It’ll begin at 10 a.m. PST and will last until February 23 at 10 a.m. PST giving players in the U.S. and Canada a week to try out the game ahead of its April 5 release. As for what to expect, the technical test seems primarily focused on stress testing MLB The Show 22’s online servers and functions.

“We want to deliver the best version possible of MLB The Show 22 and to do that, we need everyone’s help to stress the servers, online matchmaking, cross-platform play, online co-op, and more in addition to gathering feedback on gameplay,” Sony San Diego writes in the description of its trailer for this announcement. “The best news? No need to sign up [as] it’s open to everyone eligible.” 
You need only to download the technical test to participate and if you’re planning to play on a PlayStation console, you can download it right now so that when it’s live tomorrow, you’re all set to hit the mound. Because co-op is enabled, you can play 2vs or 3v3 online. Plus, because the test is open to all, you can post whatever you want from it on social media. 
This technical test is especially exciting because it’s the first chance to play MLB The Show 22 on Switch. This year’s baseball game from Sony San Diego is the first time an MLB The Show game will be released on a Nintendo platform.

Studio animations that play before movies are nothing new. Popularized by the likes of Marvel Studios (although who could forget the build-up of Fox 20th Century’s snare-centric intro animation), it’s not uncommon to see some flashy animation from a studio that lets you know, “Hey, this is a movie made by us.” 
That’s the case with PlayStation’s movie arm, PlayStation Productions, which is set to release its Tom Holland-led Uncharted movie in theaters this Friday. When you sit down to watch it, you’ll see a new PlayStation Productions animation, too, that features PlayStation mascots such as Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy, Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai (who is also getting a own movie), God of War’s Kratos and Atreus, The Last of Us’ Joel and Ellie (which we’ll see in HBO’s upcoming show based on that game later this year), and Asto Bot, too. 
Is that a new PlayStation Productions animation? 👀

February 15, 2022
Of course, you’ll spot Nathan Drake from Uncharted, Sackboy, and Ratchet & Clank as well. And, if this new animation is anything like Marvel Studios’, it’ll change over time to include new and returning faces. 
You’ll be able to see this PlayStation Productions animation when it plays before Uncharted starting February 18. While waiting for that, read Game Informer’s Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out Game Informer’s Uncharted movie review. Watch Game Informer’s interview with Uncharted movie star, Tom Holland, after that.

It was also bloody difficult, with a punishing brutality lying beneath its serene and comforting surface - something that developer Mi-Clos Studio's founder and creative director Michaël Peiffert has been keen to address with its upcoming sequel, Out There: Oceans Of Time.

Eventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.

        <updated>2022-02-15T23:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 doesn’t premiere in theaters until April 8, but Sega and Paramount Pictures have confirmed that a third film is in the works along with TV spin-off series for Paramount+. 
In a press release, the companies revealed that development of Sonic 3 (or whatever it winds up being called) has already begun. There’s no word on who will be involved, but one would imagine the main cast will stick around along with director Jeff Fowler. Sega and Paramount did not share a release window. 
The live-action TV series features Idris Elba’s Knuckles, who makes his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and will premiere in 2023. It’s unclear if Knuckles is the star of this show or is just the first character confirmed for it but the former sounds more likely. This adds another video game series to Paramount+'s line-up alongside its soon-to-premiere Halo. To avoid potential confusion, this Sonic TV show is a separate project from Sonic Prime, the animated series that debuts on Netflix sometime this year. 
“We’ve got a remarkable partnership with Paramount, and we are excited to continue expanding the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise with them,” says Sega CEO Haruki Satomi in the press release. “2022 is shaping up to be a significant year for the franchise with the second film being released this April, as well as Sonic Frontiers, the highly anticipated video game title, coming this holiday.” 
2022 is indeed a big year for Sonic. As previously mentioned, his first open-world game Sonic Frontiers is slated to arrive later this year. You can read about how that game was originally intended to release in 2021 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A handful of popular Cities: Skylines mods have been banned from the Steam Workshop by developers Colossal Order. One, "Network Extensions 3", violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement by "discriminating against specific Steam users" blocking them from using it, Colossal Order say. Another mod, "Update From Github", aimed to circumvent the Steam Workshop entirely by allowing updates to mods to be installed directly form Github while "making changes to existing Workshop subscriptions without the user's knowledge."

Complicating matters somewhat is a sea of rumours about what else the mods contained, and a series of counter-allegations about Colossal Order from the creator of the mods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variety is reporting that Paramount Plus has a few more missions for Master Chief to go on for the streaming network. The television adaptation Halo, based on the game franchise of the same name, is getting a second season prior to the airing of its first season. 
Along with the early renewal of the series, a new showrunner is taking over for the sophomore suite of episodes. According to Variety, Brave New World creator and Fear the Walking Dead co-executive producer, David Wiener will be helming the show moving forward. He'll be taking the place of former showrunners Kyle Killen (who left partway through season one) and Steven Kane. Kane reportedly departed the project after completing the first season due to the "massive scope of the series" and the two years of production it took the first set of episodes to film due to COVID complications. 
There's no word on what kind of threats the UNSC and Master Chief will face in season two of Halo, and we likely won't know until credits roll on the debut season. Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor will reprise her role as the AI Cortana. The show also stars Bokeem Woodbine, Shabana Azmi, Bentley Kalu, Natasha Culzac, Kate Kennedy, Danny Sapani, Olive Gray, and Charlie Murphy.
Halo premieres on Paramount Plus on March 24. Check out a recent trailer for the show here, and read about some legal drama surrounding Halo that could affect the TV series.]]></summary>

First up is a collection of four Funko Pop figures featuring characters from the upcoming Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Of course, Tiny Tina herself is represented, but so is her trusty diamond unicorn, Butt Stallion. Unfortunately, it's probably not possible to have Tina ride on Butt Stallion's back. Joining that dynamic duo is the big baddie from Wonderlands, Will Arnett's Dragon Lord, along with Paladin Mike, an elite guard sworn to protect Queen Butt Stallion.

Apex Legends already has eight figurines in the Pop collection, and it looks like at least four more are being added in the near future. Slated to hit sometime this year are Wattson, Octane, Revenant, and Crypto. Given that these were the first four additions to the Apex roster, the following eight are likely to show up down the line. Or at least, anyone collecting this set would hope so.

Guardians will soon face off against Savathûn and her Lucent Brood in just one week and to prepare you for the upcoming fight, Bungie has released a new launch trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. 
As you might expect, it features plenty of new haunting imagery of the Witch Queen, plus some new threats from her. Like previous expansion launch trailers, this one is quite cinematic, featuring mostly CGI. If you’ve been paying attention to this expansion, you know Savathûn has been stealing the precious Light of the Guardians. Plus, she has a host of ally enemies that also fight using the light, representing an all-new fight for our own Guardians, who, up until this point, have never fought someone using their own powers.

Of course, Savathûn is thrilled that your Guardian and others are coming to her Throne World. In fact, she’s inviting you in. The trailer also showcases some new looks at the exotics and fancy Glaive weapons coming to Destiny 2 in The Witch Queen expansion. 
The trailer ends with a screen that showcases what you can get for preordering Destiny 2: The Witch Queen, which is the most preordered Destiny 2 expansion in the game’s history. If you preorder the deluxe edition, you’ll receive some instant in-game rewards as well as the Osteo Striga Exotic SMG (and other bonuses) when the expansion is live next week on February 22. 
While waiting for that day, read Game Informer’s preview of Destiny 2: The Witch Queen and then check out some gameplay from it in Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen New Gameplay Today. Read about how Sony and PlayStation are acquiring Destiny 2 developer, Bungie, after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.


“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”


Larian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”

Join Brian Shea as he chats with Spider-Man himself to learn everything he can about the PlayStation mascot's debut in movie theaters later this week. Mr. Holland goes into detail about his relationship with Nolan North, what his favorite Uncharted game is of all time, along with more tidbits about the upcoming film. We're even showing off some behind-the-scenes footage to spice up your viewing experience while the two gents chat about the movie.
Are you excited about the Uncharted movie? You don't have to wait long as Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's latest film arrives this Friday only in theaters. If you can't get enough of Nathan Drake and his adventures, you've come to the right place. Be sure to check out Brian Shea's review of the movie, where he says: 
"The Uncharted video games set a high bar for storytelling, and though Uncharted doesn't quite clear that bar, I had a fun time from the very first scene. Through some awe-inspiring action set pieces and strong performances, the film ably showcases the strengths of the game franchise while giving fans a new, albeit slightly familiar storyline."

Suppose you want something a bit more traditional, head over to our YouTube page to watch a fresh episode of New Gameplay Today to check out Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, where we let you know if it's worth picking up for the PlayStation 5!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has been rather successful with TV adaptations of popular video games like Castlevania and The Witcher. Now the streaming goliath's sights are set on 2K Game's gene-splicing Bioshock series, only this time, it's being developed as a movie.
The Hollywood Reporter states that Netflix is partnering with 2K's parent company Take-Two Interactive and Vertigo Entertainment to bring the series to life. The THR report calls this an effort to "develop a potential cinematic universe," which is fitting considering the multiversal events of Bioshock Infinite. Currently, there are no names attached to the project for writing or directing, nor is there any word of which era of Bioshock we'll be seeing on film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive are notoriously enthusiastic about DLC, often releasing years of expansions and add-ons for their big strategy games rather than leaping straight into sequels. So as an alternative to spending £100-odd for all a game's DLC, Paradox have started dabbling in letting players pay monthly fees to play them. The next game to start such a DLC subscription service is Hearts Of Iron IV, launching today. Like the others, it'll charge £4 per month. Or alternatively, you can still just buy DLC for keepsies.

Dune: Spice Wars is an exciting prospect for real-time strategy fans and enthusiasts of the popular books (and recent Oscar-nominated film). The game takes the series back to its RTS roots, though we hadn't seen much of it beyond cinematic teases. However, a new trailer provides the first look at its tactical gameplay.
The trailer shows off how players can command units on Arrakis. You’ll lead your chosen faction using several methods, whether it be flexing political influence, having deep economic pockets, or just pure open warfare. As you travel the world and meet/capture villages, you gather resources and set up spice harvesters to keep the money flowing while using armies to keep attackers at bay. In addition to a single-player campaign, developer Shiro Games previously confirmed multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, I made an impassioned plea for more puzzley-jigsaw games, but I did not expect my call to be answered in such a comprehensive fashion so quickly. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams, by That's Nice Games, is a jigsaw game that came to Steam last December. No, more than that. It is a doing-a-jigsaw game. A jigsaw sim.
See, most jigsaw games - and I idly toy with the idea of playing a bit of any new one I find on Steam, before realising that is a fool's errand - are just kind of 2D, put together this flat JPEG of a flower that I have cut into triangles. There's no tactile pleasure to be had. But Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams is a little one bed mezzanine flat in which you do puzzles - on the floor, on the kitchen table, on the rug - and each puzzle piece is a little 3D thing you can pick up and drop and turn around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.
We played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. 
In a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.


While it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.

You solve the daily puzzle on the pot during your morning wee, and have posted your boast to the family WhatsApp group before you even wipe (another three-solve? yawn!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite Friday's wonky launch, Lost Ark become the second-most-played game on Steam ever over the weekend. The free-to-play action-RPG hit 1.32 million peak concurrent players on Saturday, narrowly pushing it past the all-time peaks of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2. Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio behind 10 Second Ninja X have today announced a brand-new first-person stealth RPG called Abermore, a game in which you take on the role of a legendary thief and have 18 days to plan the heist of the century. It's coming to PC on March 29th, and judging by the mix of magic powers and shadow slinking I've seen from its trailer, it could be the ideal chaser for those craving another Arkane-esque immersive sim in their lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frankly I feel a bit odd writing a post that amounts to “14-year-old rendering tech works better than 20-year-old rendering tech”, but Lost Ark – 2022’s biggest surprise hit so far – has only recently come around to the benefits of DirectX 11. While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.

This tweet was sent at 2:15pm PT. Players were still experiencing issues with missing characters after downloading the new patch, however, and so servers have been taken offline "to get this resolved."
An earlier tweet from the Lost Ark account said that as compensation for the delays they "will add 3 days of Crystalline Aura to all players who log in to the game between launch and 9 AM PT [5 PM UTC] on 2/13 as a small thank you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My last Elden Ring hands-on was illuminating, to say the least. As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, "I'll come back to this later. Yeah", with that final "yeah" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.
The game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.
Power To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.
In the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.
Perhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami have announced that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel will run its first in-game event, the XYZ Festival, between the 17th and 24th of February. XYZ Festival duels will tweak the rules, limiting the cards in your Extra Deck to XYZ monsters, and offer medals to those who take part. These medals will then grant you some unannounced rewards when the event ends.
This announcement comes alongside a promise to investigate reports of cheating, as Konami say they "strive to create a safe and enjoyable gaming environment for all Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel players".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by how much Matthew made me laugh with his withering assessment of the MacGuffin in the film Red Notice being an egg, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all MacGuffin, all the time. We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can't be a coincidence that he's perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware's action-RPG Elden Ring.
That's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.

Originally released in 1999, the JRPG is coming to PC (and some consoles) as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition with new updated 3D character models, some new 2D art, a "refined" soundtrack, and other tweaky bits. It looks better than many of the garbage PC ports they were releasing a few years ago. Check out the trailer yourself below.

Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds.

Desktop monitors are trying it out as well, like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX: the very first Mini LED gaming monitor on the market when it launched late last year. As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

Tip of the iceberg. You haven’t seen his eagerness, his joie de vivre, as he swings between the many improbably-convenient floating grapple hook platforms of the world. You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab. 


By the end of my seven hours with Grapple Dog, I wanted to strangle the bastard with his own goddamn hook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games might have committed to making their Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) system more compatible with the Steam Deck, but don’t expect to see their biggest game on the Valve handheld. Battle royale money machine Fortnite will not be updated to work on the Steam Deck – and according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, that’s down to a lack of “confidence that we’d be able to combat cheating” on Linux platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A boy dancing around the streets of Paris waving a baguette over his head in BioShock Infinite holds a surprising amount of secrets and stories. Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite's Burial At Sea expansion explained why he's there. It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update! I’ve been playing around with Lost Ark’s final release version, and it runs even smoother in DirectX 11 mode than in DX9; the review build I used for initial testing was locked to the latter. The Very High preset, for instance, averaged 87fps on a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and 1080p resolution – on the DX9 review build, it averaged 73fps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In last year's hands-on with free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO Lost Ark last year, I thought it had potential if you could survive the early slow burn. Having since returned to it for a few weeks, my thoughts remain largely the same. For all its flashy combat and fun moments, the sheer grind to reach its promised endgame may prove too much for many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was sold from the moment our Justicar sliced off the mutated Apostate Preacher’s tentacle arm. The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I’ve made it,” monologues a goblin, donning chainmail and spiked shoulderpads in the changing rooms. “Finally. After all these years of hardship. After everything they told me. I will show them that even I can be the best player.”
The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death's Door is a great little game. I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.
