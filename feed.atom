But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

While there's a huge variety of gaming experiences available on Nintendo's hybrid console, there's a good chance that couch co-op games were a big part of the reason you bought it. The Switch is tailor-made for multiplayer experiences thanks to its Joy-Con controllers, which double up as two separate pads when you've got a friend nearby, even when you're out and about.

It's no secret that the Switch eShop is home to a ridiculous amount of utter slop alongside the genuinely good games, but what's baffling us is just how unwilling Nintendo seems to be to improve anything.
Just this week, we highlighted a game that blatantly copied Witch Beam's homework with Unpacking, and now it seems as though Pokémon is once again in the firing line. Specifically, following the success of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket on mobile, a new game has cropped up for pre-order on the eShop called TCG Card Shop Master.

Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Black Friday Flash Challenge 1 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the fodder challenge to earn a free pack.


This is the first of several Flash SBCs that are expected to be released by EA Sports to celebrate Black Friday. These are perfect options when it comes to getting free packs in Ultimate Team. The SBC can be completed with low-rated items, and you'll be rewarded with more packs in return. 


EA FC 25 Black Friday Flash Challenge 1 SBC solutions


The first Flash challenge has only one task, and here are its requirements. 


Task - Black Friday Flash Challenge 1 SBC 



Min. 4 Players from the same League


Max. 5 Players from the same Nation


Min. 2 Players from the same Club


Player quality: Min. Gold


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 22



The objective is to use cards that are already available in your Ultimate Team inventory. That will reduce the cost of completing the challenge. If you get stuck, you can use the solution mentioned here to unlock your rewards. 


Solution



Abdul Samed 76


Hugo Duro ST 79


Denis Suarez LM 75


Trauner 78


Gueye CM 75


Pablo Fornals RM 76


Gonzalez Pirez 75


Holes CB 76


Raul Albiol CB 79


Eric Garcia RB 78


Stanek GK 76



After completing the challenge, you'll get a 81+ Combo Upgrade Pack. This pack contains two player items - one card will be rated 81 or higher, while the second one will be rated 77 or higher. Both cards are eligible to be a walkout/promo item, so it makes complete sense to finish this SBC before it expires. 


We will also have more solutions once EA Sports releases more SBCs later in the day.

For many years it's been slim pickings for Star Trek games on Nintendo systems, and while we've got our fingers crossed that Star Trek: Resurgence will get ported sooner rather than later, Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova — a solid co-op adventure from Tessera Studios — has been the only game to go boldly on Switch. Oh, and the TNG table in Pinball FX.
However, according to an eShop listing, Santa is bringing Trek fans a little present on 25th December in the form of Star Trek: Legends. Santa, or publisher Qubic Games - one of the two. Keen fans may recognise the title as Emerald City Games' "strategy-based RPG" launched on Apple Arcade back in 2021 and recently got a Steam release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in Selaco. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

They give you several very powerful skills that let you create chances from nothing and finish from seemingly impossible angles.

Styles




S
Nagi, King


A
Bachira, Isagi


B
Chigiri






Nagi and King, even though very different, are the best styles on the attack in Blue Lock: Rivals. Nagi's mid-air trap is so good that even without the B skill at the moment, the style feels OP. King has a lot of mobility and a very good long-shot potential.


For defense, Bachira takes the cake because of its steal skill and the nutmeg move that let…]]></summary>

Back in 2014, IGN, like many outlets, shared its review of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. While the vast majority showered the 3DS remakes with praise, IGN was slightly more critical, awarding them a 7.8/10 and noting that they have "too much water" (among other criticisms, naturally).
In case you haven't seen it memed to oblivion in the years since, it's fair to say that the water comment has become something of a running joke among the Pokémon community, with The Pokémon Company itself even referencing it in a tweet earlier this year.

Thankfully, I managed to solve the puzzle with a trial-and-error approach, so I can tell you how you can unlock the door to access the rest of the house.

That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

This comes via Otaku Soken (thanks, Automaton) and is based on responses from 5,476 university students across Japan. Nintendo is the highest company from the entertainment sector, and is only beat by trade firm Itochu at number one and biotech corporation Ajinomoto at number two.

Pumpkin Soup Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create Pumpkin Soup, you'll need to find the following ingredients, and thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC like The Storybook Vale: 



Pumpkin


Ginger


Any vegetable


Milk

Pumpkin Seeds or, if you're lucky, the squash vegetable itself can be bought from Goofy's Stall in the Forgotten Lands. The seeds are 275 Star Coins, while the vegetable is 996 Star Coins. By the way, if you plant many Pumpkins, they are a great way of making money as there's a lot of profit in selling these to Goofy. 


Ginger can also be found in the Forgotten Lands. This time, it doesn't require your wallet. Look to the ground, and you'll find the ingredient planted in the ground. Look for a long green stalk poking out of the ground. Pick up the crop.


Milk can be bought at Chez Remy for 230 Star Coins. You'll need to finish the quests from the Ratatouille realm to unlock the restaurant. You can find the realm in the castle. For the vegetable, you can use another Pumpkin or grow a crop that grows quickly like a Carrot from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. 


Once you have all four ingredients, go to a cooking station like your house or Chez Remy. Throw all of them into the pot, and you'll have a lovely Pumpkin Soup in your possession. You can sell it for around 1,461 Star Coins (depending on the vegetable you choose) and eat the dish for 1,591 Energy. If you have the Storybook Vale DLC, you can also make Stuffed Ring Squash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Blue Star Lily in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a pretty flower you can pick up in one of the original locations of the game. It can help you make several blue-themed items like the Blue Retro Portable Radio and others. 


Blue Star Lily Disney Dreamlight Valley Location


You can find a Blue Star Lily from the original valley within the Forest of Valor. Thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC like The Storybook Vale. 


Screenshots by Destructoid


Run around the Forest of Valor (you can also find Emeralds here) and look for a blue flower growing from the grass. You don't want the bell-shaped flowers; the Blue Star Lilies have normal petals. 


You'll be able to find around three or four of the flowers at one time. One respawns every 30 minutes, so it will take some time to craft the items you need, unfortunately. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


What can you craft with this flower?


One cute item you can make with the Blue Star Lily is a Blue Retro Portable Radio. You'll get the instructions on how to create it after picking up a Blue Star Lily. Collect the following materials and then head to a crafting table at your home or at Scrooge's shop. 



1 Blue Lily


5 Softwood


1 Iron Ingot



You can also craft Iron Ingot by collecting five Iron Ores and one Coal Ore, which you can get from mining nearby rocks. Once you have the Blue Retro Portable Radio made, you can place it as furniture inside your home. It will put on some familiar music if you interact with it.

It's not perfect by any means, but it's remarkable how much it feels like I'm playing Destiny on my phone.

It's not in any position to take me away from Destiny 2 proper, but it provides a quick Destiny fix and plays well enough that I'm willing to overlook some of the more annoying aspects of mobile games.


Destiny: Rising presents a respectable slice of Destiny 2's spirit on mobile, even making a few surprising improvements in some areas.

A new patent from South Korean tech giant Samsung suggests that the company may be tinkering with a potential handheld gaming console.
That's not all, though. The patent suggests that such a device may follow in the footsteps of the company's Z Flip and Fold phone lines and boast its own foldable screen. As reported by 91Mobiles (thanks, Tom's Guide), the patent was registered earlier this month via the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), showcasing some pretty clear cut images of a device that closely resembles the Switch in design, but with a few obvious differences.

This is the latest fodder challenge to be released in Ultimate Team, and you can complete it for cheap. You should have most of the cards required. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge without spending too many coins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld, or, like many call it, Pokémon with guns — or even Pokémon but cruel — is getting a massive new update. Pocketpair is teasing a new area six times larger than Sakurajima that will come packed to the brim with exciting new stuff.


The studio says the new update will also feature new Pals, trainers to fight against, new bosses, and will serve as a new high-difficulty challenge for fans of the original experience. The update will roll out sometime in December, with more details pending soon.


Palworld has recently also announced a huge Terraria crossover, which we also don't know much about. Pocketpair merely released a photo of a character from Palworld shaking hands with Terraria's main guy. Will we see Palworld make the jump to 2d? Will we get to dig and build incredibly intricate torture, I mean, productivity devices in Palworld? Pocketpair promises more details will emerge soon on that one as well. 




Though we're yet to see any concrete details regarding either big update, the announcements at least prove the surprise mega-hit is far from dead. And it really needs to show its teeth, as Pocketpair is still preparing for a tough copyright battle with Nintendo over the similarities between Palworld and I'll let you guess what.


Nintendo is accusing Pocketpair of, among other patent infringements, stealing the concept of throwing a ball to capture wild creatures. Palworld sure does feature that, but Pocketpair has already stated that the studio will fight the lawsuit.


You can currently get Palworld for 25% off as part of Steam's Autumn sale, so this might be a great time to check it out and pick your side in the big copyright war of our times.

Nintendo Switch Beginner's Guide - Which system should you get?


There are three different systems to consider while buying a Nintendo Switch: the Nintendo Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED. The regular Nintendo Switch was the first to launch and can be taken on-the-go or be played as a regular console on your TV. The Nintendo Switch Lite can't be played on the TV and can only be played portable. The Switch OLED is the premium option with a better, bigger 7' inch OLED screen.

The Switch eShop is full of a lot of rubbish these days, that's no surprise to us. The rise of 'scam games' has been a quick one, with results ranging from keyword bingo titles like Cop Car Police Simulator Chase - Car games simulator & driving to more blatant rip-offs. Today, one that straddles both camps has been brought to our attention.
As flagged on BlueSky by Daniel Vuckovic, the eShop is now home to a title called 'Unpacking: Deluxe Edition'. Now, you may reasonably assume this is some kind of expansion to 2021's indie darling, Unpacking, but you would be wrong. Instead, this 'Deluxe Edition' just adopts Witch Beam's instantly recognisable name. And its basic format. Ugh.

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

So here we all are, waiting. For all the rumours — all the supposed prototype casings and talk of electromagnets and back buttons — the only things we can say for certain about 'Switch 2' are that it'll be revealed sometime in the next 123 days (before the end of the fiscal year on 31st March 2025) and that it's backwards compatible with current Switch software.
Not a whole lot to go on, but that backwards compatibility nugget essentially confirms that the new console's form factor has to be a touchscreen tablet with detachable controllers. No doughnut screens, no pyramids that project holograms - as expected, Nintendo is sensibly sticking with what works and plans to deliver 'another' Switch.

It featured some predictable hits but then flanked them with some hilariously dreadful games, or, as I put it in that review, “bad in an almost impressive way.” So, I’ve been looking forward to Taito Milestones 3 for another injection of titles.


This collection is dominated by a coalition of the Bubble Bobble and Rastan series. But, like before, there is also a smattering of more obscure titles. However, this time around, I wouldn’t say any of them are “impressively bad.” But rather than just talk about them vaguely in the preamble, I’m going to take the approach I’ve started doing with arcade collections, and I’m just going to do a short review of every game in the collection. There are 10, so brace yourself.

Developed by one of Tencent's subsidiaries, Polaris Quest, Light of Motiram admittedly looks like an impressive and ambitious 3D open-world adventure and the enemy designs of its "Mechanimals" are quite interesting. It has clearly taken a lot of inspiration from the Horizon series.

Shot strength is essential in games like LOCKED and Skillful.

A lot of other companies were touting their fancy 32-bit monstrosities, and Nintendo needed something to convince people that they were still on the cutting edge. Otherwise, they might turn to Phillips, Atari, or 3DO to satiate their need for extra bits.

I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surge is a legendary brawler in Brawl Stars who was first available through the Brawl Pass in Season 2: Summer of Monsters. His main attack is to shoot a juice projectile that splits when it hits enemies. 


What’s even better is that his Super lets him leap over walls, deal damage, knock back enemies, and upgrade his attacks and movement. With his Hypercharge, he even gets a fourth-stage upgrade that makes his shots stronger and split more often.


However, like any other brawler, he also needs some enhancement in the form of a gadget, a star power, and gears. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on the best build of Surge in Brawl Stars.


Best build for Surge in Brawl Stars


Screenshot by Destructoid



Gadget: Power Surge


Star Power: To the Max!


Gear 1: Speed


Gear 2: Damage



Starting with the gadget, you can use the “Power Surge” as it increases the Surge’s Stage by one for ten seconds. However, there is a downside: Surge cannot use this gadget if he is at stage three. 


In terms of star power, you should try on “To the Max!” as his main attack will now be split into two halves if it crosses any obstacles like walls. What’s even better is that it will split into six halves if you are in stage three.


You can use speed and damage gear, which will make Surge an absolute beast. Once you equip the speed gear, Surge will move 15% faster in bushes, as he is an easy target for any throwers in Brawl Stars. 


With the damage gear, Surge will deal 15% more when his hit points are less than half. However, you can only inflict extra damage on the enemy brawlers, not any spawnable objects like Nita’s bear. So it is advised not to use this gear around them and wait for the right time to unleash your attacks.

Each tier for the Pokemon is determined by their effectiveness in battle. The difficulty of playing the Pokemon doesn't come into the equation - if you're good enough, you can make the S Tier Pokemon on these lists work.

Back in 2019, developer Phoenix Labs boarded the Monster Hunter train with its free-to-play take on Capcom's beast-slaying formula. The result was Dauntless, an online RPG with a decent gameplay loop, but one that really chugged on Switch.
In the years since, Dauntless had somewhat slipped from our minds (2019 feels like an age ago, after all), but next month, Phoenix Labs are introducing a monster update, serving as "a major overhaul of the game".

The field hospital is gone, probably blown to pieces. Troops keep wandering north and disappearing from view, only to come flying back as airborne cadavers moments later. The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision. If the Colonial forces want to win the persistent online war of Foxhole, suggests the sergeant with his many irritated noises, then someone needs to piece these dying fools together.

It also adds a touch of realism to restaurants and homes, allowing you to put actual food on the table so that an environment looks a lot less sterile. 


Also, each recipe you unlock comes with an actual recipe you can follow in the real world to create the dish. As someone who loves cooking, that’s a massive perk.

Cooperative play in Rita's Rewind will be limited for the game on all platforms at launch, and the Switch version has been delayed by over two weeks.


Dan Amrich, the content editor at developer Digital Eclipse, announced the news on November 27. Amrich writes that "technical issues" will keep online co-op to two players only for PlayStation and Steam users. Folks on Xbox and Switch will be stuck with couch co-op until the feature is enabled "within a few weeks." Amrich also revealed that "unforeseen circumstances" will move the Switch version of the game to December 19.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CP is one of the easiest resources to earn in UFL, but it's also the most important item you'll need to improve your squad in the latest football game.


Unlike other titles like eFootball 2025 and EA FC 25, UFL doesn't have a gacha for unlocking footballers. There's no trading or auction market, and you have to buy cards directly. For that, you'll need RP and CP. Let's take a look at how you can get more in-game currency.


How to get more CP in UFL


The easiest way to get CP is by playing in the Ranked Mode. Every game you complete will help you earn CP, and the rate will double if you've activated Premium. The return will increase further if you're using a CP boost. At the time of writing, no other game mode will help you get this resource.


Another great way to get CP is by selling cards that you won't need. Your squad will have limited slots, and you can't have an unlimited number of cards. Instead of expanding the total slots, it's better to release the cards that you no longer need. This will also help you get RP, which is needed to sign new players.

The Star Pass is currently available at the launch of early access. It's very easy to activate the Premium track, which has better rewards. Some of these rewards will grant you CP boosters, which will fetch you more resources whenever you're completing a match in a competitive mode.


Completing daily objectives is key. As of writing, weekly objectives aren't available, but completing the daily tasks will help you get SP, LP, and CP. All three items are vital if you want to quickly improve your squad.


UFL might be a free game, but you can spend real-life money to buy CP directly from the shop. You can't buy RP directly, so spend accordingly and try to even out your expenses to build your squad in a balanced fashion.

Square Enix's latest pulled in an additional 91,362 copies between Switch and PS5 this week, which is far from its debut's 821,770 total, but it's still enough to keep the Nintendo version in pole position. Meanwhile, the PS5 edition slips to third after another strong week from Super Mario Party Jamboree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game.

CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One's interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.

Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we're all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner.

Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all.

"Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"

Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you're talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn't really matter, because you don't have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

"I won’t", I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mutant enemies in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

Not for me the thrill of flushing out the true culprit (or culprits???) between visits to the exquisitely upholstered dining car, against the backdrop of passing mountains. The best I can hope for is getting chewed out for hogging the toilet on a crowded commuter train to Leeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

"God-touched", in this case, means "fungal and a bit mermaidy". It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

Now, you too can live this magic: there's a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It's nice!

Buggier than Kafka's Metamorphosis. In our S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review, wasteland wanderer James called it "easily the most borked FPS I've played in years", detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly.

Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.
Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re probably all past "And in the game" jokes by now, but it is fitting that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is about venturing into a shattered world and enduring the worst of its logic-defying hardships to find the treasures within. This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading "DANGER: BUGS".

First came Longdue, a conspicuously corporate operator who are making an untitled “psychogeographic RPG”. Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, "there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use," the hacker predicted.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: "I hope this hurts."

With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let's take a closer look at how things play out.

Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it'll devour as you play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: "ah, that was good."
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn't even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

I hope one day to level up from "bumbling, tumbling and blundering" to "running and jumping". Perhaps I'll even get as far as "speedrunning". But in the likely event that I plateau at "blundering", it's a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha "prelude": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

As sports rightsholders claim the fraudulent access cost them €42 million, in piracy circles the shutdown is being linked to a change of policy at Telegram. A direct warning that personal details could be handed over by Telegram coincides with some piracy groups abandoning the platform.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A "nevíme jak" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.
