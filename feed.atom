Astarion has one distinct advantage as a Rogue over other Baldur's Gate 3 characters. Whether you're playing as him or bringing him along as a companion, Astarion can choose up to four feats as he levels up, while others only get three. These feats come at Levels 4, 8, 10, and 12 for Rogues.


But which ones should you be taking for your playthrough? We're going to take a look at the best feats for Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, to make sure you get your Rogue build just right.

Every major Doom game has been released on the Switch and following last year's confirmation the new entry would be a multiplatform release, it seems like there's a real chance the next chapter could show up on the Switch 2 at some point.
With this in mind, it seems the official release date for DOOM: The Dark Ages has now seemingly leaked - revealing it will launch on Xbox Series X|S in the middle of May 2025, with other platforms likely to line up with this date. This information was accidentally shared by Gamekult ahead of Xbox's Developer Direct this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Confirmed for March 2027.
We're just one day away from the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie — which introduces Shadow the Hedgehog to the blockbuster franchise — hitting cinemas worldwide. But Variety is reporting that Paramount Pictures has already greenlighted a fourth film.
Shocked? Nope, not us. According to the report, the movie is aiming for a Spring 2027 release. We know nothing else yet, but given that director Jeff Fowler has stuck around for the first three movies, we wouldn't be surprised if he's also on board for a fourth run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Defense Tech event is now live in Toilet Tower Defense, and it's a fun way of obtaining various rewards by solving a puzzle.


In this case, you'll need to find the locations of nine circuits, which will complete the collection and unlock the rewards. Without further delay, let's take a look at how you can find all the circuits in the Defense Tech event.


How to find the Circuits in Toilet Tower Defense Tech event


All nine Circuit boards are located around the Tech City event world. Thankfully, they're pretty easy to spot despite them having different locations. You'll be looking for bright green boards at various spots. Of course, you might have encountered some of them as they're not exactly hidden. If you're yet to complete the collection, here are the locations of all nine boards.



The first three boards are located inside the play area. The first of the three is at the enemy spawn portal, while the second will be at the center of the arena. The third one is slightly hidden behind a rock formation.


The fourth one is right behind the portal, which lets you access the Toilet Fortress.


The fifth one can be found behind the Ranked mode board, near the Apocalypse city map.


To get the sixth board, go to the Summon Unit area. You'll find the board next to a wooden block.


The seventh one can be collected from the Trading Plaza. Go to the archway on the left, and you'll find the board next to a pillar.


The eighth one is also located at the Trading Plaza, adjacent to a wooden statue at the far end of the location.


The final one will require you to visit a statue in the water at Trading Plaza. The Circuit board will be located at the top of the statue.





Collecting all nine Circuit boards in the Defense Tech event will help you get 1,000 XP and 500 Batteries.

Where to find the Colossal Worm


You can dig up the Colossal Worm on the Badlands island during the server-wide Colossal Worm event. The Colossal Worm event is completely random but has a 17% chance of triggering and starting each day in Dig It. Players can also manually spawn the Colossal Worm event by speaking to the NPC Gandolf at Nookville and spawning it manually with Robux.


Once the event is active, head to the desert Badlands island and you will see a large yellow circle around The Pit in the middle of the Badlands. As long as you a…]]></summary>

If you don't know exactly which instance of Musk being annoying on the Internet I'm talking about, let me give you a refresher. A couple of months ago, a very tiny but disproportionately vocal part of the Internet began raving about very busy billionaire Elon Musk being the top-ranked Diablo 4 player in the world.

Now, Havok may be clawing its way back into the limelight.


To be perfectly clear, it's not like Havok's gone anywhere in the time since: the video games' focus on physics-driven gameplay and activities has simply shrunken down into irrelevance. Havok is a very particular kind of middleware that's been designed from the ground up specifically and only to handle video game physics, and this feature has been de-emphasized to the point of mere neatness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judero developers Talha and Jack Co have announced that the Kickstarter (not live yet) for Mashina will start tomorrow, January 22, 2025. Along with the announcement is a new trailer, as well as the estimated release date of June, 2025.


The Kickstarter is intended to raise funds to finish the last stretch of development, as it seems Mashina is well on the way, judging by the trailer. The campaign is aiming to raise £12000. The game was announced with a teaser this past December, but the Kickstarter and gameplay trailer paint a much clearer picture.




You play as the titular character who has a penchant for digging. They’re stranded on an island with a handful of locals that you’ll get intimately familiar with. Digging allows you to gather resources, as well as things to decorate the island and gift to the other characters. Beyond just directly getting your hands dirty, you can also construct machines to help with your work. Looks cozy.


Like Judero, all of the assets in Machina are hand-sculpted. Apparently, if you pledge £500, you’ll get one of the handmade robots. I had the chance to interview one of the developers, Jack King-Spooner, for the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter’s monthly special this month. He tells me that clay getting stuck under fingernails. As to what his strategy is. “To prevent under-nail clay I use a collection of ornate porcelain thimbles.” Incredible. I only ask the tough questions.


I also reviewed Judero back in September. It’s fantastic. I don’t exactly get it, but I can dig those vibes. There’s nothing out there quite like it, and it’s something you have to experience. I think I can grok Mashina a little better, barring any massive curveballs that might be thrown.


The Kickstarter for Mashina starts tomorrow, January 22, 2025. It’s release is planned for PC sometimes in June 2025.

Citizen Sleeper was, coincidentally, one of 2022's sleeper hits. With its combination of top-tier writing and decision-based gameplay, this table-top-inspired RPG and space adventure pulled us into its airlock and wouldn't let us out until we had played through the emotional damage of witnessing every possible outcome (and yes, that includes the three DLC packs).
It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 PC Gaming Showcase, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.

“With 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico on the way, I can see a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US, as much of that production infrastructure is in Mexico,” Piscatella states. “If they do get made, I expect higher prices both phys & dig.”


Further to this, he suggests that the MSRP on digital games may also increase in an attempt to keep parity with physical releases.

The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.

I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

Last week, Nintendo gave us our first official look at Switch 2 and threw in a '2025' release window for good measure. While the House of Mario is yet to be more specific with its release date, publisher and accessory manufacturer Nacon has shared some narrower expectations (thanks, VGC).
As noted on Twitter by industry analyst @MauroNL3, Nacon commented on the Switch 2 release date in its recent financial earnings report, noting that it expects Nintendo's next console to launch "in the first half of 2025/26" — or some point between April and September 2025, for those frantically trying to remember when the fiscal year starts (don't worry, we were too).

The Bozjan Southern Front and Zadnor are among the most fleshed out, with full quest lines and endless hours' worth of gameplay in the two instanced large-scale battle zones. 


While you’re exploring and taking part in skirmishes, critical engagements, and the two dedicated dungeons for the zones, you’ll likely end up accumulating Field Records. These provide information about characters specific to the zone, and while some will fall into your pockets like candy on Halloween, some are incredibly difficult to get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime Vanguards 3.0 update went live earlier during the weekend, and it has introduced something called Gift Boxes and Presents.


These items can be obtained by grinding missions inside the game. However, you can take steps to increase your chances of success and the rate you get the Gift Boxes in Anime Vanguards.


How to get Gift Boxes and Presents in Anime Vanguards


To begin the process, you'll want to open a Winter Portal (can be purchased with Gems). While you can earn Gift Boxes from different ones, go for the ones that take place on Planet Namak. This is the easiest way to obtain Presents, and dealing with the enemies will be easier. This is applicable irrespective of the tier of your stage.


The next step is to complete the Winter Portal, which will guarantee another portal (if you successfully manage to clear it). These portals begin from Tier 1 and go all the way up to Tier 10. If you clear a Tier 10 Portal, you'll only get a Tier 9/Tier 10 Portal in return. Hence, the event gets better the more you play the game.


Exclusive units are also recommended, as they have better in-game stats and abilities, making it easier for you to end the enemies. This is more important if you're trying to clear the high-tier portals.


Do note that a Gift Box isn't guaranteed even if you manage to complete a portal.

How to use Presents in Anime Vanguards


There are two main ways to use Presents that you get. The Presents are a separate currency used at the Event NPC to get different items (located in the Quest area). However, a better use for this currency is to use it on the Winter Event limited banner. Some fantastic characters are present on this banner, and the only way to open this is by using the Gift Boxes.


Hence, it's the best time to get grinding in Anime Vanguards and earn as many Gift Boxes and Presents as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Production on Nintendo and Sony's live-action Legend of Zelda film is presumably ticking away behind closed doors, but in the meantime, a group of fans are undertaking the challenge of bringing Hyrule to life themselves.
Above, you'll find the first teaser trailer for 'Lost in Hyrule', an upcoming live-action fan film which has just opened its doors to Rupee donations on Kickstarter (or other, non-Hylian currencies, if you'd rather). According to the campaign page, the story takes place after the events of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, offering the filmmaker's take on "the untold conclusion to the Hero of Time’s saga". Mmm, lore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can unlock eleven different mounts in Dig It, and they can be equipped when you're on a piece of land.


There are different ways to get these mounts, including microtransactions. Additionally, you can only equip one mount at a given time, but having more in your collection will help you to change between them.


How to obtain all mounts in Dig It


Mount Name
Rarity
How to obtain




Baby Yeti
Legendary
Get every diggable item in the Permafrost region. This mount can take a lot of time to unlock, and you may have to use Mythical Magnets to help your cause. 


Biodegradable Boots
Legendary
This mount is easy to obtain, but you'll have to spend 80 Robux, as it's a Starter Pack exclusive. 


Elf
Legendary
This mount is no longer available, as it was exclusively part of the Gift of Elves event in 2024. 


Flexy
Legendary
Another mount that requires you to spend Robux, as it can obtained by buying the Early Supporter Game Pass. 


Mini Car
Legendary
Like Baby Yeti, you can obtain this mount by finding all the diggable items in the Badlands region


Piggy Bank
Rare
This mount can be obtained from Benson's Salary Rewards


Pinata
Legendary
You'll have to find all diggable items from the Lunar Cloud location


Rolling Cannon
Legendary
You'll have to find all diggable items from the Piratesburg location


Sisyphys
Legendary
You'll have to get all diggable items from the Greek Temple location


Snitchy
Legendary
You'll have to obtain it from the Gamepass by spending 499 Robux


Supa Fly Shoes
Legendary
You'll have to get all diggable items from the Nookville location






It's not necessary to have a mount, as they are mostly cosmetic in nature. Focusing on your Shovel is going to be far more fruitful if you're looking to find the most valuable loot available in Dig It. There's also a chance for the developers to add new mounts in the future, as fresh updates are released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Miracle Growth Elixir in Disney Dreamlight Valley lives up to its name as it instantly grows vegetables like Pumpkins and Lettuce. Thankfully, it's fairly easy to make by finding Vitalys Crystals and more from the game. 


Miracle Growth Elixir Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To create the awesome Miracle Growth Elixir in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need the following ingredients:



10 Vitalys Crystals


10 Rich Soil


500 Dreamlight



Vitalys Crystals are found within a cave around the Sunlit Plateau called the Vitalys Mine. Look for the waterfall near a stone bridge to find it. You'll first want a companion with you, who has the Mining specialty, so the process becomes faster. Mine at the rocks that have a blue streak to them. Hit them with the pickaxe, and you have a good chance to get a Vitalys Crystal. Having a companion with you gives a chance of getting another Vitalys Crystal.

Rich Soil is gained by digging up the soil at any location, especially within the Plaza. This is a random drop. Having a digging specialty companion with you may help with the process too. 


Dreamlight is gathered by completing quests and finishing Duties like taking a picture or collecting enough apples. You can check your objectives on the menu. It's under the first section "Dreamlight." You can also craft Dreamlight with Dream Shards.


How to use this elixir


Once you have all of the ingredients, go to any crafting station near your house or in Scrooge's store. You can find the Miracle Growth Elixir from the list of options.

Make sure to pick the correct potion. Once it's made, use it from your inventory menu. Then, equip the water can. Spray it on the crops you want to see grow instantly. You only have a few limited uses so pick your crops wisely.

Though Nintendo is yet to confirm it, more and more signs caught by TheGamer and fans on Reddit point to the likelihood of it being the case.


Tech leaks are a dubious thing, and console leaks, especially, are to be taken with a heavy pinch of salt. This, however, is coming from NextHandheld, a leaker who'd talked about the Nintendo Switch and who's been proven right on every claim, so fans are now digging deeper into this very promising possibility.

We've seemingly had our very first look at Mario Kart 9 during the Switch 2 reveal trailer, and one thing you might have noticed is the similar but slightly different-looking character designs.
Perhaps the highlight is Donkey Kong's new look, which has been labelled a "redesign" by some. It's been a bit of a talking point within the DK and Super Mario fandom, and now we've actually got a response from the artist who was behind DK's modern (and arguably most iconic) look - former Rare and Donkey Kong Country veteran, Kevin Bayliss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold has announced that I Am Your Beast is getting one least content update. Titled Cold Sweat, it will include “New Levels. No Story. Just CHALLENGE.” It hits January 23, 2025.


I Am Your Beast describes itself as "he's-in-the-walls" fantasy, and that’s a pretty effective way of describing its over-the-top power fantasy bent. It’s all about always moving while shooting, throwing, and stomping. Certain stages have different objectives, such as hacking laptops, but largely, you’re trying to just take out everyone wearing camo.




I reviewed it back at launch, and what really struck me about it was how readable it was the whole time. Despite all the chaos, you can easily tell what’s going on at any time. Every target, every attack, and every hit is well communicated, which enables you to pull off incredible feats of agility. I had some issues with the storytelling, but the game itself is butter.


Not much has been said about the update aside from what you need to know in general. It’s a challenging new set of levels, though from the original (now deleted) post, there doesn’t seemt o be a new narrative to connect them all, which makes it a bit different than the last one which put the new content in a neat little narrative package centered around survivors of the protagonist’s rampage.


I Am Your Beast is out now on PC. The Cold Sweat content update is out on January 23, 2025.

Ahhh, there's nothing like taking a detour in a video game. From sprawling open-world games to turn-based RPGs, sidequests are an almost essential part of the adventure. After all, can you really say you've saved the world or uncovered the secrets of your friends if you haven't collected all of the magical coins or you haven't helped the village mayor pay off a debt?
As we're approaching the end of the Switch's life, at Nintendo Life, we've been pondering all of our favourite sidequests we've experienced (or re-experienced) on the lovely little hybrid console. And there's no shortage of those optional yet magical expeditions.

There was once a time when Banjo-Kazooie was rightly considered to be a close rival to the Super Mario franchise when Rare launched two outstanding entries on N64 in the form of the self-titled debut and its sequel, Banjo-Tooie.
That was a long time ago, though. While Microsoft flirted with idea of growing the franchise in 2008 with the rather divisive Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, the publisher hasn't touched it in the years since. According to Moon Studios' (Ori and the Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps) CEO Thomas Mahler on social media, however, this was perhaps the wrong move, and Microsoft may well be sitting on something that could, with the right treatment, rival 3D Mario games on modern consoles (thanks, Pure Xbox):

The Hollow Knight: Silksong community has been ablaze in recent weeks with theories and rumours aplenty about when the hotly-anticipated sequel will finally release. While none are yet to come to fruition, Team Cherry has provided a tiny development update, just to reassure everyone that the game actually does exist and it "will release" one day.
Last week, Hollow Knight co-creator William Pellen updated his Twitter profile picture to an image of a cake. For most fan bases, this wouldn't be enough to bat an eyelid, but when you've been waiting this many years for news from Hallownest, every change matters. The TL;DR of it is that fans traced this image back to an online recipe dated to 2nd April (the day of the Switch 2 Direct), and made the logical leap that this will be a big day for Silksong news.

Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from mp1st.
News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

Last week saw the Wii's Donkey Kong Country Returns return in HD on Switch. Following the first time it returned on 3DS, the Switch port — helmed by Forever Entertainment this time, with the original devs at Retro getting only a cursory nod in the credits this time — brought the levels of the 2013 3DS port to the big screen in high-def with a modest dusting of tweaks.
We liked DKC Returns HD, awarding it a 7/10 in our review, but felt that a classic like this deserved a little bit more care and attention — the 'Deluxe' treatment, if you will — especially given the price point.

The launch price for the Nintendo Switch 2 is, at the time of writing, unknown and will likely remain that way until Nintendo's big Direct presentation in April.
However, according to Circana (NPD) analyst Mat Piscatella, the eventual price of the console likely won't matter for the early adopters amongst us. In speaking with GamesRadar+, he stated that as long as the cost of the machine isn't "egregious", then it will likely sell.

Last year, EA dropped the MySims Cozy Bundle on Switch and it was... fine. But, as anyone familiar with the Sims spin-off series will likely know, there's more to MySims than the original and its Kingdom sequel. Might these receive a revival one day, too? Uhh, maybe?
Over the weekend, Reddit user OyeDiego took to the r/MySims group to report that two new MySims bundles were briefly listed on the EA App before being swiftly removed (thanks for the heads up, Eurogamer). Titled 'MySims Action Bundle' and 'MySims Beacon Bay', the Redditor claims that neither page had any pictures or game information, but they were home to a PEGI 7 age rating and a placeholder date of 2099.

Presenting: New Viscous n' Delicious Mawflakes! The ultimate cosmic breakfast cereal, available in all the colours of the rainbow plus 666 others that aren't fit for human eyes! Simply pour over molten ichor and leave to stand - you'll know they're ready to eat when you can no longer hear yourself weeping. "Ready to eat" is a phrase that cuts two ways, of course - and what better way to accompany being eaten by Mawflakes than by reading about this week's new PC games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero felt a bit content-lite when it launched last year. Its first DLC pack will remedy some of that. Bandai Namco revealed that 11 new playable characters will join the arena fighter later this month, including all forms of Gohan and Piccolo from the most recent Dragon Ball film, Super Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Cherry's long-awaited metroidvania Hollow Knight: Silksong will be re-revealed in April, if you believe a bunch of frantic reddit posts about cake. The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

It’s a bigger, presumably more powerful version of the beloved console/handheld hybrid that has magnetic Joy-Cons and can play your old Switch games, too. That might not sound that…

The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.

And while it’s coming to console with bindings for controllers, a mouse will still be many people’s preferred way to play. What if the Switch 2 Joy-Con can also double as PC gaming mice?

Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the real best gaming handheld of 2025, the Steam Deck.
I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the Steam Deck OLED, that one’s better.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

Team Fortune's lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a "violent crime", following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

An official statement published this week reveals that between 2021 and November 2024, a total of 3,682 pirate sites were blocked to prevent exploitation of local content. Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In its annual report published last week, the U.S. Government listed MagisTV as one of the most notorious piracy services. The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often get sent so many games from publishers and developers that we simply don't have the time or capacity to play. But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.
Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

Unfortunately, those two books both said the same thing, meaning I had to check four more. If anyone knows what every book ever written says on the subject, do let me know. I'm trapped now.

Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

Felipe Pepe wrote about the gentrification of video game history, arguing that American video game history overwrites more local experiences. "We’re not all suburban kids who got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

You know what I'm talking about. You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we've had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years.

One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I sometimes joke about it, but it's like I need a war to start a new game," Rasheed Abu-Eideh tells me over a call. "The specific thing that made me make Liyla And The Shadows Of War is the attacks on Gaza in 2014, and the specific thing that made me make Dreams On A Pillow is the attacks on Gaza in 2023."
Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access back in 2016.

If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who believes in the ideal of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new Lenovo Legion Go on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
