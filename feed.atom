        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newest season of Fortnite changed up the locations of all the Shadow Briefings, which have become a crucial part of the shooter. You're able to take on challenges to earn bonus XP and rewards for completing the Shadow Briefing mission in time. Here's where you can find all of the Fortnite Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4.





Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4


In Chapter 5 Season 4, there are 26 total Shadow Briefing spawn locations in Fortnite. It's important to keep in mind that the Shadow Briefing terminal won't spawn at all of these locations each match. Instead, a handful of these locations, typically about 10, will spawn the Shadow Briefing terminals, in a rotation that randomizes each time. It's typically helpful to keep the map up so each match you can look in nearby areas until you learn where they can all spawn. Here are all the Fortnite Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4:



Northeast of Rebel's Roost


Catcher's Cove


Doom's Courtyard


Latverian Station


Castle Doom


The Ol' Mill


Doomstadt


Grim Gate


North of Charon's Crossing


Restored REels


Reckless Railways


Grand Glacier


Dumpenhausen


The Raft


Southeast of The Raft


Coastal Columns


Ship It! Station


Sandy Strip


Nitrodome


The Wreckmill


Pantheon Path


Southwest of Pantheon Path


Brawler's Battleground


Research Rock



You can also check the map above to see all the locations as is indicated by the yellow X's. There are several quests tied to the locations of the Shadow Briefings, so make sure you do them before the locations once again change with the start of the new season. They are typically scattered across the map, so usually, you can find one in close proximity regardless of where you drop, but because of the randomization that's never guaranteed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy playing Wuthering Waves and happen to have Discord installed on your PC, which I’d guess most of you do, then you might want to take advantage of this quest. 


Between now and September 9, Discord and Kuro Game Studio are giving 300,000 players the opportunity to get their hands on in-game items, including a Morphable Echo, simply for streaming themselves playing Wuthering Waves for a relatively short 15 minutes. 


As well as the Morphable Echo, which will provide you with echoes in-game when used, but also the following valuable resources to spend or use in Wuthering Waves as you see fit:



15,000 Shell Credits


2 Advanced Resonance Potions


2 Advanced Energy Cores



It doesn’t matter where you stream the game in Discord -- you can choose to share your gameplay with an entire server or simply just one friend -- but you should open and load the game before accepting the quest in the client. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Once you’ve streamed for 15 minutes, you’ll receive a redemption code, which you can find by heading to the Discover page (right at the bottom of your list of servers by default) and then selecting ‘Quests’. Select which server you play Wuthering Waves on, and then follow the following steps in-game to claim your rewards:


Settings > Other > Redemption Code


Once you’ve entered the code, your rewards will be sent via in-game mail. Make sure to redeem your codes before the event ends on September 9, or you’ll lose out on the rewards!

If you’re planning to play on console, then you needn’t worry about the specifications set out below. However, if you’re going to be purchasing and playing through Steam, then here’s everything you need to know about both the minimum and recommended requirements for PC.

Minimum:


Operating System: Windows 10 64-bit


Processor: Intel Core i7-4790K / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X

As I said, there aren't many LB items who feel as good to use as Rolfo FUTTIES. I was lucky enough to have packed her from a party bag SBC, but all players can now get her by completing the SBC. Make sure to not miss out on this challenge if you're still playing EA FC 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have the first Season 1 Activity challenge in NBA 2K25, and you can get up to 16 Hidden Gems cards for free.


All the packs on offer can be earned without having to spend any MT tokens or VC. Each of them has a specific task associated with them. Complete them, and the packs are yours. While there's a reliance on luck when it comes to the final rewards, it's a great objective to grind on launch day.


NBA 2K25 Hidden Gems agenda tasks


The Hidden Gems agenda has 16 separate tasks. Each task has the same reward - one Hidden Gems pack.



Win 10 Breakout Triple Threat Games


Win 30 Breakout Triple Threat Games


Win 10 Breakout Clutch Time Games


Win 30 Breakout Clutch Time Games


Win 10 Breakout Full Lineup Games


Win 30 Breakout Full Lineup Games


Win 2 Domination Games


Win 6 Domination Games


Win 1 Salary Cap Games


Win 5 Salary Cap Games


Win 1 Showdown Game


Win 3 Showdown Games


Win 5 Showdown Games


Win 3 Games in the Park


Win 5 Games in the Park


Win 10 Games in the Park



The Hidden Gems agenda pretty much requires you to play every mode available in NBA 2K25 MyTeam. Some of the tasks can take a bit of time to complete, so you should start by completing the first objective of each type. At the start of your journey, you'll want to open as many packs as possible.


While all the packs are unauctionable, you'll want to grind the agenda. Yes, loads of cards won't even make your lineup. But there's a 99-rated Dark Matter Michael Jordan available in the pool of rewards. Of course, the odds of pulling him are next to none, but the agenda is easy to complete, and it's free.

Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you need one to give to a villager or critter, complete a quest, or simply want to cook some meals that call for it as an ingredient, it’s always a good idea to stock up on Salmon in Disney Dreamlight Valley. It’s a fairly common and very useful fish.


Salmon can be found while fishing in locations both in the Valley and on Eternity Isle. The fishing spots you need to look out for are usually white, although Salmon can possibly show up in blue fishing spots as well. 


Salmon can be found in the following biomes:



Sunlit Plateau


Frosted Heights


The Wild Tangle



How to use Salmon in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Screenshot by Destructoid


Salmon has a number of uses in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but it can be quite lucrative on its own. While I wouldn’t recommend eating raw Salmon at any point, if you’re in a pinch, it can provide you with 500 energy. If you want to make a quick buck, you can also sell Salmon to Goofy for 150 Star Coins each. 


Quests


There are two quests which require Salmon to complete:


Quest
Villager
Objective


A Place for Joy
Olaf’s level 2 friendship quest
Deliver three Salmon to Olaf


Fishing for Precision
Mulan’s unlock quest line
Catch 10 Salmon and place them in the camp cauldron






Critters


While it isn’t a loved gift for any of the critters in the Valley, it is a liked gift for the foxes in the Frosted Heights. If given Salmon, foxes will drop one of the following items:



Dream Shard


Memory


Iron Ingot



Cooking


Salmon can be used in any recipe that calls for ‘1 of any Fish’, but it is also specifically called for in the following recipes:


Meal

Apple-Cider-Glazed Salmon
1 Salmon
1 Sugarcane

In what may or may not be a kind of a love letter to the awesomeness of Thumper, Ghostrunner 2's latest DLC is a tour de force that focuses exclusively on the aforementioned bike. While we might've said that the ninja-bike was a tad underused in Ghostrunner 2's main campaign, that may no longer be the case now that it's got its own dedicated game mode. The slight kicker that's worth keeping in mind? It appears to be a Season Pass exclusive, at least for the time being.

Hironobu Sakaguchi needs no introduction. As the father of the Final Fantasy franchise, he's the mind behind one of the most successful and popular JRPG series of all time. With FANTASIAN Neo Dimension reuniting Sakaguchi-san with Square Enix, he's spoken about how returning to his former studio — and to Nintendo consoles — feels like coming home.
In an interview with Famitsu (shared via My Nintendo News and Genki), Sakaguchi and Creative Studio III and Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida (known as Yoshi-P) sat down to discuss the upcoming expanded rerelease of the Apple Arcade title. And in the chat, Sakaguchi got a little reminiscent about his time with Square and developing games for Nintendo consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is finally out, so fans can now delve into the magical Hogwarts pastime. But, for those with friends and accounts scattered across platforms, does it have cross-play and cross-progression support?


Quidditch Champions is the latest multiplayer game made by Unbroken Studios, featuring the iconic sport and characters from the Harry Potter movies. Multiplayer games like this are best enjoyed when cross-play and cross-progression work seamlessly among all the platforms they're available on.


Image via WB Games


Does Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions have cross-play?


Yes, Quidditch Champions has full cross-play support among all of its available platforms.


So, if you're playing on PC while your friends are either on a PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch, you guys can queue up and play PvP matches together.


Does Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions have cross-progression?


Yes, Quidditch Champions also supports cross-progression. The studio confirmed this in their FAQ as well. You have to be connected to the same WB Account though, or else the progress won't sync.


I have the game on Steam and have been playing on my PS5 at the same time, thanks to PS Plus, and my progress is easily shared between the two platforms. So, that's a boon for players who have multiple copies of the game and want to continue from where they left off without breaking a sweat.


Now that you know about the game's features, be sure to link Quidditch Champions and Fan Club accounts to unlock exclusive in-game rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Night Slashers? The 1993 arcade beat-’em-up by Data East? Do you remember that it’s getting a remake? Well, that’s out on September 26.


If you haven’t played it, Night Slashers is a solid beat-’em-up. It has the melty, goopy gore of Splatterhouse and the combat of… Um, I was going to say Final Fight, but it’s a lot looser than that. The Konami X-Men arcade game, maybe. It’s a nice mashy time. It was also available digitally last year from Johnny Turbo’s Arcade, but it got delisted.




I hope this remake isn’t the reason. I don’t mean to be dismissive – it has a decent art style, and it adds some additional features – but part of Night Slashers’ appeal was its pixel art style. It was a good-looking game for the time, and its graphics hold up. As much as the modernized art looks fine, it still takes away from the original.


On the other hand, it now supports four players instead of just three. This is enabled by a new character lifted from 1993’s Fighter's History, Liu Feilin. She’s cool, but kind of a disappointing pick. Hong Hua Zhao is already a female Chinese martial artist. So, now we have a cyborg dude, a waiter, and two female Chinese martial artists. I’m sure they control differently and have their own strengths, but diversity, please.


On top of that are some custom modes and modifiers that you can wrap into the experience. The original is a solid game, and the remake looks competently done. It’s $9.99 USD, which seems more than reasonable. Just hard to get excited about.


Night Slashers: Remake is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC September 26, 2024.

This information, as unsurprising as it might seem considering Wukong's remarkable success, comes straight from a major Game Science investor, Daniel Wu. Wu's relatively obscure company, Hero Games, is the biggest third-party shareholder of the Black Myth developer Game Science. He talked about his experiences in a recent interview with Bloomberg, where he plainly stated an expansion is next on Game Science's docket.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In WoW: The War Within, the easiest way to make the best items in the game is to use Concentration to do it. However, this newly added crafting resource is very limited in how much you can use, so the question becomes: how do you get more of it?


How to recharge Concentration in WoW: The War Within


Concentration was added to The War Within as a replacement for the RNG mechanic tied to improving profession-related crafts in Dragonflight. The total profession overhaul that came with Dragonflight shaped the current system we have now, with Concentration being the most notable improvement to it.


So, how do you get more Concentration? The truth is that there is no known method for getting more Concentration by your efforts. Concentration is finite as a resource but recharges over time on its own. There's no way to speed this up, thus limiting the value and rarity of high-budget items a crafter can make at any given time. While this may be disappointing to read, there are benefits to it overall from a community perspective.

As just mentioned, no single crafter can always make the best items (at least not easily), which results in professions staying relevant significantly longer throughout the lifespan of an expansion. Dragonflight succeeded in doing this with its RNG-based system, but crafting items never felt great entirely dictated by how lucky you are. This is why the Concentration System was introduced.


Concentration gives you, the crafter, more control over your actual crafts. You can determine when you want to throw all your efforts into an important craft without wasting time or resources. Since using the mechanic guarantees you the next rarity of a chosen item, you will always know what your output will be the moment you hit that 'craft' button.

Now they're ready to join the ranks of both the Horde and Alliance, and this guide will show you how.


What are the requirements for unlocking The Earthen Allied Race?


The key requirement for this new group of playable characters involves a heavy investment into The War Within's story. There are four specific elements that needed to get an achievement called "Allied Races: Earthen." Once you have that achievement, the new race is yours.

Masahiro Sakurai is back with another video, but rather than focusing on specific aspects of game development, he's insteading providing some general workplace advice that we reckon everybody should heed, regardless of what kind of industry you work for.
The advice is pretty simple: don't fight with your colleagues. With the games industry specifically, Sakurai states that it's probably a lot smaller than anybody thinks. Therefore, it's highly likely that you'll wind up working with the same colleague on different projects; even if you've moved to an entirely different development team.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is gearing up for its first paid story DLC, 'Mask of Darkness,' which lands in the meaty metroidvania on 17th September.

While Netflix’s original anime spin-off, Terminator Zero, doesn’t entirely shake the uncanny sameness of its predecessors, it boldly…

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

We are back with the latest look at Japan's video game sales chart (via Famitsu) and it has been quite the week for new releases, with eight titles in the top ten making their debut.
The big newbie for Nintendo fans is the arrival of Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, which is performing far better than it is in the UK and has landed fifth place with 25,028 copies sold. It's Gundam Breaker 4 on Switch, however, that takes the top spot this week with 52,825 sales (the PS5 and PS4 versions land in third and sixth respectively).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here comes the Sun.
Despite the energetic title of this collection, the legendary Japanese development house Sunsoft never really went away. It's been steadily cranking out original titles, ports, and remasters on arcade and console since 1978, although it will likely never recapture the glory days of the 8- and 16-bit era. So prolific was its output that anyone who owned an NES or a SNES will have likely had multiple Sunsoft games in their collection. This Sunsoft is Back! bundle presents three titles released for the first time outside of Japan, beautifully emulated, and boasting a full English translation.
First up is the fantastically titled Firework Thrower Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tokaido. Playing as the titular explosive merchant, you must reach your fiancée in Edo, beset on all sides by a rival merchant's mercenary band. Kantaro’s adventure is a fun scrolling platformer of sorts, which has you dealing with tricky projectile-throwing arcs against enemies that bounce all over the place. Nailing a good shot against an approaching ninja is satisfying, but overall this one is a bit simplistic.

Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

As of today (5th September), McDonald's customers in Australia can nab themselves a sweet Mario Kart toy with every Happy Meal thanks to the latest crossover with Nintendo (thanks, Vooks).
Unlike the cardboard collaborations we've seen in the past (like last year's Mario Movie European collection), this Australian range consists of ten plastic karts with some familiar faces behind the wheel. Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Toad, Toadette, Bowser, Peach and Yoshi are joined by a swanky Gold Mario and Rose Gold Peach this time — though all of them are Kart-only, so don't expect any bikes like we saw in North America a little while back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

"From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

In support of a motion to dismiss, EFF says that copyright law isn't a tool to silence critics and a fair use defense will prevail.

Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite malware having an even worse reputation than piracy, until now police operations to take sites down, explicitly because they're involved in both, have been pretty much non-existent. This week, music industry group IFPI revealed Operation Redirect, "the first operation of its kind in Brazil to target illegal sites associated with malware distribution." Intrigued by the announcement, we took a closer look and found plenty of drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you forget to build a graveyard. It happens. When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

In the absence of an official announcement, earlier today we took an early sift through the wreckage.

Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated".

In Ireland, anti-piracy group FACT in partnership with Crimestoppers would like you to 'report' this activity. These 'snitch' initiatives are not widely embraced by the public but with a six-week social media push, the campaign aims to identity new enforcement targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

It's still that, but now it's getting a 1.0 release on October 4th.

Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.

The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've yet to discover a SteamWorld game I don't like. Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.
