No need to worry about a mewtiny here — the next entry in the Cat Quest series has undergone a bit of a name change, but that swashbuckling spurr-irit is still there. Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean — now known as Cat Quest III — has received its debut gameplay trailer today.
Taking the cute and accessible action RPG to the high seas, you'll be the fluffiest sailor in the land as you pull into pawt and explore the Purribean. The Gentlebros is keeping the traditional hack-and-slash combat we've come to know and love, but now you'll be able to ride ships and tackle other scallywags by firing cannonballs at them.

Following the launch of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk earlier this month on the Switch and PC, developer Team Reptile has now released its first major patch for the game.
Due to the "certification process" required on consoles, it means this patch has been slightly delayed for the Switch. Although it is only a PC patch for now, it's still an interesting insight into what players can expect when this update does arrive on consoles.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival on Switch as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Of the sports games in the N64 era, Excitebike 64 feels left out of conversation more often than siblings such as Wave Race 64 and 1080° Snowboarding. Perhaps its release later in the console's life cycle didn't give it as much time to gain traction in people's memories, or maybe it's lost in the limelight of its inspiration, the original Excitebike. Whatever the reason, it doesn't detract from the fact that Excitebike 64 is a rather smart motocross game.

The 4.05-inch tall charismatic and loveable vinyl figure robot companion can sit on your shelf at the price of $17.99 plus shipping.
Unfortunately, Vasco won't be there in time for you to start your journey in the stars in Starfield. In fact, Vasco won't ship out until February 2024.
The orange, red, and white Funk POP! actually looks pretty cool. It's a pretty good representation of Vasco as well, even with the VAS-119 identifier on the front.
https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1696900601701945545/
Even though it would be cool to have an army of Vasco's, you are limited to only three units per order.  According to the listing, the quantities are limited for the exclusive figure.
I wonder if we'll see other members of Constellation such as Sarah Morgan or Barrett in Funko POP! form eventually.
Starfield releases on September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It will also be on Game Pass day one. If you pre-order the premium edition you can get access a few days early on September 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're still playing Pokemon Go, you're probably going to be jazzed about the latest addition to the game: the Paldea region. A handful of new creatures are entering the fray soon, which is scheduled for a September 5 at 10AM (local) through September 10 through 10AM (local) debut.
Because it's Niantic, this isn't a full kickoff for Scarlet & Violet; just a drip-fed rollout of a select few characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRYjvkKwkmA
Here's the full list of Paldean Pokemon coming to Pokemon Go at launch:
Sprigatito
Floragato
Meowscarada
Fuecoco
Crocalor
Skeledirge
Quaxly
Quaxwell
Quaquaval
Lechonk
Oinkologne
Here are the evolution requirements:
25 Sprigatito Candy to evolve Sprigatito into Floragato, and 100 Sprigatito Candy to evolve Floragato into Meowscarada.
25 Fuecoco Candy to evolve Fuecoco into Crocalor, and 100 Fuecoco Candy to evolve Crocalor into Skeledirge.
25 Quaxly Candy to evolve Quaxly into Quaxwell, and 100 Quaxly Candy to evolve Quaxwell into Quaquaval.
50 Lechonk Candy to evolve Lechonk into Oinkologne.
Bringing a selection of Paldean Pokemon into the fray still isn't a big win
Rubbing salt in the wound, Niantic also announced in that same blog post that Unowns were returning to the raid pool, but they haven't addressed many complaints from fans earlier this year. There are constant posts on many communities talking about how they play less (myself included) after the remote raid price was hiked to 195 Pokecoins in March of 2023. This is on top of stingy reward payouts for players.
Oddly, Generation 8 starters (and much of the Galar region in general) are nowhere to be found, which is confusing a ton of fans. The Pokemon Company has a lot of sway here in terms of what actually gets rolled out when, but Niantic's track record has given folks pause as to when that might actually happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio's Sea of Stars launched this week, with a spot on both Xbox and PlayStation's subscription services. Despite that, it looks like the new RPG is already chalking up strong sales. The studio's confirmed that on day one, Sea of Stars accrued 100,000 copies sold.
It's a strong day one for an RPG from a relatively smaller studio. As of this writing, Sea of Stars is sitting on the Steam Top Sellers chart alongside the likes of Starfield, Baldur's Gate 3, and Armored Core 6.
But it's an especially interesting stat given that Sea of Stars is available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. It's at least an indication that Sea of Stars is becoming another surprise hit, in a year already full of bangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jkeh6O1Rzs
Starry eyed surprise
There's a few good reasons to pick up a game, even if you have it through a subscription. I know I've personally used Xbox Game Pass as a way to demo a game, and if it's something I know I'll want to play later on down the line, I'll buy it so I don't lose access if it leaves Pass. Sea of Stars had a demo prior to launch, and may have left a strong enough impression that people locked their license in based off that.
Or maybe people are also like me, in that they buy games without remembering they were on Xbox Game Pass/PS Plus. I'm not the best barometer for sensible purchasing decisions.
Either way, it's a reaffirming notion to see Sabotage's RPG chalking up numbers fast. It's been a golden year for RPGs, and it's nice to see that's not just for the biggest blockbusters.
We're still picking away at Sea of Stars here, but if you're a fan of chill fishing minigames, Mario RPG-style combat, and great music, it's worth a look.

The system won't detect offences in real time, nor will it be able to kick you from games for effing and blinding. It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.
You can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November.

Set to hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC for $49.99 with a scaled-back approach and a much shorter runtime, Ubisoft indicated it was using Mirage to return to the series’ roots, serving as a spiritual successor to Altair’s adventure that started it all. 
However, Mirage wasn’t always its own game; it started as DLC to 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. 


“At first, we were working on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and the DLC, and the idea came up to create a specific expansion for Valhalla and go back to the Middle East,” Mirage creative director Stephane Boudon tells me in the Ubisoft Bordeaux office. “We want…]]></summary>

At the time, organizers cited both "continued disregard" for COVID-19 dangers and increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals as reasons for taking the event online instead.
Now, AGDQ 2024 is gearing up to run this January in downtown Pittsburgh instead. The charity event is still largely the one you probably know of by now, too. For one week, 24 hours a day, speedrunners will demonstrate all the unique and intriguin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jump up, Superstars?
In October 2023, two of video gaming's biggest rivals will go head-to-head in a historic showdown pitting the platforming heroes and erstwhile rival mascots against each other in a manner that hasn't been this on-the-nose since the infamous console wars of the early '90s.
In the blue corner, Sonic Superstars launches on Switch (and other platforms, of course) on Tuesday 17th October. Built around the physics of the Retro Engine that powered the sublime Sonic Mania, this platformer from developer Arzest is bringing four-player co-op to the 2D Sonic series for the first time and is looking like a promising new — perhaps even 'New' — version of the classic side-on platforming that still excites many a fan of a blue Sega sky and a follicle-frolicking breeze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami has announced that their HD remaster of the first two Suikoden games have been indefinitely delayed. Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars will now arrive sometime later.
Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars was announced nearly a year ago with a vague release date of 2023. Since then, we haven’t heard much about it.
The Suikoden games are a bit obscure in North America, but they have a dedicated fanbase. The first game in the series was released in Japan on PS1 in 1995, with the sequel following in 1998. The last title to be released in North America was the 2008 spin-off for the Nintendo DS, titled Suikoden Tierkreis, while the last Japanese title was Gensō Suikoden: Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki. It’s no surprise that Konami has sat on the series for so long, as the publisher is legendary for hating fun.
https://youtu.be/ibpBLv47IaY?feature=shared
The remasters are currently showing off some updated visuals, and Konami has stated that they’ll also have some quality-of-life updates and other fixes over the previous versions.
It may also be worth noting that series creator Yoshitaka Murayama is now working on Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, which is said to be a spiritual successor to the Suikoden series, and is planned for release in 2024.
No new release date for Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, but 2024 sounds like a decent bet. It’s slated for Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Switch. You might be interested to know you can still get the first two titles on PS3 via the PlayStation store. They don’t, however, have the planned quality-of-life updates.

        <updated>2023-08-30T16:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Sony announced the next slate of monthly games for the month of September. It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.
The PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.
On September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:
Essential - $79.99 (from $59.99)
Extra - $134.99 (from $99.99)
Premium - $159.99 (from $119.99)
You can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.
In the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.
The move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T16:18:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a couple of months after Microsoft increased the price of Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus will be following suit. In a post on the PlayStation blog revealing the September PS+ titles, it was revealed that the 12-month Subscription prices for all tiers will be increasing.
Interestingly, this only affects the 12-month bulk buy for the subscription. Prices for the 1-month and 3-month subscriptions are not increasing. Essentially this just means you won't be saving as much by buying the bulk 12-month package. In total, it's a $20 increase annually for the Essential tier, a $35 increase for Extra, and a $40 increase for Premium.
Here are the new 12-month subscription plans:
PlayStation Plus Essential 12-Month Subscription
PlayStation Plus Extra 12-Month Subscription
PlayStation Plus Premium 12-Month Subscription
If you have an existing 12-month subscription, the increase begins on your next renewal date on or after November 6. However, the new price takes effect on September 6. This means any upgrades, downgrades, or buying additional time for your subscription will update your plan to the new price.
Subscribers have expressed their dissatisfaction with the price increase in the comments on the blog post. It's especially discomforting to see a price increase in the same post as a very disappointing reveal for the September monthly games. One of the three additions is a premium pack for MMORPG Black Desert Online, which in a way feels more like an ad than a game addition. Also, Generation Zero is one of the added titles for which we scored a 2.5/10, if you're curious if it's worth trying.

Enter the Chronosphere feels like one of those games. Devised by Melbourne, Australia-based Effort Star, it sees you assembling a crew of alien roughnecks to breach and despoil astral "gigastructures" in top-down view. These gigastructures consist of tightly-packed disc-shaped labyrinths with distinct colour schemes, vegetation and screwy spacetime dynamics. 


One of the PR bulletpoints calls on you to "choose between stabilizing your wounds, or reality itself." You'll also get to "plunder paradoxes" and kill people with wasps. Quite the spread! Let's have a look at the trailer.

We have been excited about the retro-inspired RPG Born of Bread ever since we first heard that it would be launching on Switch this summer. We got a slice of the action earlier this month when a demo rose onto the eShop, but now developer WildArts and publisher Dear Villagers have announced that the game will need a little more time to prove, as it will now be served up on Switch 'this Fall'.
This is a shame, to be sure — we love that little bread boy — but it is always better to see a game get pushed and come out working than have it rushed and broken. To lighten the mood, the team has released a brand-new gameplay trailer (above), showing off some more of the game's Paper Mario-style gameplay, comical writing and rather catchy soundtrack.

At Gamescom, a new live-action trailer was revealed to get fans into the space exploration mood. You can also be an explorer here on Earth by locating the 1,001 unique ads Bethesda has hidden all over the world.
https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1696543447761432748
As Bethesda has explained, these ads are "windows to the worlds" of Starfield, providing a peek into what you can expect from the game. The ads that have been found so far don't contain much besides stunning art from the game, though fans have been having fun locating them all.
[caption id="attachment_400303" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
Find all Starfield's 'Windows to the Worlds'
The number of ads is likely a reference to Todd Howard's claim that the upcoming game will feature over 1,000 planets. Finding them all is a monumental task, but fans have been coordinating themselves in Bethesda's official Discord server. Currently, Bethesda's established server channels for the following locations, though not all the listed countries have found ads yet:
Australia
Belgium
Brazil
Germany
Italy
Middle East
New Zealand
Netherlands
Nordics
Poland
South Africa
Spain
United Kingdom
All the ads are also numbered, making it easier to keep track of which have been discovered. Four have already been found in London, with one spotted in Tufnell Park. If you don't locate any of the Windows to the Worlds, you'll still have a chance to see Starfield ads as they've also been spotted on buses in London and Australia, as images in the Discord server reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the reveal of Destiny 2: The Final Shape certainly could've done with an extra banger or two, Bungie is now seemingly on a bit of a path toward redemption with the Destiny community after the failures of the Lightfall DLC. The studio's hype machine for the 2024 DLC is already ramping up, though, and an all-new interview held by the Game Director, Joe Blackburn, shed additional light on next year's grand release.
Notably, Joe Blackburn has taken the lead with Destiny 2's promotional efforts as of late, positioning himself as the new face of Bungie's franchise efforts. Whereas the studio previously attempted to depersonalize its community efforts due to excessive harassment, Blackburn has done away with that, for better or for worse, and a recent interview with PC Gamer allowed him to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios, New Blood Interactive, and Apogee Entertainment have announced that the delayed console versions of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition will be arriving on September 29 to PS4, Xbox One, and Switch.
Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition was released on July 31, 2023 on PC. Originally, the console versions were going to launch simultaneously with the PC. However, they were abruptly delayed about a week before the expected launch.
The PC version packs in the original campaign, all the expansions, a newly created campaign, and a tonne of comfort features to make it the best version of the legendary 1995 FPS.

If there’s any difference between the PC and console versions, the press release doesn’t really say. In particular, I’m wondering if the map maker and fanmade Return of the Triad campaigns are going to make it in.
I gave high marks to the PC version of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. As a shooter, it’s a little bit of a tough sell in the modern market. It does a lot to hide that it’s built on a beefed-up Wolfenstein 3D engine, but still suffers from a lot of restrictions. However, the development team clearly had a fun time on the project, and that shines through. Also, Nightdive’s efforts at porting the game to the KEX Engine are impressive and comprehensive, as always.
Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition is currently available on PC. It will be released on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch on September 29, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first saw the "dog" mechanic in Pikmin 4, I was skeptical that it would even work. After playing Pikmin 4, I want the dog modded into every game before it. Yes, that dog, adorably named "Oatchi," is arguably the start of the game. Not only does it look cute: it also heavily factors into the storyline of the fourth main iteration, and it's one of the most useful game mechanics I've experienced in a long while.
It took very little time to get acclimated to how the little pup worked, and before long I was riding along with him, sending him on odd jobs while I split up my Pikmin force. Dandori (the art of organization, essentially) is a huge part of the game's philosophy and level design, and Oatchi slots perfectly into that ethos. As someone you're able to independently operate alongside of the different types of Pikmin, it's a blast to discern what jobs he's best for, and what upgrade tracks you want to tackle first. "Build potential" is not something I ever thought I'd be tinkering with in a Pikmin game, but here we are. Did I mention Pikmin 4 rules and you should play it?
I love it when Nintendo gets weird
All of Oatchi's glory is reflected in a new promo titled "Oatchi, the Space Dog of Tomorrow," which you can view below. Expect lots of old-school sci-fi references, not unlike most of Bethesda's Fallout marketing. It's also not a bad way to see what the game actually entails, and what Oatchi does in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, I had to. The Starfield pre-launch hype continues with a specially crafted song from Imagine Dragons. The song, titled Children of the Sky, incorporates the main theme music from the open-world RPG. In the video for the song, we also get a special fly through the world—well, universe—of Starfield.
In the video we get a look at the protagonist, our playable character, walking across the surface of various planets with beautiful skyboxes above. Some of these views are ones we haven't seen before, but that's to be expected as Starfield has over 1,000 planets in total.
Imagine Dragons is no stranger to making music specifically for games. Their hit song Radioactive was used heavily in the promotion of Assassin's Creed III back in 2012. Also, Imagine Dragons has made music specifically for League of Legends and its hit animated Netflix series Arcane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1a-OrikdM&t=4s
Whether you're a fan of Imagine Dragons or not, one thing is certain about Starfield: the hype is very real. If you are a fan of the song, it's already available on all music streaming platforms like Spotify.
Starfield releases on September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It will also be on Game Pass day one. If you pre-order the premium edition you can get access a few days early on September 1.

Fortunately, Crate Entertainment is at it again to remind us that the genre goes far beyond Blizzard. The creators of Grim Dawn have announced that the studio is working on a huge new DLC: Fangs of Asterkarn.
A journey westward where the legendary Berserkers reign supreme, the key highlight of Fangs of Asterkarn is the introduction of the "transformative" 10th character Mastery. Crate Entertainment promises that players will get to embody a "frenzied force of destruction" by shapeshifting into various beasts. Those jumping into Fangs of Asterkarn will have access to no less than 45 multi-class combinations once the DLC releases.

In the run-up to the release of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 later this year, publisher GameMill Entertainment has been gradually drip-feeding us information on the new fighters that we can expect to see stepping into the ring. We have already clocked Squidward and Jimmy Newtron in the announcement trailer, but today we have learnt that teenage superhero Manny Rivera (aka El Tigre) will also be suiting up to join the upcoming family-friendly fighter.
Just in case you haven't come across this feline face before, allow us to provide a little refresher. El Tigre is the superhero star of Nickelodeon's 2007 show El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, which saw the 13-year-old protagonist taking on his family's heroic genes as the masked cat-like crime fighter. Only running for the one series, this is hardly the biggest name in NASB2's already stacked list of big names, but the reveal trailer promises that this is one fighter to watch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appropriately for third-person shooters featuring icky electric zombies, Invader's Daymare series has crept up on me. The second game, Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, launches today. It casts you as Dalila Reyes, a special agent of Hexacore Advanced Division for Extraction and Search, aka H.A.D.E.S., and - wait a minute, I know this vibe! That annoying acronym? The washed-out, cadaver-on-concrete set dressing? The gimmicky ice-gun and scanner mode puzzles? The not-so-subtle undertones of Monolith and Midway? Characters with big glowy gadgets on their backs, so you can track them through poorly-lit warehouses?


For all the 90s setting, this looks to me like a homage to shooters of the early/mid noughties, when every action game took place in an office block, prison or garage, featured some kind of paranormal auxiliary ability, and owed a few cinematic chromosomes to the Matrix. Get a load of that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a February 2022 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that the first three mainline Front Mission games would get modern remakes exclusively for Switch. Front Mission 1st: Remake hit last November, and now, nearly a year later, we finally know when Front Mission 2 will arrive.
That date is October 5, following a delay from it's previously announced June 12 launch. Front Mission 2’s revival is significant because it has never been released outside of Japan, originally hitting shelves in 1997. Set 12 years after Front Mission 1st, it stars Ash, an O.C.U. soldier who tries to escape the nation of Alordesh after its overrun by a revolutionary group, only to discover a broader conspiracy. Check out its story trailer below. 


The remake’s features include improved loading times (addressing a big criticism of the original version), free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new coloring/camouflage options, and additional language support. 
Front Mission 2: Remake will be available for $34.99. To keep up with every major upcoming remake, be sure to visit our complete list of them here.]]></summary>

And it was hilariously impossible to summarise in the space of a short, sharp 30-minute appointment. While the elevator pitch started off fairly naturally, there came a point where the elevator rocketed up into the atmosphere and spiralled out of control. I won’t pretend to completely understand what the exact measure of the game is, but I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash of things that don't form a cohesive whole.

Players can easily combine the Banner of War effects alongside their favorite Exotic weapons and armor. And, best of all, it fulfills the Titan power fantasy, encouraging Guardians to get right in the face of their enemies. 
After the last few sour notes for the community, this feels like a win. Bungie and the Destiny 2 community haven't been on the same page for a little bit, with tensions coming to a head following a disastrous State of the Gam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the Steam Deck currently dominates the mobile PC gaming world, competitors are gunning for a slice of the action. In addition to the ASUS ROG Ally and the rumored Lenovo Legion GO, there's now another device on the horizon. This one comes to us from Ayaneo.
The relatively new Chinese company has already offered its own Steam Deck rivals in the guide of some Ayaneo portable devices, and now a new one called Ayaneo KUN is on the way soon. Over on the company's Indiegogo page (thanks, GamesRadar+), the KUN looks to be a veritable powerhouse.
With a "super large" 1600p screen, an AMD Ryzen 7 APU, a beastly battery, and loads of touch features, it could find a place in this emerging handheld market.
[caption id="attachment_400224" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Ayaneo/Indiegogo.[/caption]
With great power comes great cost
Currently, the Ayaneo KUN is expected to arrive in October. According to GamesRadar+, you can expect to pay at least $999 for it. However, with that extra cost, you'll get a lot more power compared to the Steam Deck.
The starting option comes with 512GB of storage. Meanwhile, the priciest model (which could set you back at least $1,700) will boast 4TB of storage and 64GB of RAM. That's quite the beefy machine when stacked up against Valve's system.
With a 75Wh battery as well, it sounds like a portable PC that could topple the Deck. But that price tag presents a much steeper barrier to entry.
It looks like we're about to see an influx of mobile gaming devices. Valve will need to be diligent to stay on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pong is one of those video games that I don’t need to explain. I say Pong and you can see it in your mind. But what if Pong was more? What if that ball you batted around for decades could escape and see the world? That’s the question asked and answered in Qomp 2, Atari’s upcoming, and odd, sequel to Pong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoyed the hellish aesthetics of Agony and the psychosexual tones of Succubus, you may be looking forward to Madmind Studios' upcoming game, Paranoid. If so, you'll want to check out the twelve minutes of gameplay the developer uploaded to their YouTube channel.
The footage puts us in the shows of Patrick Calman as he makes his way through a sewer. All the while, he contends with voices taunting him and hostile sewer-dwellers getting in his way.
https://youtu.be/copCSWCHDLg
We get to see a little bit of the story, in which the 31-year-old Calman is experiencing trauma from the loss of his parents and the kidnapping of his sister. The footage is still a work-in-progress, but you can get a feel for how the game looks and plays.
A different kind of hell
At the moment, there's no release date for Paranoid. The Steam page shows an October 2023 launch window, which would make sense given that this is a horror title. A Halloween release wouldn't exactly be unusual for the genre.
How will it compare to the likes of 2018's Agony? Hopefully much better, as that game didn't receive an amazing reception, with some even calling it the worst game of that year. Our reviewer didn't even finish the game.
Conversely, 2021's Succubus earned better scores, with it showing as "Mostly Positive" on Steam, so there's hope for Paranoid. As mentioned, the above gameplay footage is still a work in progress, so any jank should be ironed out by the time it releases. Should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several years of teasers and delays, Starfield's release date is almost upon us. If you're planning to play on Xbox Series X/S or you purchased your PC version on Windows Store, preloading has been available since August 17. Steam players had to wait a little longer, but preloading has finally opened.
[caption id="attachment_400251" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
It's a good idea to preload this massive game
You're advised to take advantage of the chance to preload if you want to play as soon as possible. The preload alone weighs a hefty 116GB, which could take a while to download for those with less-than-stellar internet speeds. By dealing with the preloading now, you make it easier to start playing when launch day hits.
If you purchase the regular version of Starfield, you'll finally be able to explore the Settled Systems on September 6. For those who can't wait that long, the Constellation Edition and Premium Edition are also available, and they both grant you early access from September 1. Fortunately, if you bought the Standard Edition and change your mind, an upgrade to Premium Edition is available.
It's a large game as it is, and it may grow bigger. The first story expansion, titled 'Shattered Space' has been revealed, and owners of the Constellation Edition and Premium Edition will have access to it when it launches, though it hasn't been given a release date yet.

These remasters were revealed last September, packaged into the same collection and given a release window of 2023 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam. However, that was the last time we heard of these games. Yesterday evening, Konami gave us an update, stating they had been delayed out of 2023.

“Regarding the planned release of Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts and our dedicated development staff to release the remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve,” the update reads. “The entire Suikoden team is renewing our efforts to bring Suikoden I & II HD Remaster to release as soon as is possible.” 
Konami says it will share further release information as soon as it becomes available on official channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary and/or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. 


Fast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, "episodic" - content "cadence" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.

The Pokémon Company has today announced that a brand-new live-action series about Pokémon is set to air in Japan from 19th October — however, it may not be the show that you would expect (thanks, Serebii).
Unlike the ace 'live-action' animation of the Detective Pikachu film, this upcoming series — titled 'Pocket Filled with Adventure' in English — doesn't appear to be set in a Pokémon world, but rather it will be about the act of playing Pokémon.

Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).
Technically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.
"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out'," Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. "In fact, it was the opposite," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was "who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's "creative sequel" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads.

The intense mech action franchise debuted in 1997 but remained niche, with an ardent fanbase keeping the series afloat. Developer FromSoftware was quite a different place then versus today, with the '90s studio publishing a mixed bag of gems and duds.
When Armored Core debuted on the PlayStation, it became one of those gems. As archaic as its controls feel now, they fit the bill for early 3D action games and worked effectively without analog sticks. Sequels iterated on the series' design, releasing multiple expansion-like titles within a generation of games before a full, numbered entry would set up a new narrative arc.

The new retro-inspired RPG Sea of Stars made its debut on the Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms this week, and it's already off to an incredibly strong start.
In an update on social media thanking fans for their support, developer Sabotage revealed the game sold 100,000 copies on its first day of availability. That's quite an impressive feat for an indie game and considering there are many more playing the title on Xbox's Game Pass service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The existence of Sonic Superstars is a beautiful, mystifying conundrum.
If you owned a Sega Genesis growing up, you probably know that a co-op Sonic game is a bad idea. Sonic runs too fast, the screen moves too quickly, and player two often gets lost off-screen. So when I learned the upcoming Sonic Superstars would offer a multiplayer sidescrolling Sonic experience, I couldn’t help but scratch my head. Sure, our own Eric “the Hedgehog” Van Allen covered this already, so I knew the game was already toying with some 2D Sonic fundamentals. But the how and why of a Sonic Superstars co-op mode continued to eat at me. How could a game like this ever work?
Fortunately, during a recent event held by Sega, I was able to sit down with a demo of Sonic Superstars that let players get into the trenches…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Role-playing games can often promise a grandiose adventure, and there's certainly been no shortage of those this year. Some of the heaviest hitters of 2023 are lengthy RPG journeys that advertise dozens upon dozens of hours of questing and storytelling. So it's nice when a game like Sea of Stars lets me hang up my adventurer's hat for a little bit of fishing.
I'm only a few hours into Sea of Stars, which is out today on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It's a chill, interesting RPG that definitely has some love for the golden oldies, but also has some neat ideas of its own. Not surprising, given its the team that made a similar retro-modern fusion in The Messenger.
And while I could easily talk about the combat system and its intricacies, or the art and music, or some intriguing characte…]]></summary>

These slapstick delights made it a cult classic, but rights-holders Ubisoft haven't done much with the game since.

Now a group of modders have been given a "completely blank check" by Ubisoft to do what they want with their efforts to build a modding SDK for the nearly 20-year-old game, and their ambitions include co-op and raytracing.

        <updated>2023-08-29T21:02:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samba De Amigo: Party Central is out now, to the rejoice of anyone craving a Latin-themed music game. The original game produced by Yuji Naka received several ports since its 1999 release, but this marks the first proper sequel since then.
Party Central launched with an exciting and colorful trailer featuring its cast dancing to Mr. Worldwide. It's a stylistic choice I approve of, as a Miami native.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9j1maxNVs8
Beyond marking the revival of a classic franchise, Samba De Amigo: Party Central fills a hole for more stylized rhythm games. Anyone wanting to bust a move while at home was pretty much stuck to the Just Dance games, so this will be refreshing to anyone wanting something different.
Something odd about this release is its chosen platforms. Nintendo Switch is unsurprising due to the type of game this is, but it's also coming to Apple Arcade as Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go. It looks like it'll be fun regardless, and will likely appeal to many casual players with the subscription. A VR Samba de Amigo is also expected sometime later this year.
Multiplayer is the highlighted feature in the trailer, but there is also a story mode. Given the musically whimsical nature, it looks like a light-hearted adventure featuring protagonist Amigo and friends.
While Samba De Amigo: Party Central looks like a blast, the game lacks one of the original's iconic features. Something that made it special was the special maracas players used to follow the beats, but Joy-Cons and touch controls have seemingly made them outdated.
Still, it's good news for Sega fans and rhythm game fans. Assuming it lives up to the original game, Party Central can hopefully be a wonderful revival of a classic franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WayForward announced a major addition to River City Girls 2 with the launch of a four-player online mode. Beat 'em up fans have been brawling with up to three friends locally for a while, but now online co-op extends to four players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. 
This follows some recent patches that have been put in place to improve balance and performance. Animation was increased to 60FPS on PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC along with upgraded Switch performance. Combos and juggles have also been adjusted for a more user-friendly experience. Those who already traversed the mean streets from end to end can continue to do so with repeat playthroughs of New Game+.

Return to River City
To get everyone up to speed on the series, WayForward shared a River City Girls series trailer. The games flip the script on the River City Ransom story, this time tasking Misako and Kyoko with rescuing their kidnapped boyfriends. The sequel ups the stakes and has our heroes brawling with the yakuza to take the city back. It's all set to lively pixel art visuals and a scorching soundtrack by Megan McDuffee. The Sean "Jacksepticeye" McLoughlin-voiced Godai narrates the overview below. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyQyKdKIPrA
After the first game's 2019 debut, River City Girls 2 made its way to consoles and PC in December 2022. As as a spinoff to the Kunio-kun / River City Ransom series, WayForward carved a nice little niche of its own. If you're looking to get into the series, WayForward introduced new digital bundles that pack in all three games. River City Girls, River City Girls 2, and River City Girls Zero are all included for a $74.99 bundle price.

Well, as it turns out, Starfield was initially going to follow in the same footsteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gameplay trailer for the hand-drawn horror game Bye Sweet Carole has made its online debut, showing off its classic animated film-inspired visuals. Publisher Just For Games and developer Little Sewing Machine first announced the "thrilling horror adventure" back in April. Following a cinematic reveal trailer in June, the first gameplay preview was showcased behind closed doors at last week's Gamescom event. Now the rest of us can see how the visuals carry over to the adventure-style gameplay. 
As the trailer notes, footage comes from a "very early" pre-alpha version of the game. Complete voice acting (in Italian and English) and other final assets will be added later. I'm getting some real Clock Tower vibes from the footage so far. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuM4LqSR_5A
Timeless inspirations 
Bye Sweet Carole comes from Remothered creator Chris Darril. Much like Studio MDHR's Cuphead, the developers behind it took inspiration from cartoons of the past. Instead of citing specific films, they simply give a nod to "the greatest animation movies." Feel free to fill in the blank with your own personal favorites. There's definitely a classic Disney / Don Bluth aesthetic to it all. 
[caption id="attachment_399997" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via Just For Games[/caption]
The story finds Lana Benton trailing Carole Simmons, who previously escaped 19th century orphanage Bunny Hall. True to its name, a colony of wild rabbits has taken over, all with the power to open a portal to the world of Corolla. Don't feel left out of this lagomorph legend, though, because you'll also be able to transform into a bunny. 
Bye Sweet Carole is currently in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Don't mark your calendars just yet, because it won't be ready until sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An in-depth look at Super Mario Bros. Wonder will take place in a dedicated Nintendo Direct this week. The presentation is set to air on August 31.
Beginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET the Direct will run for about 15 minutes and, hopefully, peel the curtain back on Wonder’s new features and power-ups. The game's biggest change centers on the Wonder Flower, which transforms stages into trippy versions of themselves laden with mind-bending effects. More than anything, however, we’re excited to see more of Mario's new elephant transformation as well as the elephant versions of his friends.
Join us for an in-depth look at Mario's latest 2D side-scrolling adventure in the livestreamed Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct!

August 29, 2023
Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the next 2D sidescroller in the legendary franchise. Mario is joined by Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy in an adventure that can be enjoyed with up to four players. The game is slated to launch on Switch on October 20. Most recently, we learned that Mario's long-time voice actor, Charles Martinet, has retired from the role and does not voice Mario in Wonder.]]></summary>

That's right folks, I may not have laid my hands on big Todd's mega RPG Starfield, but I've actually tasted its universe, in the form of a promotional drink handed out at Gamescom. It’s composed of cinnamon and stardust, with the boundless expanse of space taking on the form of a grey liquid goop. I’ve got to admit, I think it makes for an excellent beverage, and could perhaps have elicited more excitement from me than the game itself will on release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to "-gate" status, with "Tilegate" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing "dreamable" space sim Noctis. 


Who knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.

They're almost constantly aware of everything that you're doing. So much so, that they can even get a little bit creepy about it, as was made plain in my hands-off demo session.

So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.
Blazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampires might be the themed threat for Diablo 4's second season, but it was arguably its own player base who drew first blood when season one started at the end of July. As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as "a perfect storm of a couple of situations" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. 
"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again," says Fergusson. "As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the first derelict and/or abandoned (but is it really abandoned???) spaceship you ever visited in a videogame? I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. 


Does Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile "Legendary" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about "the tragedies and perils of space travel".

As part of our last issue's cover story, we provided exclusive insight into Sonic Superstars, the upcoming 2D platformer starring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog. We gave first hands-on impressions with several never-before-seen zones (read all about them here), but I recently got my hands on another all-new zone that I didn't see earlier this summer.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/08/28/here-are-the-starfield-pc-specs-required-to-run-bethesdas-sci-fi-rpg"/>
        <updated>2023-08-28T16:54:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is almost here. Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. 


Here are the PC specifications for Starfield: 
Minimum: 
OS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti
DirectX: Version 12
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
Recommended: 
OS: Windows 10/11 with updates
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080
DirectX: Version 12
Network: Broadband Internet connection
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
As you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. 
Starfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. 
While waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. 
Are you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many attempts have been made to recapture the JRPG's glory days. In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's "HD-2D" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is.

The news was announced last night. Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance. Her now-iconic portrayal of Harley Quinn resonated with fans, and she became the breakout character of the show. Harley…]]></summary>

Sea of Stars is like a great genre film by a skilled director. It looks and feels familiar; you basically know what to expect and can probably even predict the major beats, but it doesn’t hinder the experience. The intention is so well-executed that I was eager to soak it all in and, in this case, swim in the stars. I dreaded Sea of Stars’ conclusion not because I feared the worst but because I didn’t want to leave the world and stop playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But you know. In a good way. My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.
I may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like Warframe, Digital Extremes’ shockingly enduring free-to-play action RPG, but I do find its sci-fantasy direction a bit much. The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. 
The Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, Tenno! This message comes to you from that primeval epoch known as "Last Wednesday", when Digital Extremes treated RPS to a preview screening of the Warframe update announcements planned for this year's Tennocon - a special Tennocon indeed, coinciding as it does with the game's 10th anniversary and the studio's 30th. Alas, "Last Wednesday" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, "Today" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency. Fickle are the winds of history! Still, even with the limited insight of our time, we grasped at some sense of the offering's magnitude. Read on, if you dare.

Some criticism also fell upon its four classes, who lacked the 'career' subclasses of its developer's previous game, Vermintide 2.

Darktide's classes will therefore get an overhaul October 4th, when an update will introduce skill trees for each class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 will feature a familiar face in actor Shawn Ashmore. While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. 
Ashmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. 
The brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx
August 25, 2023
“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment," says Ashmore in the video. "Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will."
Alan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest. You can watch the latest trailer from Gamescom 2023 here and read our impressions of a Summer Game Fest demo featuring Saga here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're in the midst of an unspeakably good couple of months for game releases, even if you ignore the boring corporate ones that we'll never hear the end of. The downside of such a bounty is there are even more gems getting overlooked than usual, because nobody has the time even when we're aware of them. Like, for example, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

It absolutely is the Jet Set Radio tribute it looks like, and it's a delight even if, like me, you never really liked the originals. Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.

Well, not a habit exactly, but it's happened three times now, which is enough to make it a thing. Fugue In Void, by Moshe Linke, is technically and literally a walking simulator, in that you are going for a walk and that's all you do in it, but what it simulates you walking through is kind of a surrealist nighmarescape of raw concrete. I know I'm supposed to be making this game sound like something you'd want to play. Honestly, it's very good.

Developer Larian instead published a portion of the patch details on a Steam blog and the rest on their forums, which were briefly  down - probably either due to an online traffic jam or just, again, the patch’s sheer size. Regardless, we have well over three thousand words worth of details on today’s patch, which addresses around one thousand bugs and graces us with “Short King Summer” before it’s too late. But beware: there are some spoilers in the patch notes.

Prefabs and ride sharing are the big new additions coming with the free 2.0 patch, alongside the option to discover other player’s creations across platforms. Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.
The game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.

That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.
Maybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will hold my hands up and say that I didn't get on too well with One More Level's first Ghostrunner game. While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest season of Fortnite – Last Resort – is now live and it brings a new battle pass with plenty of skins to the game alongside new points of interest on the map, returning weapons, new items, and more. The theme of this season is centered around heists, both of the sneaky and guns-blazing kind, and curiously, a vampire at the heart of it all. 
That vampire is named Kado Thorne and he’s made the battle island his home in Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4. He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. 

Epic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards. And inside, you’ll find Thorne has filled them with …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Jump Over The Age revealed Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, a sequel that occurs “some time” after last year’s Citizen Sleeper. Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. 
The game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: 


“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” 
This sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” 

If you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. 
There’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. 
In the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has been perhaps the biggest surprise hit of 2023 – we gave it one of the highest scores of the year – although Early Access players have been singing the RPG’s praises for a while now. It launched on PC earlier this month and is due on PlayStation 5 next month. Earlier this summer, Larian said it wants to launch Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox this year but might push into 2024 due to parity issues between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.

My approach to games is pretty unruly is what I’m trying to say, but there has been one game that tamed my rampaging ways and that was Cappybara Games’ Below.
Below is a game that’s best played slowly. You’re tasked with reaching the bottom of an island’s subterranean caverns, trying to survive against monsters, traps, starvation, and dehydration. Each layer is shrouded in darkness meaning that you only have the small ring of light from your torch to watch carefully where you step. Charging through these levels is the quickest way of getting sliced and diced, and when you die, you begin back on the beach right next to the boat you arrived on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is a meditative climbing adventure by Life is Strange developer Don't Nod. First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.
The game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. 
Web of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. 


If that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nacon has rolled out a new trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City while also announcing a November 2 release date in a press release (a delay from its original September window). First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. 
Actor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. 


Naturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. 
RoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Lil Gator Game launched last December, it captured our hearts as a fun, cozy adventure that drew obvious inspiration from the Legend of Zelda franchise. The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.
The free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.
Lil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC. For more on the short-but-sweet adventure, check out our review.]]></summary>

But this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, "the entire game will be good", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.

At its core, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk wants to remind you how cool other games were. Specifically, Jet Set Radio, Jet Set Radio Future, and a tiny bit of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The problem is, by choosing nostalgia as its sole focus, Bomb Rush lacks an identity of its own – it only reminds me of why I'd rather play those other games instead. 
Bomb Rush attempts to right one of Sega's great crimes: the 21 years we've gone without a new Jet Set Radio game. For the uninitiated, Jet Set was an action sports series that put you in control of a gang of rollerbladers terrorizi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome have revealed that AK-xolotl will hit consoles and Switch this September. More specifically, the top-down roguelike shooter about a cute but deadly-with-a-gun axolotl will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14. 
The team announced this release date during today’s Future Games Show presentation with a new trailer showing more of the amphibious creature’s violent stroll through the animal kingdom, and it looks great. It features a fun retro throwback visual style and plenty of arcade-like action in combat. 
Check out the AK-xolotl release date trailer for yourself below: 


To coincide with today’s news, a new extended AK-xolotl demo is now live on Steam. Playstack vice president of publishing Rob Crossley says the game’s previously released demo hit almost 70,000 downloads and with player feedback from that demo, 2Awesome has “really managed to expand on some ideas and add a few new really cool features as well.” Some of those new features are present in the new demo, but Crossley says some are being held for the final release. 
AK-xolotl features five unique biomes, each with a variety of enemies, as well as dozens of weapons and power-ups. There are “tons of Axolittles to find and raise” and bosses you’ll love to hate, Playstack says. 

AK-xolotl hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Crunching Koalas and Developer Label This Studio revealed its psychological thriller, The Gap, last year at the 2022 Future Games Show. Now, the team has returned to this year’s Future Games Show with a new trailer for The Gap and an October release date. 
The Gap will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 19, and preorders for the game are now live. Today’s new trailer is about Maria, who seems to be either the wife of protagonist Joshua Hayes or his daughter. In The Gap, players must explore Joshua’s memories, both of the joyous and heart-wrenching kind, to find a solution to his family’s affliction thanks to a new rare genetic disorder. 
Check out the latest trailer for The Gap for yourself below: 


“Delve deep into the human psyche in The Gap, a psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves together the realms of memories, emotions, and corporate intrigue,” a press release reads. “The game revolves around Joshua Hayes, a dedicated neuroscientist, whose life takes a sudden turn when his family becomes afflicted by a rare genetic disorder. As memories fade and sanity slips away, Joshua is faced with an unimaginable challenge: finding a cure before his family’s essence is forever lost.” 
Here are some screenshots from The Gap:

As for BioWare’s two known in-development games, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and the next installment of Mass Effect, the studio says production on both are continuing. It says it is confident it has the time needed to ensure Dreadwolf reaches its full potential while a “core veteran team” led by Mike Gamble continues pre-production work on the next Mass Effect.

It maxes out at 7400MB/s reads and 6500MB/s writes, near the boundary of the PCIe 4.0 standard, and random read/write figures are impressive too despite lacking a DRAM cache, using HMB instead.

As a member of the niche mech-action genre, Armored Core has been out of commission for some time. The last entry in the series was a full 10 years ago, and since then, developer From Software’s other titles (Elden Ring, Bloodborne, etc.) have made the developer a household name. Now, the studio has returned with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (ACVI), applying many lessons from its other action games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aperture Desk Job is full of unexplained details. Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. 
On its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that roguelite sequel Streets Of Rogue 2 was going open world, but we finally saw the free-flowing chaos in action at last night’s Gamescom blowout. The immersive sim playground, sequel to an RPS favourite from 2019, looks even more over-the-top than the original. You can smash through buildings in a truck. Or smash through buildings on horseback. Or smash through buildings as a giant gorilla. Or... you get the gist. In other words, there should be a metric mega-ton of options when the game hits early access next year, as you'd expect if you played the first Streets Of Rogue.

This week, the company filed a lawsuit against a group of online stores that sell pirated DVDs of key titles such as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power' and 'The Peripheral'. While these DVDs may look real they are definitely pirated, as these series are only available on Amazon Prime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.


The original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights.

It's being made by Supermassive Games, who specialise in horror games (although not quite the same as the nitty-gritty childhood terrors style of Little Nightmares). Following the trajectory of the previous two games, Little Nightmares the third has two controllable protagonists, so you can play in co-op. It also has a tie-in podcast, to build out some of the Little Nightmares lore, a thing you might not have known existed.

Now, two and a half years following the release of the last mainline entry, fans of the first two critically acclaimed games have something new to be excited for. Bandai Namco has announced that Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games is developing a new entry in the Little Nightmares universe. Not only that, but we got our first look at Little Nightmares III.
Little Nightmares III gives players the story of Low and Alone, two children trapped within The Spiral, which is a cluster of disturbing places, and they need to work together to escape from a threat that is lurking in the shadows. Little Nightmares III is still playable as a single-player with a CPU-controlled partner, but you can also…]]></summary>

This summer’s announcement of Mortal Kombat 1 brought with it a new era for the long-running fighting franchise. The latest game from NetherRealm Studios brings the outstanding fighting mechanics the series has been known for since the 2011 reboot, but adds layers of complexity. The most notable addition to the core mechanics in this entry is perhaps the Kameo feature, where you can bring in a secondary character to perform a quick move at a crucial time in a fight.

For starters, your inventory will no longer become clogged with six billion gems. Season Of Blood will also let you pick specific Unique and Uber Unique items to farm bosses for, which is most welcome given how vital Uniques can be for builds. Here, watch the trailer.

The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you. So let's back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.

The trailer begins with a cinematic cutscene setting up the ensuing fight as Liu Kang challenges Sindel to a duel by way of Raiden. It doesn’t take long for the trailer to become a gory mess of blood and guts, though, as we see Sindel, General Shao, and Raiden face off in various fights. The trailer also reveals two additional Kameo fighters: Motaro and Shujinko. 
Check out the Rulers of Outworld Mortal Kombat 1 trailer for yourself below: 


"As supreme ruler of Outworld’s army, General Shao has proven loyalty to his realm through countless victories in battle and possesses a gameplay style that dominates opponents with conquering strength and iron will," a press release reads. "Sindel is the empress of Outworld who fights to protect her family and empire with the ability to vanquish enemies with her mystifying hair, piercing scream, and power of levitation." 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap took fans of both the popular comics and movies company and collectible card games by storm last year thanks to its bite-sized, exciting gameplay and compelling collection and leveling-up mechanics. Both the mobile and Early Access PC versions have received various updates that include a Conquest series mode, friend PvP, and a ton of new cards and variants, but the PC version has remained in Steam Early Access until now.
However, during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, developer Second Dinner Studios' Ben Brode announced that Marvel Snap has exited Steam Early Access and is officially out now on PC. To celebrate, players who log into the PC version of Marvel Snap will receive a Devil Dinosaur Mech Variant. Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. 
"Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we've worked really hard to ensure it's an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love," Brode said in a press release. "This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can't wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we're live."
The PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today's livestream below.


Marvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer's Top 10 Games of the Year list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Frontiers was released late last year, it was generally regarded as good but "rough around the edges." Because of that, it's been great to see Sega move to support the game further post-launch with a series of updates with free content. Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as "The Final Horizon" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.


The teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.
For any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now.

In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.
Sonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.
This announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.


Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20. We already knew this fall and holiday season would be fantastic for gamers, but it looks to be particularly awesome for fans of 2D platforming. For more on Sonic Superstars, be sure to hit the banner below for exclusive details surrounding the highly anticipated 2D adventure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom Opening Night Live provided a platform for a new gameplay walkthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The video focuses on a new wrinkle called Open Combat Missions. These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.
You can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. 
Similar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals.

We now know that the shared-world survival game will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in an Early Access state on February 22, 2024. 
In Nightingale, you control a Realmwalker as you venture through arcane portals in a procedurally generated Victorian gaslamp fantasy universe. Though survival crafting serves as the core gameplay loop, the studio touts its world-building and excellent visuals. The studio also pushes forward its ever-evolving narrative, which emphasizes play autonomy.

"[The Early Access date] is a few months later than previously announced," Inflexion Games CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. "But as a studio, we're committed to quality and take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfils our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come."
You can watch the Nightingale Early Access release date trailer below:


Nightingale arrives in Early Access via Steam and Epic Games Store on February 22, 2024, for $30. According to Inflexion Games, this launch will mark the beginning of the road to a 1.0 launch, with a high level of collaboration with the community. Inflexion hopes to continue iterating, improving, and adding to the game as the Early Access period continues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pearly Abyss, the studio behind Black Desert Online, has released a new trailer for its upcoming single-player open-world RPG, Crimson Desert, and it features our first look at new gameplay since 2020. 
The studio released this trailer as part of Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live presentation for Gamescom, and it features new 4K footage of protagonist Kliff investigating the region of Hernand. It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. 
Check out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. 
“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” 

Pearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch.

        <updated>2023-08-22T18:05:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Game Science has released a new trailer for Black Myth: Wukong. Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony today, Black Myth: Wukong continues to look great.
Today’s trailer showcases more of the game’s action RPG combat alongside its dive into Chinese mythology. The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. 
You can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” 
Today’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom's Opening Night Live event, CD Projekt Red shared a new trailer and took to the stage to share what is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don't buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.


The footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.
The 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day. You can find Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review by following the link.]]></summary>
