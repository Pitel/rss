        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the year concluded, discussions were already percolating about whether 2023 was the best year for video game releases ever. It was a challenging year for the industry as a whole, but in terms of artistic output, 2023 is absolutely a contender. Whittling the year's releases to a mere 10 games was challenging, but we did it (you can read our top 10 right here).
However, the year's game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you'll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

We got a 2023 release window alongside a new trailer back in 2022, but the mod needed more time, missing a release this year. Now, Team FOLON has revealed Fallout: London will be released in April, as reported by Eurogamer. 
More specifically, it will be available on April 23, 2024. The team announced this date in a new developer update released on December 23. In it, the team shows off more of the work it's done since its last trailer, highlighting well-worn and lesser-known locales of London alongside enemies, weapons, and more. It ends with the April 23, 2024, release date announcement.

Looking for the best new Nintendo Switch games releasing soon? 2023 was a banner year for the now-ageing hybrid console, and even if it looks like the Switch is winding down as it approaches its eighth year on the market, there are still plenty of beauties to pick up in 2024.
In terms of first-party offerings, Another Code is making its grand return, as is Mario vs. Donkey Kong. Princess Peach is taking centre stage in a brand-new game. And remasters of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon are on the way. The third-party slate is looking pretty healthy too — maybe 2024 is the year we finally get Silksong, as well?

Unlike characters like Mario, Link, and Kirby, all of whom retain the same general look across their respective franchises (okay, Link is a little more varied than the other two, but still), Samus' basic design can be altered quite drastically from game to game.

Although 2023 has been a landmark year for incredible video game releases across all platforms, the state of the gaming industry itself — with post-pandemic layoff announcements from big companies coming on a seemingly daily basis recently — is sobering. Looking outside the realm of interactive entertainment, much of the global news isn't any better; in fact, it's often far worse.
With all the economic and humanitarian crises around the globe, we try our best here at Nintendo Life to inject a little positivity into your feed. The daily doom scroll might suggest that there's not much beauty in the world right now, but we're certain that's not the case, and the realms of media — interactive or otherwise — have been filled with wonders to help process the realities of a world that, at times, feels impossibly fractured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year as stuffed with great games as this one, it was always inevitable that lots of very good ones would be left on the cutting room floor of our Advent Calendar this year. It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.
In any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.

Below you'll find a list of categories in which we highlight things that have caught our eye throughout the year; things that have put smiles on our faces or caused us to raise our eyebrows in bemusement. Whatever the reason, we think these games or game-related things deserve a shoutout as we close out the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, that's a wrap on 2023. It was, by all accounts, a strange year.


On the game release side, there were some pretty incredible ones launched this year. And on the games industry side, it was historically fraught, as thousands have lost their jobs. Even the media side felt rough this year, as we saw outlets cut staff and close doors.




For me personally, I managed to do some writing I'm proud of, but it's still been tough. My hope is that 2024 doesn't have this stark contrast at the end, but only time will tell. I certainly feel games like Metaphor, Rebirth, and Dragon's Dogma 2 are already set up to make a big splash.


On the games front though, it was absolutely stellar. 2023's games got me through a lot. I'm certain we'll be talking about them for years to come, ranging from the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar is no stranger to leaks, and it seems the company can't even catch a break during the holiday season. 


It has been reported that GTA 5's source code has been leaked. According to @GTAFocal, an account that follows all Grand Theft Auto-related news, the contents of the leak aren't new and originated from the massive 2022 GTA 6 leaks. However, until this point, the data had been shared among private groups alone. 




Though some have been brazen enough to post the content on Twitter, Take-Two Interactive is taking down links leading to the leaks. This isn't the first time Rockstar has suffered a leak this year, and just a few weeks ago, we had the GTA 6 trailer showing up before Rockstar intended to debut it. 


While it might be tempting to have a peek behind the curtains to see what's going on with the GTA developers, it isn't the wisest idea to provoke a company that has shown itself to be willing to use the full might of the law to protect its IPs. The teen behind the infamous GTA 6 leak in 2022 was deemed unfit to stand trial and has since been given an indefinite hospital order. 


With a confirmed 2025 release date, it won't be long before we get more information on GTA 6 from official sources. As the reveal trailer has shown us, the upcoming crime game will be taking us to the state of Leonida which is "home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond."

        <updated>2023-12-23T15:10:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everybody calm down! It's happening! Everyone's favorite sword-wielding android, 2B, is coming to Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising. I didn't know that I was missing her but it's abundantly clear that I was.


In a move that is both simultaneously surprising and not, Square Enix is licensing out one of its most popular characters. It appears that the puppet character, Nier, will have some competition in several ways.


When is 2B coming to GBVSR?


During Granblue Fes 2023, Cygames and Arc System Works announced the Nier: Automata star would be joining the fantasy fighter's roster in February 2024 as part of the Deluxe Edition Character Pass 1 or for $7.99 individually. In addition to 2B as a playable character, she'll also be usable as a Premium Avatar as part of the DLC.


For those who don't speak Japanese or want to sift through 6+ hours of footage, a post was made on Twitter (now X), including a 65-second video of the blindfolded battler. 




2B makes a rather stylish entrance with Pod following some conversation between the baffled Gran and Djeeta. She then gets to work with both the Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty swords before unleashing a Skybound Art with several Pod units.


She looks formidable with large sweeping attacks, quick-fire attacks from Pod, and teleporting dodges aplenty. I'm certainly excited to try her out as, despite not really enjoying Nier: Automata's story, 2B's design and gameplay completely won me over.




This isn't 2B's first foray into fighting game territory, as she previously traveled back in time to fight against the likes of Nightmare and Voldo in Soulcalibur VI. She was a ton of fun to play then and her appearance in GBVSR looks to be a repeat performance. Whether you intend on playing her or not, it'll be wise to practice against her in the training mode as she's likely to be a popular pick following the release.

With just two sleeps to go before the big day, we are unwrapping a present early here at Nintendo Life. It's a festive edition of What Are You Playing! Something about 'What Are You Sleighing' sounded a little too sinister...
Before we sledge into our gaming plans over the holiday period, however, let's take a look at some of the week's holiday highlights. We chatted to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's director about the game's anime inspirations and uncovered the secret purpose of Hyrule's Shrines in Tears of the Kingdom. We also kicked off the GOTY discussion with our picks and highlighted some of the very best games that you can pick up in the Switch eShop Festive Offers sale.

The Finals offers rare novelty in the competitive multiplayer genre, encouraging creative strategies impossible in other titles because of its immense environmental destruction, physics-based hazards, and armory of whimsical gadgets. This first-person shooter occurs amid a digital game show where varying counts of three-person teams fight over money caches in an objective-focused format.

I bought them some time ago. I haven’t played them. They intimidate me.


Classic CRPGs are terrifying. I often say that game design doesn’t expire; it merely changes, but one common feature of ‘80s and ‘90s CRPGs is a wall of overcomplicated UI. The game itself might be relatively simple, but the sheer number of buttons, menus, and functions is staggering. I’ve been stopped while trying to create a character.


So, for the purposes of this article, I decided to finally step into SSI’s D&D world. Not in an RPG, goodness, no. I’m still terrified. Let’s, uh… Let’s start with 1990’s DragonStrike, th…]]></summary>

And while I don’t think that advice was totally necessary, I still don’t know how to begin describing the experience.


For lack of a better option, the best way to understand this game is to understand its creator. Astlibra was developed predominately by one Japanese developer who goes by the name “KEIZO”. From what I’ve gathered, KEIZO is not a professional game designer. So in addition to his full-time job, Astlibra was the passion project he worked on in his free time. In that sense, Astlibra isn’t unlike that one RPG Make…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, the rough year of 2023 for the games industry continues. Indie Publisher Versus Evil announced on Twitter today that parent company TinyBuild has shut down the company and laid off all the staff. Head of Production Lance James confirmed the closure on Twitter as well. 





"Welp. That was a fun 10 year ride. The entire Versus Evil team has just been laid off. Let me be clear - this wasn't a Versus Evil decision or choice."
- Lance James, Versus Evil Head of Production



Legal issues between the two companies recently ended


According to GamesIndustry.biz, earlier this month TinyBuild announced that it had settled a legal dispute with Versus Evil's former owner Stall Proof LLC. General Manager Steve Escalante and Head of Production Lance James were also involved in the legal dispute. In the end, TinyBuild paid $3.5 million and legal costs to settle the dispute, and Escalante left the company shortly after.


Over a decade of publishing


Versus Evil was founded in 2013 by Steve Escalante, who served as Marketing Director at ZeniMax Online Studios prior to doing so. In 2021 TinyBuild acquired the company as well as its QA Studio Red Cerberus. Over the last decade, Versus Evil has published very popular titles including The Banner Saga from developer Stoic and Obsidian Entertainment's Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.


It's been as rough a year as I can remember for the games industry. This one feels extra cruel as we're just a couple of days away from Christmas and a little over a week from the new year.


We reached out to TinyBuild for comment but have not yet received a response.

        <updated>2023-12-22T19:57:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japan, Hoshi wo Miru Hito for Famicom is considered a kusoge no densetsu or “legendary crappy game.” One of the worst games of all time. It never made it to North America, but now we can share the pain, as a complete fan translation for the game has been released.


There had been a previous attempt at a translation made by modder KingMike, but it was never fully complete, leaving much of the battle text in Japanese. Last month, user Brandnewscooby released a patch for that patch, which picks up where KingMike left off and finishes the translation of the battle text.


Image via Romhacking.net


Sometimes called Stargazer by Anglophones, Hoshi wo Miru Hito is an RPG that Hardcore Gaming 101 calls “hilariously embarrassing on just about every level.” The RPG genre exploded in popularity in Japan following 1986’s Dragon Quest, and Hoshi wo Miru Hito seems like a pretty blatant attempt at trying to get in on that boom. It does bring some interesting things to the table, including a futuristic setting, and managed to just barely precede Fantasy Star.


However, every idea the team had seems to have been executed rather poorly. While considered to be somewhat charmingly inept, there are severe balancing issues and incredibly obtuse mechanics. The fact that English monoglots may now be able to understand the text doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to actually complete the game.


It was reported back in 2020 that City Connection was going to release the game worldwide, suggesting an official translation, but it only saw release in Japan.


Until we eventually get an official translation for Hoshi wo Miru Hito, you can find the initial fan translation patch here and the patch for the patch over here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Via Twitter, Insomniac has responded to the massive hack against the company and the subsequent leaking of their documents.


If you’re not familiar, Insomniac was targeted by a ransomware attack that resulted in a group of hackers gaining access to a great deal of footage from upcoming games, as well as a myriad of documents ranging from future plans to internal HR documents. The hackers then released some of this information, with threats of publishing more if their ransom demands weren't met.


“We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it has taken on our dev team. We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other,” Insomniac's release says.




The statement acknowledges data involving “personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.”


Hacks and leaks have been happening in the video game industry for decades. There have even been recent attacks against Sony and Rockstar, with the latter resulting in leaked development footage of Grand Theft Auto 6. Activision was hacked late last year, and it has been reported that employee information was compromised as a result of that, though the company claimed that it wasn’t.


But regardless of the company involved, I feel bad for the employees involved. I’m sure having development footage of a game that isn’t ready to be shown off yet is vexing and disappointing, but having HR documents stolen can be traumatic. Having them leaked on the internet can lead to horrible problems for the people affected.


As for Wolverine, Insomniac says that development is continuing as planned, and the team will share "official information" when it's ready.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear ye! This month marked the 25th birthday of Thief: The Dark Project. While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.


Notable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, ransomware group Rhysida released more than a terabyte of data it illegally obtained by hacking Marvel's Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac Games. The hacked data comprised of more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, including information about Marvel's Wolverine, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more.
Insomniac has now publicly addressed the hack in a new statement, stating that development on Marvel's Wolverine will continue as planned.
An update regarding Insomniac and Marvel's #WolverinePS5. pic.twitter.com/CMkCCoZwwj
December 22, 2023
Here's what the studio said, in full: 
Last week, Rhysida revealed it had hacked Insomniac Games, posting images to prove the validity of its claim and demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Somy within seven days or it would release what it had discovered. Sony did not comply with the demand and the ransomware group released 1.67 terabytes of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac. 
Insomniac just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Park: Snow Day, the upcoming four-player cooperative adventure first announced in August, is coming on March 26. A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.
As the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like the most recent South Park titles, The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. 


Players can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. 
South Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Contact Entertainment is a studio specializing in VR games, and it is behind titles like Firewall: Zero Hour and Firewall Ultra. It has announced that it will be shutting down by the end of the year. 


According to the announcement from the studio, a "lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll." Though the company wishes it could continue with its AAA VR projects, it has become impossible to justify the expenses. 


This is notable news for the VR community, as Firewall: Zero Hour was a popular PS VR title that had earned itself good reviews. Firewall Ultra was released for the PS VR2, though it failed to impress players as much as its predecessor. 


Employees have commented on the imminent closure on social media, celebrating their time with the studio while announcing their availability for new opportunities. They join the ranks of thousands of other gaming industry employees who have found themselves in a similar position this year. It has been estimated that in 2023 alone, around 9,000 video game jobs were lost. 


First Contact Entertainment isn't the only company struggling to master the VR space, with Sony also calling it a "challenging category." PS VR2 players looking for first-person shooters aren't out of luck, however. The PlayStation VR2 has a few FPS titles available, with Pavlov being an unmissable standout.

        <updated>2023-12-22T13:59:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fntastic announced earlier this month that it would be closing down, just days after launching its controversial game, The Day Before. It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. 
More specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be "retired." 
pic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny
December 22, 2023
Here's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: 
The Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. 
Over the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: "We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years." 
[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, "Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players." The statement says, "Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]

After almost eight years as a studio, it will shut down at the end of the year. It cites a lack of VR support within the industry. 


"After almost eight years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year," a Facebook post from the company reads. "The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll. As a AAA VR game developer, we are just not able to justify the expenses needed going forward. 
"We are a team of fearless innovators willing to push new technologies to its limits. I am extremely proud of the team and grateful to our investors, our partners and of course, our community of dedicated and passionate players. It's been a wild ride. Thank you."

First, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has been testing the waters with different hardware this year, including the PlayStation Portal and the PS VR2. In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Lempel, the head of global business at Sony Interactive Entertainment, reveals how some of these projects have been faring. 


Though Lempel states that the VR headset sales are "going well," the VR category is still challenging. He argues that "there was a higher expectation generally for what VR would do to gaming." Other hardware benefitted from the Black Friday sales period, including the PS Portal. According to Lempel, PlayStation enjoyed its most successful November ever in both sales and revenue.

Sony is having no problems selling PS5s 


As Sony announced this week, over 50 million PS5s have been sold. This, according to Financial Times, means the console outsold "Microsoft's Xbox by almost three to one in 2023." Lempel comments on the sales milestone, claiming that with prior supply problems solved, the console is "now on track to outsell PlayStation 4" which has sold over 117 million units. 


Referencing data from Ampere Analysis, FT claims PS5 sales grew 65% while the Switch fell 18% and the Xbox fell 15%. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Strategies, states that the divergences reflect differing strategies from the hardware manufacturers: "Sony really cares about selling hardware but from a Microsoft perspective, it’s more about their subscription service."


Sony recently released a slimmer version of the console, and with the right line-up of titles, 2024 could be another successful year for the company. Fortunately, we have titles like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Rise of the Ronin to look forward to.

The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk.

The latter is the most fascinating, in my opinion, as it's seriously faster than its rivals in many games and comes with a better upscaler than AMD's FSR in XeSS. 
Today you can pick up this GPU for just £266 thanks to an Amazon UK Lightning Deal on a graphics card that comes from Amazon US - with no extra import or shipping fees. That compares favourably to the £320 that the next-cheapest A770 GPU costs, especially when you consider this is the better 16GB variant with a factory overclock!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise's long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin's Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's just a couple of winners left to announce as Destructoid's GOTY awards wrap up for the year, and that includes our staff pick for the Best PC Game of 2023.


This year offered a healthy spread of genres, and studios big and small wound up making our cut. Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.


Starfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. 





That is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. 


Our review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. 


I'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.



Destructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:



Baldur’s Gate 3


Starfield


Cocoon


Slay the Princess


Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty


BattleBit Remastered


Dave the Diver

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old hacker behind the massive GTA 6 leak last year, has been given an indefinite hospital order.


Kurtaj is a member of the international gang Lapsus$, which was behind various high-profile cybersecurity attacks over the past year. It is estimated that attacks on Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar have cost the companies up to $10 million. Per the BBC, Kurtaj expressed apparent unwillingness to stop conducting similar attacks. 


It turns out that by the time he committed the GTA 6 hack, Kurtaj was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE. The BBC reports: "Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar, the company behind GTA, using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV and a mobile phone."


Kurtaj and another unnamed member of the Lapsus$ hacking group are the first to be convicted, while others are thought to remain at large, according to the BBC.


In July, Arion Kurtaj was deemed unfit to stand trial following a diagnosis of acute austism. The court then had the jury focusing not on whether Kurtaj had done it with criminal intent, but solely on whether or not he had perpetrated the alleged crimes at all.


Regarding the mediate fate of Kurtaj, BBC reports: "He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger."


The news arrives just a few days after news broke of a massive hack at Insomniac, leaking details about in-development games and information about the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the time of year, folks. The Steam Winter Sale for 2023 is now live, offering some hefty discounts on thousands of games on the Steam store. For me, it's usually when I pick up titles I didn't have a chance to play throughout the year but definitely wanted to at some point. After all, not often is there a better discount than what we see with the Steam Winter Sale, at least anytime soon.




Some great deals


With so many titles on sale at once, usually, you can find games of every genre heavily discounted. This includes new releases and even those that have been out for some time. Here's a handful of great deals I've found while briefly looking over the sale:



Civilization VI — $5.99 (90% off)


Stellaris — $11.99 (70% off)


Total War: Warhammer III— $29.99 (50% off)

Despite having some of the best sneaking action and gunplay, the open world and “missions” structure didn’t necessarily speak to fans of the more linear, tightly scripted feel of the previous games.

It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know that D4 Enterprise is releasing Japanese PC-88 games on Switch? It hasn’t been going on for long, but I just learned it now, thanks to Hydlide. D4 has added two titles to their EggConsole lineup, with 1984’s Hydlide and 1986’s Silpheed.


The PC-88 is a Japanese home computer, similar to the Commodore 64 or Apple II. While we never got it over here in the West, it was extremely popular in its home country. Because of this, there are very few ways for Anglophones to really experience them. The fact that someone is porting games from the platform to Switch is pretty exciting to retro explorers such as myself.


Hydlide is an interesting, but kind of dopey, game that was ported to the NES but originally released on the PC8801. It’s an action RPG that predates both Dragon Quest and The Legend of Zelda. It’s a pioneer! Though, it’s also not a great one. Still worth experiencing for the historical context and its overall importance in the genre. It's the same reason you might play the original Ultima.

Silpheed, on the other hand, is a scrolling shoot-‘em-up. For 1986, it feels so ahead of its time. It uses a lot of 3D effects and has some pretty rocking music. It was ported to other microcomputers at the time, got a semi-sequel on the Sega CD, and lived on through entries on the PS2 and Xbox 360.


Beyond these two games, you can also find Xanadu, Relics, and Thexder already available as part of the EggConsole series. Each one runs for $6.49, which strikes me as a good price. The only thing to note is that parts of these games are still in Japanese, but it appears that all of the important stuff is in English.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a perfect crescendoed sonata of how to wow an audience. At first, I was just impressed with how magnificent and sprawling the sky islands were. By the time I had brute-forced puzzles with unique object manipulation mechanics and discovered the depths of the underground, I was completely enamored.


Breath of the Wild managed to sing a similar song back in 2017, but this felt considerably different. That's worth talking about because at first, some were worried that Tears of the Kingdom would crib way too much from Breath of the Wild. I'll admit, I was even curious to see just what Nintendo had in store for us here; not just from a freshness standpoint, but in terms of the greater reaction from fans.

Ultrakill is set in a post-apocalypse where human blood is the only currency that matters anymore, as it fuels the few robots that remain. Given this premise, it's to be expected that the game's narrative and level design would take some weird turns, but the seventh layer of Hell is particularly noteworthy. Featuring remarkably agile, powerful, and aggressive angelic statues as the first encounter of the new Act, Ultrakill's Patch 14 is a sight to behold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've never played Geometry Dash, you may find you're missing out on one of the most engaging games in the rhythm genre. Now, after several years, not only has a new version been released, but it's caused the concurrent player count to spike to an all-time high.


According to recent data from SteamDB, Geometry Dash reached a peak of 88,346 on December 20. If you look at the graph, you can see how it shot up in the space of a couple of hours, with the previous count showing just under 13,000 players.




Progress on update 2.2 has been a long time coming. In fact, the last update from developer RobTop Games was in October, which said that the proposed November release would "not be doable." Now that it's finally out, we can see just how much people have been waiting for it.


Bouncy bouncy


For those who haven't experienced it, Geometry Dash has you moving through levels of varying difficulties, playing as a simple shape or other object. Jumping over obstacles to get to the end, the game's genius comes from the fact that the level moves along in time to the music.


This necessitates well-timed presses in order to hop over spikes and gaps or wind your way through tight corridors. While I don't want to draw too big a comparison, if you liked the nature of Flappy Bird, this could be right up your alley.


At the time of writing, more than 59,000 people are playing, which kind of shows that the wait can sometimes be worth it in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No judgements here, but if you're a little embarrassed about some of the games in your library, there's now a solution. Not long ago, it was rumored that Steam would allow you to hide titles from others, and now that reality has come to fruition.


In the most recent update to the Steam client, it's now possible to mark your games as private. A post on Steam says there are "times when you might want to keep a few of the games you own" a hidden secret from others. For whatever reason you have.




As such, any games you now deem it appropriate to make private can be hidden from anyone who isn't you. This includes: "your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game." There's an FAQ that tells you how to go about doing this.


It begins at the checkout


The Steam patch also brings with it some updates to the shopping cart. Two new features have been added, which are:



Inline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus, gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.


One cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.




However, it also takes into account the new game privacy settings, by allowing you to hide them at the point of purchase.


Look, I'm not going to go into any details here. We all know why Steam would allow users to not advertise some of the things in their games list. We'll just acknowledge that this is now something many will find useful and we'll move on with our lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[91Act has announced that their BlazBlue-flavored rougelite, BlazBlue Entropy Effect, leaves Early Access on PC on January 21, 2024.


This is the first time I’ve really heard of BlazBlue Entropy Effect, but that’s maybe not surprising since it only launched in Early Access on August 15, 2023. During that time, it’s racked up a 90% positive rating on Steam. In a world where some games seem to be perpetual Early Access titles, It may seem like a short time for a game to be in that state. However, it seems to be right on track with what the developer was aiming for, allowing them to incorporate player feedback and add new features before launch.




BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a side-scrolling roguelite similar to Dead Cells. The emphasis is on fancy, flashy combos, with lots of customization. I’m not super familiar with BlazBlue as a fighting series, but apparently, that’s not a problem. According to the store page (and also Steam reviews), the connection is largely an aesthetic one. It doesn’t tie its story or world into the established canon. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the lore. Weird choice, but it sounds like it works.


BlazBlue Entropy Effect is currently available in Early Access. Its full release is set for January 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, players get the chance to vote for their favorite PlayStation games in different categories. Several titles have won in various categories, with Spider-Man 2 voted the PS5 Game of the Year. 


The win is not a surprise considering its stellar sales and the positive reception it has received from players and critics. The PS4 hasn't been forgotten, and Hogwarts Legacy won Game of the Year for the console. According to PlayStation, competition was tight, and it squeezed past Resident Evil 4 Remake by a mere half a percent of votes.

Destructoid has too many FFXIV sickos for anything else to take the crown, which is fitting given that our own Chris “Eorzea’s Finest” Carter was an early adopter of the now-legendary MMORPG.


This, inadvertently, presents a bit of a conundrum in terms of selecting the “Best Ongoing Game” of any year. Live service games typically demand a lot of time. So it’s difficult – if not impossible – to find anyone who has played every entry enough to make a fair judgment. It’s hard enough playing the biggest single-player games of the year, let alone ones with potentially hundreds of hours of things to grind for. Can we really say Final Fantasy XIV had a better year than, say, Warframe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's official: The Bobby Kotick era at Activision Blizzard will end on December 29. According to The Verge, Instead of appointing a new replacement, the top Activision Blizzard executives will now report to Microsoft's game content and studios president Matt Booty. Several more higher-level Activision Blizzard employees will also leave the company in the new year with departures planned through March 2024.


A lot of changes up top


It looks like the ripple effects of Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard will really go into full effect in the new year. In an internal memo, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer highlighted some of the changes including the departure of Lulu Meservey at the end of January and Humam Sakhini at the end of December. In March, Vice Chariman of Activision Blizzard Thomas Tippl will leave the company as well as Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, Chief People Officer Julie Hodges, Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton, and CFO Armin Zerza.


End of an era


After 32 years with the company, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's reign comes to an end. His resignation comes just two months after the acquisition of the company by Microsoft. After joining Activision in 1991, Kotick was responsible for several larger acquisitions in the industry including the Vivendi Games merger in 2008 that created Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of mobile game developer King.


However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows with Kotick. Just a few weeks ago his company agreed to pay over $54 million in a settlement with the California Civil Rights Department to settle a very messy workplace discrimination lawsuit.


Kotick will receive a farewell payout of at least $15 million when he leaves the company next week.

I’m not sure I agree, but game controllers are a very personal choice. For years, we’ve essentially been using different configurations of the same thing. To me, four face buttons feel like the optimal number for my thumb to handle, so my preference is the SNES controller, but I can respect anyone who prefers Sega’s six-button design.


And for those people, there’s now Retro-Bit’s Sega Saturn Wireless Pro Controller, which, beyond just being a rather faithful wireless translation of the console’s input, slaps a couple of analog sticks on there so you can also use it for modern game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 brought a lot of classic games back into the fold, but I always knew one certain title would inevitably take the crown for best remake/remaster. Resident Evil 4 rides a fine line of feeling old and new to an impeccable degree, and I’ve got to admit, it’s a heck of a remake.


Resident Evil 4 is one of those games that transcends the legacy of the Resident Evil series itself. Personally, it wasn’t the first Resident Evil game I played, but it was the first one I finished. Its combination of action, RPG elements, and incredible campy dialogue just worked for me. And judging from how I’ve seen others talk about this game for almost 20 years, I’m clearly not alone there. It’s one of those games that frequently comes up in “greatest game of all time” conversations, and at one point in my l…]]></summary>

Final Fantasy VII Remake set the tone for what players could expect from this three-part retelling of the beloved 1997 Square RPG. The excellent updates to the combat system, the fantastic expansions on character relationships, and the stellar production values told us Square Enix is not taking the responsibility of remaking one of its most iconic games lightly. However, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks to take several components of the experience to the next level, largely thanks to its emphasis on side content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sawaki Takeyasu and Ignition Games' El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron somehow came out over 12 years ago. Takeyasu's company Crim purchased the rights a couple years after launch, and now the HD remaster finally has an April 28, 2024 date for Nintendo Switch. 


Crim announced the date for the port along with publisher Rainy Frog. El Shaddai will hit Switch both physically and digitally in Japan, including a physical deluxe edition priced at ¥8,250 (about US$57). Paying a little extra nets you the game along with a drama CD that comes with a script. Whether this is your first time ascending or you've been looking for an excuse to do so again, you can see more in the release date trailer. 




El Shaddai made its debut in 2011 to somewhat mixed reactions. It's a uniquely stylized action game that isn't necessarily going to be for everyone, but those who vibe with it are probably still thinking about it today. It had a pretty big promotional and crossover push at the time, including one that saw Japanese clothing brand Edwin release some pricey 503 Zero jeans in both Enoch and Lucifel styles. Unfortunately, none of the Switch releases come with themed clothing, so you'll have to hit eBay for a gently used pair. 


Outside of the bonuses included with the Japanese physical editions, it doesn't seem as if there's much in the way of new content here. If good ol' reliable El Shaddai—complete with its rock, paper, scissors combat and blend of 3D and 2D sections—sounds like a solid enough hook in 2024, mark your calendars for April.

        <updated>2023-12-20T19:14:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you love it or hate it, Starfield is one of 2023's most notable releases. For all the things that it does well, there's loads of stuff that Bethesda could improve upon, too. It sounds like improvements should be coming in 2024, though, according to the company's latest announcement.


Work on the company's latest flagship appears to continue in the background. Many of its most pressing improvements have already been outlined in the days and weeks prior, but a few more precious details have just been provided, suggesting what else might be coming.




While Bethesda's already confirmed some of the stuff that's coming to Starfield in 2024, such as new travel options, city maps, and a rough update cadence, there are some curious new tidbits present here. Specifically, the following:



New ship customization options.


New gameplay options that allow further difficulty adjustments.



Bethesda's not provided any detailed information on whether the team intends to simply add new customizations and difficulty sliders, or go all-in on the concept. A survival mode such as the one featured in Fallout 4 is something that players have expressed interest in, for example.


Bethesda's plans for Starfield in 2024


Further, Bethesda's previously confirmed update cadence, with new patches coming in every six weeks or so, won't be kicking in before February. This suggests that there's nothing new coming to Starfield in the next two months or so.


Of course, Starfield's first confirmed expansion pack, Shattered Space, is still on the way. No date has been set for that yet, but the post says it's part of the 2024 plan.


Bethesda's end-of-year post outlining the near future of Starfield development could, therefore, either be taken with a dose of skepticism or hype, depending on one's opinion of what's already there. Things really could go either way for Starfield's post-launch support.

Well, a selection of our favorite anime, managed by me. Hi, I'm Eric. I've been working on getting an anime beat going here, none of which would have been possible without the hard work of writers and contributors. It's an area that doesn't seem wholly outside our purview, and as games overlap even more with the medium, it only feels natural. And it only feels right to open with a recognition of that work.


Throughout this year, we dabbled in ideas, whether those were listicles, news beats, or longer-form features. It's something we hope to continue building up in 2024,…]]></summary>

Although his actual departure date is only a few days earlier, it means Activision Blizzard will be kicking off 2024 without Kotick at the helm for the first time in over 30 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its launch last year, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has received two DLCs as part of its Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline. The first, The Teal Mask, hit Switch in September; the second, The Indigo Disk, arrived last week, bringing with it plenty of returning legendaries and favorite starter Pokémon, too. Now, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have revealed The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be getting an epilogue that hits the game in January. 
The companies announced this today with a brief trailer that teases a new adventure in the "Land of Kitakami" that awaits trainers. The epilogue goes live on Thursday, January 11, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET, and, outside of goodbyes to friends from the journey of Generation 9, today's trailer also teases what appears to be a new Pokémon. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


In order to play through the epilogue, you must complete "a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Violet" and you must complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you have room in that big heart of yours for another fighting game, but don’t know what to try? 2022’s DNF Duel is free on Epic Games Store as part of their holiday giveaways. You have 24 hours to claim it.


I’ve heard of DNF Duel but know next to nothing about it. There was a lot of PR stuff coming at us in the lead-up and some excitement around the launch, but I think the fighting game market is pretty jammed up with heavy hitters to the point where it maybe didn’t catch fire. It’s a tough market for newcomers. It’s a spin-off of Dungeon & Fighter, which I also don’t know a whole lot about.




When I hear the acronym “DNF,” my mind first goes to “did not finish,” and then afterward goes to “Duke Nukem Forever.”


I do know something about the Epic Games Store. It gives away a lot of free games and doesn’t make any money for Epic. I installed it for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed and uninstalled it once that game came to Steam.


DNF Duel does seem like a good time, though. You certainly can’t argue with the price of free. However, you’ll have to act now-ish, since the sale is only for 24 hours. It ends on December 21, 2023, at 11am EST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has announced via Twitter that an epilogue for The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024.


As someone who didn’t buy the DLC because I didn’t quite finish Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the trailer tells me less than nothing. Which makes sense! It’s an epilogue, after all, so it would be easy to spoil things about the ending. Speaking of which, here are the requirements to access the new epilogue content:


-Complete a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet.


-Complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk.




The post suggests that the epilogue takes place in Kitakami and it’s a “new adventure,” but not much besides that.


As I said, I didn’t play any of the DLC. Timothy “Windchime” Monbleau did just recently and sounded like he had the last vestiges of optimism forcibly sucked from his soul. I welcome him to the void. There is plenty of room. I really don’t know how else to describe his critique of the expansion. If you want to know what it looks like when the lights go out in a human heart, it's a worthwhile read.


However, if you have different thoughts on The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, you might appreciate having the story tied up in a bow. Heck, maybe Mr. Monbleau will feel better about his agonizing experience with BBQs once it’s all wrapped up. Who can say?


What I do know is that the epilogue of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are available on Switch. You’ll also need the DLC to access the epilogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.
Since the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.


The holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. 
The milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. 
It’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.]]></summary>

If Epic Games and my Switch were involved, Fortnite and Persona 5 Royal would've absolutely been included in the lineup, too. Motivation has lain mostly in co-op capers with friends, hangs with virtual pals, or in the battle royale-verse. Otherwise, nothing has truly given me the itch.
But I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning. For the first time, I'm excited to embrace the grind both in-game and outside of it.

It's not that I dislike Gunfire's sci-fantasy co-op shooter - the multiple-dimension premise is pleasantly loopy, and I like the variety of procgen landscapes. There just aren't enough hours in the day, not when I'm replaying Into The Breach for the 14th time. Still, perhaps the introduction of a new mode built for quickfix, story-free sessions could persuade me to give 2023's 24th best game another whirl?

The two genres aren't worlds apart - R-Type's bosses, for example, are very Gigery, but they're nothing like as icky as the creatures you face in Angel At Dusk, in which every projectile appears to be some species of maggot, and your ship is a sort of evolving flesh-moth faerie reminiscent of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station.

Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. 


As a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year. This introduces a new subterranean playspace, the Ringing Deeps, and is the first in a trilogy of expansions called The Worldsoul Saga.

I love this mouse because it's extremely comfortable, with a smooth and streamlined symmetric shape that sits easily in the hand, with a lightweight 63g design. This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too. That's why I ended up with two of them - one in black and one in pink - and I still use them on the regular for Counter-Strike 2, Valorant and Warzone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been encouraging to see how post-Steam Deck handheld PCs aren’t merely copying Valve’s homework.  The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.
I’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.

        <updated>2023-12-19T13:35:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, ransomware group Rhysida revealed it had hacked Marvel's Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac Games. It posted images to prove the validity of its claim, demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Sony within seven days or it would leak what it had discovered, as reported by CyberDaily. Sony did not comply with the demand and now the group has released more than a terabyte of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac Games. 
The total leak comprises more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, according to VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily. The leaked data includes information about Marvel's Spider-Man, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, and private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more. Game Informer will not be disclosing any of the hacked information. 
CyberDaily reached out to Rhysida and learned the ransomware group specifically targeted Insomniac Games. "Yes, we knew who we were attacking," a Rhysida spokesperson told the publication over email. The group also told CyberDaily its motivation for the hack was financial. 
Insomniac Games just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man.

The adventure is Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Nioh developer Team Ninja’s first choice-driven, open-world action game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a phenomenal gaming CPU thanks to its Zen 4 architecture and added 3D V-Cache which boosts gaming performance far beyond standard Ryzen 7000 processors. That performance - and extremely modest power draw and a reasonable price - has caused the 7800X3D to become the best selling CPU by a huge margin according to a German PC part retailer. 
Anyway, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to drop in price. Recently we reported on a reduction in the UK, and now it's time for the US to get a turn on the deals train with a new asking price of just $339.99 - a full 40% off its US MSRP. That's a great price for a CPU that even comes with the breathtaking Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch has an incredibly strong library of games, with many worth recommending. For our 10 absolute favorite games, however, you can check out the list below. We will update this list as often as games worthy of inclusion release.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re already caught up on the latest hits.

        <updated>2023-12-18T21:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re looking forward to playing Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, especially to experience its story, your time on the internet just got a little bit harder. Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.
Apparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.
Rocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. 
It’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. 
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. 
You can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James McCaffrey, actor best known to video game fans as the voice of Max Payne, among other characters, has passed away. He was 65.
TMZ reports that McCaffrey died on Sunday after a battle with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. A rep for McCaffrey tells the outlet that the actor died surrounded by friends and family.
McCaffrey's extensive on-screen credits include roles in Law & Order, Suits, and Blue Bloods, and video games such as 2008’s Alone in the Dark and 2005’s Area 51. However, Remedy fans knew him best as the voice of Max Payne in all three entries. Furthermore, McCaffrey voiced Thomas Zane in Alan Wake, Zachariah Trench in Control, and, most recently, Alex Casey in Alan Wake 2.

In a separate X thread, Remedy creative director Sam Lake offered his condolences as well. 
I’m heartbroken to hear the sad news of James McCaffrey’s passing. We worked together for more than 25 years. He was a lovely man and a dear friend. He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/JLcEIMUT43

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars took home the award for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023 earlier this month and now, developer Sabotage Studio has revealed the RPG has surpassed 4 million players since launch. Sea of Stars is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, launching back in August, and is free to subscribers on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium subscribers. 
Alongside Sea of Stars' TGAs win, Sabotage took home the Best Indie Game award at the Golden Joysticks and was recognized by the British Academy Film and Television Awards as one of the best games from 2023. 


"Sea of Stars is the game of my dreams, and seeing its quest resonate so strongly with players and critics means the world to everyone at Sabotage," studio co-founder and Sea of Stars game director Thierry Boulanger writes in a press release. "The team behind this game is the most talented and dedicated group I could have ever hoped to create Sea of Stars with, and I'm again reminded of their brilliance as we progress with creating Sea of Stars' upcoming DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker. 
"For fans to have recognized our adventure in such an incredibly prosperous year for RPGs alongside new arrivals from the genre's biggest franchises, we simply just cannot thank you enough for supporting us, and we can't wait to show you what's next for Sea of Stars." 
In other Sea of Stars news, the game's soundtrack, which features guest tracks from famed Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda, is now available on streaming platforms. It contains all day, night, and pirate versions of songs in Sea of Stars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer shooters have become defined in recent years by the methods they use to withhold power from players, whether that’s a hero shooter's unlocks and battle pass or a survival shooter's vast map of scattered goodies. Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.

The Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor. Those things aren’t an obstacle between you and the childish joy of smashing the world to bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that it is remaking the first saga of One Piece, and it's doing it with one of the best animation studios out there. 
Over the weekend, Netflix released a minute-and-a-half video celebrating the 25th anniversary of the One Piece anime, revealing in it that Wit Studio, the team behind Spy Family and the first three seasons of Attack on Titan, is producing "an all-new anime adaptation of the One Piece manga starting from the iconic East Blue saga." It will come to Netflix, although the company hasn't said when to expect it. 
Check out the announcement for yourself below: 


Notably, the East Blue saga is the first sage of the One Piece manga and anime, covering 100 chapters and roughly 60 episodes, respectively. This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. 
Beyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown.

If I was being uncharitable, I'd say that's because the list is overrun by games with large multiplayer communities that can be encouraged to vote for them - but who would want to be uncharitable? Let's instead say that the list is certainly not boring, even if Starfield gets a nod for "most innovative gameplay".

Good news, Ebuyer has got you covered with deal that bundles the excellent Sony DualSense PS5 controller with a fast Crucial T500 2TB SSD, complete with heatsink.

This deal is marketed as the 'ideal PS5 upgrade kit', but it's actually just as relevant for PC users looking to pick up one of the best gamepads (alongside the Xbox Elite controller also discounted today) and get more game storage at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's always saddened me that Simogo's brilliant text-based adventure Device 6 has been trapped on iOS-only devices since it first came out... ten years ago? Hell's bells, now I feel old. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you're reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. 
Once you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naughty Dog have officially stopped development of The Last Of Us Online, a multiplayer game based on their celebrated McCarthyite (no, not that McCarthy - I mean the novelist) post-apocalyptic action-adventure. Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as "boomer shooters" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.
I reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two months after leaving Platinum Games, co-founder and The Wonderful 101 and Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya has revealed why he left the studio. In a new interview with IGN, Kamiya told the publication he decided to leave "because I felt that the direction the company was heading in was different from my beliefs as a developer."
"Without that element of trust, I couldn't continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way," Kamiya said. "I don't think of games as products, but rather as works of art. I want to put my artistry into games and deliver games that could only be made by Hideki Kamiya, so that players can enjoy Hideki Kamiya games exactly as they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket Arena, the multiplayer rocket-powered shooter, developed by Final Strike Games as an EA Originals title, was removed from sale last month without warning or a word on why, as reported by RockPaperShotgun. Now, roughly a month later, Final Strike Games has announced Rocket Arena will be sunset and its servers shut down in March. 
More specifically, Rocket Arena will come to an end at Noon PT/3 p.m. ET on March 21, 2024. As for why, the team doesn't really address that in its announcement but presumably, it has lost the player count needed to sustain its live-service, multiplayer model. 
Rocket Arena will be sunset on March 21, 2024 12:00 PM PDT. We’ll have some community events leading up to the date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are as many Doom mods as there are stars in the sky: jillions of accursed celestial bodies orbiting the supermassive black hole that is id Software, each infested with its own local flavours of cacodemons and keycards and shotguns. I've played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I've played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.


The mod's overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? "No."

The studio will try to make things right by offering partial refunds to Pharaoh owners and giving away DLC on top of the usual updates.

I believe that these two examples form a representative sample of what mods are: quality of life improvements, and Shrek. Doom’s modding community, known by its file package WAD, is the Ur modding community. Thanks to John Carmack’s lightning-fast engine, creating levels and content for Doom has been accessible for 30 years. WAD devs have gone on to become fully-fledged game designers, and some WADs have been released commercially. The breadth and depth of this community formed the bedrock of game developers. And yet even with this pedigree, MyHouse.WAD is a miracle.

In a blog post, Naughty Dog explains it made the “incredibly difficult” decision to cancel the project after it apparently became so big that the studio realized it would need to devote precious resources to support it post-launch for years to come. When faced with the reality of having to become a studio solely dedicated to supporting a live service game or to continue making single-player experiences, it chose the latter. 
Here's Naughty Dog's full statement:
The Last of Us Online was originally intended as a multiplayer mode attached to The Last of Us Part II, serving as a successor to the first game's Factions mode. Ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.
Luckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:

Concept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[505 Games have released a chunky overview trailer for the heavily Suikoden-inspired RPG Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes – which means it’s time once again for me to share that one Suikoden story I have about how I bought Suikoden 2 for PS1 but got bored and traded it in, and now PS1 copies of Suikoden 2 regularly sell for hundreds of pounds, and why, why, didn’t you keep that in your sock drawer, Edwin, instead of your prized vintage copy of V-Rally, current average eBay price £3.99???
Plus which, Suikoden 2 is clearly one of the best RPGs ever made, Edwin, you blundering oaf, you absolute weapon. Arrrrgh. Hopefully Eiyuden Chronicle will ease the agony a little when it goes on sale on 23rd April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition didn’t launch in the greatest state, but after months of fixes, the game has been deemed ready to launch on mobile devices. The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.
Like all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.


Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. 
In addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I was looking up our Wikipedia page to see what happened this year," says Nightdive Studios' CEO Stephen Kick as we sit down to chat. That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. 


In short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.

On the surface the artworks give away little, but thankfully, I am a Vampire of News, equipped with supernatural vision and insight. Why not come inside my den and let me regale you with some speculations? Don't worry about the red stains on the carpet, that's just, er, strawberry jam from all the doughnuts I've been eating recently. The red stains on the wall? Yeah, that's blood.

Unfortunately, the developer won't be able to hit that deadline, as it posted this update on social media yesterday.

Unfortunately, all that we can really recall is the occasional watch party, and maybe Keanu Reeves was there at one point? Was mostly just trailers, let’s be honest. Thus we also consider the events that replace it (with a side-chat on this year’s Game Awards), and how we’d design our own glittering showcase o' games.
We also share what we’ve been playing this week, make a single non-PC game recommendation (that also represents the strangest coincidence in EWS history), and take another look at the Lenovo Legion Go. Last time I talk about the Lenovo Legion Go for a while, promise.
You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.

It would not have been, all things considered, an unusual question to ask one of the game industry’s leading personalities. The Entertainment Software Association’s Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, has long been a dominating feature of the summer. But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA hasn’t been able to open the doors to the highly regarded in-person convention.
However, Keighley is the driving force behind Summer Game Fest, a newly established but increasingly successful showcase effectively competing with E3. The query came from one of the many viewers who tuned in to see him speak candidly on YouTube following the Xbox/Bethesda showcase, one of Summer Game Fest’s crowning jewels.

I was satisfied with how the story wrapped up, although admittedly, I would have liked a more bombastic finale worthy of the name “Ragnarök,” so I wasn’t necessarily looking for new story content just yet. I was fine to wait for a sequel years down the road, perhaps with Kratos and Atreus traversing through a new line of mythological lands and gods. But I wanted some reason to return to its beautiful world, adrenaline-inducing combat, and top-tier characters.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20231206/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
