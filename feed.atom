Not long after Nintendo added Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards to the Switch Online N64 service a few weeks ago, a game-breaking bug was discovered, preventing players from progressing under a certain condition.
Nintendo publically addressed this last week - revealing an update would be released to resolve the problem (Kirby being stunned in underwater levels) while apologising to players for the inconvenience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plus a handful of villains.
The Metroid series has delighted fans for over 30 years and currently spans 15 different games, with Metroid Prime 4 in development. Samus is the main protagonist of the games, and shocked fans when the fact she was female was first revealed back in Metroid on the NES, but her classic suit and the 'Zero' suit aren’t the only costumes Samus has worn.

Best Metroid Games Of All Time

The bounty hunter has donned many different suits over the years in games and other media that cosplayers have embraced — there’s an entire Facebook group known as The Samus Squad dedicated to the Metroid franchise. She isn’t the only character from the franchise that cosplayers love, either.

The Switch has a good number of strategy games, but next year we'll get a real time strategy title - a subgenre a little less represented on Nintendo's system. Frigato: Shadows of the Caribbean is coming in 2023, developed by Mercat Games and published by Ultimate Games S.A., but will make its debut with a demo on 13th June as part of the Steam Next festival.
It's a while away on Switch, of course, and the trailer above (and the upcoming demo) represent early footage. The gameplay and concept looks like it could be fun, blending Desperados-style gameplay with all the pirate-themed tropes you could wish for, including some supernatural elements.

      <p>Working for a video game website, I engage in many playful, though sometimes heated, debates about games with my co-workers. We recently discussed the best Kingdom Hearts characters, and, surprisingly, several of us excluded Sora from the cream of the crop. However, a defender propped up Sora’s one defining good trait:&nbsp;his overwhelming positivity. In response, I jokingly said if optimism is all Sora offers, he should be replaced by a superior beacon of positivity: Ichiban Kasuga, star of Yakuza: Like a Dragon. We had a good laugh and moved on, but t…]]></summary>

As Squid Kids will be fully aware, the unique, bubblegum score of the Splatoon series is an important and distinct part of the online arena shooter series. This weekend, Nintendo dropped a funky-fresh sample from the upcoming Splatoon 3, giving us a sneak peek at the apocalyptic sequel's vibe.
As performed by in-universe garage band Front Roe, "Sea Me Now" is perhaps a little more Orange County than we are used to hearing from the sticky-icky world of Inkopolis. The new track has a distinct pop-punk sound which reflects the chaotic, graffiti-filled hues of a landscape wherein all of the rules have been abandoned. Don't worry, the utterly bizarre vocal style remains, weirder than ever.
Featuring a rockier vibe than Splatoon 2's more Hip-Hop oriented themes, it seems as if Splatoon 3 will feature a brand new sound accompanying its brand new look. Clearly, the new sequel will be going for a somewhat more anarchic vibe than its predecessors, (as anarchic as post-'00s pop-punk will allow, at any rate). This is all well and good, but I still wanna see my gals Pearl & Marina somewhere in the mix. I'm sure they'll be making a welcome cameo appearance at some point.
Splatoon 3 launches September 9 on Nintendo Switch.

Pac-Man Museum+ follows Pac-Man Museum (2014), a collection for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. This updated compilation includes some of the titles in the previous release, and adds several new ones, bringing the total count to 14 (although Pac-Man Arrangement is featured twice with arcade and home versions). It comprises the most thorough collection of the yellow, pizza-inspired dot’s exploits ever assembled, from the original arcade masterpiece, through to 2015’s Pac-Man 256.
Presented within a 3D arcade, you can move the camera, trotting Pac around, looking at various machines and deciding what to play, each game with its own menus for gameplay tutorials, special objectives, and a little history. You start with 500 virtual coins in your pocket, but there are no microtransactions here. You accrue more coins simply by playing machines and completing optional missions (presented like an achievement leaderboard) that add unique objectives for each title.

Back when Retro Studios was riding high on the success of the Metroid Prime trilogy, not many expected them to jump off of the space bounty hunter's ship and into the jungle in Donkey Kong Country Returns. This fantastic platformer rebooted the Donkey Kong Country series from the SNES with beautiful visuals, tight platforming, and funky music, and it's no surprise a sequel followed suit. But fans were looking for a different game from Retro Studios at the time — a Zelda game.
In an interview on the Kiwi Talkz podcast on YouTube, Eric Kozlowsky — who worked as an artist on Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze during his time at Retro Studios — spoke of how the team dealt with the rumour mill while working on the upcoming sequel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

For many N64 owners back in the day, Rare was at the top of the game. Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie were two of the best platformers on the system and the bear and bird combo became iconic figures in the platforming mascot era. Fans were desperate for what they dubbed 'Banjo-Threeie', and that desire still lingers today.
Before we jump in, we know there are Banjo-Kazooie sequels out there. Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge was a fine attempt at bringing the duo to the GBA. And Nuts & Bolts? Depends on who you ask... Neither of these are Banjo-Threeie in many people's eyes. So leave it to Project Dream, creators of the remastered trailer for Banjo-Kazooie from last year (who have also done one for the sequel), to put its heart, soul, and jiggies into creating a Banjo fan's dream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or just Supermassive mistakes?
2K Games has released an overview trailer giving us a look at its incoming cinematic horror title, The Quarry. The creepy-looking teen adventure is edging ever closer to its June 10 release date, when it will bring a suspiciously familiar tale of camp counselors in peril to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGVj5yMfOgo
Developed by the horror maestros at Supermassive Games, (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology), The Quarry will once again task players with guiding a party of hapless heroes as they attempt to survive a night of fright in a deserted patch of woodland known as "Hackett's Quarry". Stalked and hunted by a sinister, bloodthirsty force, it will be up to you to make the kids' choices for them, in a branching narrative path that will decide each character's ultimate fate.
2K Games is shining a light on the "Hollywood" quality of The Quarry, which uses cutting-edge facial capture and "filmic lighting technology" to present a quality movie-like experience. In addition, The Quarry boasts a recognizable cast of stars including David Arquette (Scream), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Jurassic World), Brenda Song (Dollface), Lance Henriksen (Aliens), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street), and more.
The Quarry launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strictly Limited fun.
Wonder Boy has a convoluted gaming lineage. Initially a platform arcade game featuring a squat caveman-boy in a grass skirt, and developed by Westone (then Escape) for Sega, the sequels quickly splintered off into action role-playing territory. Oddly, there are two chronological entries for Wonder Boy III — Monster Lair (originally an arcade title), and The Dragon’s Trap (originally for the Master System). Compounding the perplexity, the fifth game in the Monster World series is known as Wonder Boy V: Monster World III in Japan, originally released for the Mega Drive. From there, Monster World VI, the sixth entry, was the 16-bit era’s swan song and wasn’t followed up until Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom landed on Nintendo Switch in 2018.
Confused? Let’s continue. Hudson Soft licensed the Wonder Boy IP in 1986, but because Westone had already sold the rights to the name and character to Sega, they renamed their version “Adventure Island”, retaining the same gameplay structure as the original arcade game, while branching out into a new platform series for the NES, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo. Here, the protagonist was remodelled to resemble famous '80s Hudson Soft executive, Takahashi Meijin.

Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

Not many of Nintendo's big franchises skipped the GameCube, but Kirby is one of them. Sort of. Outside of the racing game Kirby Air Ride, the pink puffball didn't get his own mainline game. But Nintendo had intentions to give Kirby his own platformer on the purple lunchbox.
Known simply as Kirby for Nintendo GameCube, the title was announced in 2004 — a year after he'd finished racing on warp stars. The late Satoru Iwata revealed in an interview around the time that Kirby's Return to Dream Land launched that HAL Laboratory had been working on a new Kirby game since 2000, after Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards came out. You can read the interview, which covers three canned Kirby projects, over on Nintendo's website here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It costs more than you’d think".
With the release of Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy — and the upcoming Live A Live and Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake — Square Enix has become synonymous with a new style of retro-inspired visuals. Combining rich HD 3D backdrops with SNES-inspired pixel art characters and monsters, HD-2D's colour palette, lighting, and beautifully detailed boss sprites have helped create a nostalgic, beloved art style that fans want to see more of.
In a recent interview with 4Gamer, Triangle Strategy producers Tomoya Asano and Yasuaki Arai sat down to discuss just how they implemented these retro-style visuals to their recent strategy game. One interesting question to jump out of the interview — translated by Jarop for Nintendo Everything — is when 4Gamer asks Asano why other studios haven't tried using HD-2D. More and more indie studios have embraced pixel art to capture the heart of the games that they've been inspired by, but Asano has quite a simple answer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in Town
Fans have spotted new artwork for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II on the Steam dashboard, suggesting that Activision's billion-dollar shooter franchise may be returning to Valve's popular PC storefront.
It has been seven long years since Call of Duty was last available to purchase and play via the Steam platform, last seen in the form of 2017's Call of Duty: WWII. Since then, PC Call of Duty players have been confined to playing the first-person-shooter series exclusively through Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net launcher.
The new image of CoD veteran character Ghost, (as spotted by Redditor Kalinine), has led the community to wonder whether this year's entry will finally see the storied Call of Duty franchise make its return to the Steam Store. It should be noted that the artwork in question was mysteriously removed from the storefront soon thereafter. Given that 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard saw a weaker performance that the series typically receives, perhaps Activision is casting its net a little wider this year.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches October 28 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
You can find an abridged timeline of Activision Blizzard's ongoing controversy, investigation, and company response right here.

The Embracer Group is a significant gaming company that is still somewhat under the radar in comparison to other major brands. Previously known as THQ Nordic and operating out of Sweden, it's become the parent organisation for a number of major gaming companies - familiar names that are part of the group include Saber Interactive, Gearbox and Aspyr. It made waves recently by acquiring Crystal Dynamics, Square Enix Montréal and Eidos-Montréal from Square Enix.
It's a significant player in the industry, then, but has recently earned attention for another project - Embracer Games Archive. It seems like an example of a company using its significant resources to pick up a baton normally held my volunteers and non-profit organisations, with a mission to acquire, preserve and share gaming history and culture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Including two never-before-localised titles.
Last week, we got the surprise Switch release of the Neo Geo Pocket Color's Biomotor Unitron — the system's first RPG. Biomotor Unitron joins the likes of Big Bang Pro Wrestling, SNK Gals' Fighters, and Samurai Shodown! 2 (among many others) on the system in representing the classic handheld console. And it seems like Neo Geo fans could be in luck as there may well be many more classic titles on the way.
One of our readers — Durrdevil — got in touch after looking at Biomotor Unitron's files and discovering something pretty interesting hidden inside. Within the game, there's a file listing all the other Neo Geo Pocket Color games so far released, plus some others. Some have already been released elsewhere, like Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999 (which is on the Neo Geo Pocket Selection Vol.1) and Crush Roller (which is part of the Steam release of Vol.1). But there are six more games that haven't been announced and are yet to have seen a rerelease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast Four Word is a clever idea. It's a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter. So if the starting word is AHEM, as it was yesterday, you could change the first letter and enter THEM. 

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

Originally released in 2015, Touken Ranbu is a free-to-play browser game where players take up the role of a Saniwa who has the power to turn historical, mythical, and even a few imaginary swords into pretty boy warriors known as "Touken Danshi". The Danshi are mankind’s greatest weapon against the History Retrograde Army, a group of absurd-looking skeletal bugs that are traveling backward in time to change the course of history. As the Saniwa, it is up to you to protect the historical timeline by sending your Danshi back through previous eras of Japanese history to defeat them, even if it means restoring unquestionably cruel moments from the past.
The game was given an international release just last year, which is when I first became acquainted with it. But …]]></summary>

Hamster has returned to the back catalog of veteran publisher Taito for this week's Arcade Archives entry — so get your brain in gear, as the classic cube-based puzzler Flipull has returned on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1989, before finding its way to a wide variety of home computers and consoles, Flipull, (or "Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game"), is a unique take on block-busting, tile-switching puzzlers of the time, and tasks the player with guiding a cute blob character up and down a ladder, throwing out symbol-covered cubes in order to clear out a horizontal playing field. The aim is to clear out rows of matching cubes, while then finding fresh chains for the spare cubes that are left behind. your only enemies are the clock, and some often dizzying background imagery.
This gameplay is better demonstrated in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro MGV.

When I first saw Flipull referenced as this week's Arcade Archives release, I had no idea what it was, but once I realized that it was renamed "Plotting" in the west, the memories came flooding back. I certainly remember Plotting, (and Taito's very similar tile-matcher, Puzznic), from my early gaming years. The cute puzzler is one of those gaming memories that remains locked away in the subconscious until a familiar flyer, magazine advert, or box art image magically opens up some long-discarded file in the brain. It's good to see it again after all of these decades.
Flipull is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Remember in 2019, before the pandemic, when we cruised around in rocket cars? No. Well, Out Run 2019 is here to remind you of those good times.
In all seriousness, I love Out Run. It was a great arcade title with a terrific sense of speed and a relaxing atmosphere. In the Sega Ages release, you can even turn off traffic, which brings about an even better sense of stress relief. After all, Out Run was more about driving than it was about racing. Get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and hit the open road.
There were many spin-offs to Out Run. Some of them were pretty strange, such as Out Run Europa. Out Run 2019 is one game on Sega Genesis that took the concept to a strange new place: the unimaginably distant future! It’s also probably my fav…]]></summary>

      <p>Nintendo has revealed a sneak peek at an upcoming music track from Splatoon 3. Nintendo describes "Sea Me Now" by in-universe band Front Roe as having "a melodious, punkish sound" that has been "swimming up the charts in Splatville lately." True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon's soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.</p>

<p>You can listen to "Sea Me Now" by Front Roe below.</p>

<p>The Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to&nbsp;Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don't know who the figurehead announcers&nbsp;of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.</p>

<p>Splatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9. For more on what this third entry in the franchise brings to the battlefield, check out the latest gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/22/splatoon-3-gets-september-launch-date-in-new-gameplay-trailer">here</a> or learn about its improvements on the series' wave-based cooperative mode, Salmon Run: Next Wave, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2022/02/09/splatoon-3-gets-cooperative-mode-salmon-run-next-wave">here</a>.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we'd like to announce the next season officially.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Season six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to&nbsp;create an installment of&nbsp;another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or "Stylish Action"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of…]]></summary>

I have a history with Total Recall on NES. Not only has it been frequently trashed by everyone I’ve ever looked up to, but it also soured my early retro gaming experience. We had an NES growing up, but my family sold it for an SNES while I was still too young to care. I reacquired one when I was a teenager and it came with potentially the worst assortment of games I could have started with: Kid Icarus, Castlevania 2, and Total Recall. It would be years later that Punch-Out!! and River City Ransom would teach me that not every game on the system would make me feel like peeling my skin off.
I’m not very familiar with the movie, Total Recall. I’ve seen glimpses of it, but mostly I just know that there’s a woman in it with three tits. The fact that I know thi…]]></summary>

HELLO I HAVE RETURNED! I had to take a beat last week, but I'm really glad to be back again in the swing of things tonight. Name of the game is: Pathologic! You've probably heard of it if you're into creepy role-playing survival games, à la Amnesia type stuff.

Made in 2005 and updated with an HD version 10 years later, it's been described to me as "Dark Souls but it hates you and everybody dies." The player's "only necessary goal" is to survive to the end of 12 days by maintaining resources. So... let's try to keep other NPCs alive, stay alive ourselves, and see what this heavily requested game is all about!
See you on stream!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No more awkward post-fight goodbyes
A new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.
Yes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.
Shown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8
The mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.
The Fellowship of the Elden Ring
It's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.
Of course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.
It's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.

The 2018 reboot of the God of War series was a huge game for Sony. It was pretty much universally praised, won plenty of Game of the Year awards, and sold a butt load of units. Kratos has become one of the faces of the PlayStation brand, and rightfully so — even before the reboot, God of War was considered one of the best game series of all time.
Now fans are thrilled to have that legacy continue, because the next entry in the franchise, God of War Ragnarok, is finally getting ready for its 2022 release, which fans were unsure it was going to be able to meet. After a recent video of studio head Cory Barlog apologizing that Sony Santa Monica didn't have anything new to show fans, there were concerns that there was another delay on the horizon, after the game was …]]></summary>

      <p>Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums)&nbsp;until posting the following message:&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</p>
— Team Fortress 2 (@TeamFortress) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2022</a></blockquote>


TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.

<p>Valve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company&nbsp;to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans.&nbsp;Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.</p>]]></summary>

I have a serious soft-spot for Jajamaru-Kun. It was Jaleco’s almost-classic series of games. None were all that great, but they tried their little hearts out. 1986’s Jajamaru no Daibouken was the second game in the series (third if you count Ninja-Kun). Super Mario Bros. dominated the previous year, so for the sequel, Jaleco decided to change the formula to be more of a side-scrolling platformer.
1986 was the year that Metroid and Castlevania hit the scene. Next to them, Jajamaru no Daibouken is pretty embarrassing. It’s an obvious attempt to keep up with the pack but makes so many mistakes that it’s not batting in the same league. Despite that, it’s everything I love about plumbing the Famicom library. It’s unique, it’s blatantly Japanese, and it seems to e…]]></summary>

There was a time when the idea of faithfully adapting a first-person shooter for mobile phones was the stuff of a madman's dream, and yet, with each passing generation, developers become more and more adept at taking the visually-demanding, resource-heavy genre and plonking it down onto tiny, four-inch screens. Case in point, Electronic Arts' Apex Legends Mobile, which launched on iOS and Android just last week.
It would be easy to assume that the large, open-plan maps and pinpoint accuracy required for the sci-fi shooter would put it well out of mobile jurisdiction. But developer Respawn Entertainment has done just that, capturing the essence of the console editions and translating it to the old dog 'n' bone. It seems that the playerbase w…]]></summary>

The secret is already out, as Diablo Immortal is no longer a mobile exclusive. Starting now you can even trigger up a Diablo Immortal PC pre-load, and be ready for the June 2 launch while you peruse a new blog post that showcases a ton of details for what happens next week.

The post is fairly comprehensive, offering up full launch times, as well as all of the controllers that the game will support (the big ones are the Xbox One controllers and DualShock 3-4, as well as the DualSense — and the Switch Pro Controller in wired form or wirelessly via "Mayflash Magic NS").
Globally, the game will launch at 1PM ET on June 2, but the full global release calendar can be seen above (and again, Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now). The team reiterates that there are eight zones, as well as the following classes playable in the launch build: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, or Wizard.
It'll feature cross-progression, so long as you log into your Battle.net account, which allows you to carry over progress from PC to mobile devices. Finally, here are the minimum and recommended PC requirements (with a note that "ultra" settings are only available on PC, or select iPad devices):
Minimum Requirements For PC
Operating System: Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)
CPU: AMD FX-8100 or Intel Core i3
GPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 460, ATI Radeon™ HD 6850 or Intel® HD Graphics 530

It's been a long, long time, but we're now only a short month away from the launch of Nexon's plucky underdog fighter DNF Duel. Following on from an array of character trailers and a semi-successful beta test, the great-looking punchfest will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.
To help keep the fans' hype fires stoked, Nexon released a short new trailer taking a look at the title's single-player options. Those of you who don't feel like throwing down with friends or strangers in rollback-based online matches will instead be able to lock horns with the CPU in Free Battle (essentially Offline Vs.), Arcade Mode, in which your chosen character takes on a series of player-chosen opponents, and Survival, where you can test your mettle against an endless run of enemies, cashing out your score for a variety of health, damage, and meter buffs between fights.
These all seem like mighty fine ways to get acquainted with DNF Duel's exciting roster of characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY1H30c_TdA&t
In addition to the above modes, it should be noted that DNF Duel also includes its own individual Story Mode, which uses comic book-style panels and a rotational cast of characters to tell a new chapter in the Dungeon Fighter Online universe. Once you've held your own in these offline battles, I would not be surprised if you do not have a potential main character or two and will perhaps be getting ready to step up to plate for one of DNF Duel's rollback netcode-powered showdowns.
DNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. And while you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.
Who you got?

        <updated>2022-05-27T17:40:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few minor fixes just came out
A new N64 on Switch patch was recently released alongside of Kirby 64, and some sneaky dataminers have managed to once again uncover some invisible patch notes. Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.
Over on Twitter, Switch "tinkerer" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled "version 2.3.0:"
Kirby 64 added
Star Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.
Dr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)
Mario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).
In short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, "Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks."
With that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.
[Update: Nintendo has acknowledged the Kirby 64 issue in a recent tweet, calling it a "bug that can prevent players progressing under a certain condition." The patch is scheduled to arrive "early next week." For Nintendo, this is a pretty fast response!]

The SNES Nintendo Switch Online offerings just got a little more lively this week, as Nintendo just did a customary late-night content drop that involves three more retro games (two SNES, one NES). There are no Expansion Pack offerings (Genesis/N64) this week.
Following a maintenance announcement that most certainly tipped folks off that more games would be coming, Nintendo unleashed three new games into the mix:
Congo's Caper (SNES)
Rival Turf (SNES)
Pinball (NES)
Pinball will likely trigger some nostalgia, but it's been far surpassed in the arena — despite being one of the first home console pinball games in 1984 (just five years later we'd get Pinball Quest). Rival Turf is a serviceable beat 'em up that's part of the Rushing Beat saga, and joins the already existing Brawl Brothers on the Switch Online service.
But Congo's Caper is the real star here of the weekly SNES Switch Online drops, at least for me. I remember renting it because of a gaming magazine feature, and I couldn't be happier. As one of many "dinosaur/prehistoric"-angled games of that era (and the preceding NES generation), it had a vibrant visual style that still sticks out; a wild plotline involving demon kidnappers; and a protagonist that evolves and devolves from a monkey to a boy as part of the gameplay (similar to Ghosts'N Goblins).
Alongside of a good platforming foundation, the stark aesthetic style and goofy premise will still hold up today for a lot of people: give it a shot!

It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by <em>Shameless</em> star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 3 through June 20
Final Fantasy XIV's Make it Rain Gold Saucer event kicks off very soon, and will last the better part of June 2022 when it does.
As another seasonal event, this one will let players unlock the "show left" and "show right" emotes, which will come in handy during a raid post-win photo session. The gist is that during the runtime, you'll get 50% extra MGP rewards from the Gold Saucer, and some prizes are available for cheaper: "The Crystal Tower striker, Monster Toss machine, Cuff-a-Cur machine, and a number of other prizes may be purchased at a reduced MGP cost from the campaign attendant. In addition, certain items available during previous iterations of the event can be obtained from the same vendor."
In short, it's a way to get people to head back to the Gold Saucer. It'll run from June 3, 2022 at 1AM PT through June 20, 2022 at 7:59AM PT. This follows the previous Maiden's Rhapsody event, which was a crossover with Final Fantasy XI, and ended on May 18. There's always something going on, even if it's a repeat!

Where to start Final Fantasy XIV's Make it Rain event:
Head to Ul'dah - Steps of Nald, and find Ollier at X:9.4, Y:9.2

The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word that comes to mind is "slick". In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

But none stood out quite like Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos, a third-person fighting adventure set in a punk-fantasy universe. Despite only the briefest of hands-on sessions cut short by sod's law, I simply can't shake the game from my short back and sides-furnished skull.

Namely, SteamOS 3.2 tweaks the Deck’s fan curve to make it quieter (especially under light load), and adds the option to set the screen’s refresh rate anywhere between 40Hz and 60Hz – potentially saving battery life in exchange for a lower frames-per-second ceiling.

Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.</p>

      <p>The first season of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/01/26/this-weeks-the-book-of-boba-fett-holds-a-surprise-for-star-wars-video-game"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a> almost transformed into the third season of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/12/05/the-mandalorian-should-be-a-video-game"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>, so we haven't been away from Grogu, Luke Skywalker, and Din Djarin for too long. The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. <em>The Mandalorian</em>'s third season won't hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. </p>

<p>This news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series' creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of <em>Ahsoka</em> to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.</p>

<p>Filoni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. </em>This Disney Plus show is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will star Jude Law. It's yet another project touched by Favreau and Filoni and also has Jon Watts and Christopher Ford serving as executive producers. You can see the official teaser image below:</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to make a bunch of jokes about Two Point Campus in the vein of, "A nudist knight and a wizard studying the dark arts? Sounds like my freshman year!" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, "You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

      <p>Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.</p>

<p>The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/20/hello-there-obi-wan-kenobi-joins-fortnite-next-week">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.</p>

<p>Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.</p>

<p>If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.</p>

<p>If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

      It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck only had a few weeks of getting to know Final Fantasy XIV before the latter’s 6.08 update wrenched them apart. In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

Reddit user Sagezu was flummoxed by the bug over the weekend and shared their woe at crashing out of Lost Ark’s first Legion Raid, Valtan, which arrived as part of the May update. Judging by the comments, many other Lost Ark players were encountering the same bug.

When fully in the grips of My Time At Sandrock, my little made-up computer game life is all I can think about. My relationships with real humans fade into the background, to be replaced by an altogether more fulfilling kind of relationship, one based entirely on gifting the same jar of honey to a cartoon character over and over again until they admit that they love me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

Not that Battlefield 2042's website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
