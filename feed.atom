Game developers saw the potential Star Wars had in the video games realm from the moment the film debuted on the silver screen in 1977. Some of these creators were so certain this science-fiction universe would transition to the interactive space that they didn't even get the rights for the Star Wars property, but still decided to release their games. In 1978,…]]></summary>

Interactive Entertainment joined in on the festivities with Lego Star Wars DLC announcements, and now Hasbro is giving us a look at what is coming next in Star Wars action figures and collectibles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["With 3DS, we did not let the poor sales performance linger".
When the 3DS launched it had a tough task as the successor to DS, a portable family of systems that had become Nintendo's greatest success story. Though the 3DS (and 2DS) range of systems couldn't hit those heights, by the end of its run it had been a reasonable success with 75.94 million hardware units shipped.
If you cast your mind back to its launch, however, it could have been very different. After a strong initial month as eager fans snapped up systems, sales of the original 3DS dramatically collapsed. As Reggie Fils-Aimé explains in his book, Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo, this put the company under huge pressure. In some territories, it's explained that Nintendo was hit with requests to take back swathes of inventory that couldn't be sold, a process that would have been disastrous at the time. It was this, in part, that led to the extraordinary price-drop within months of the system's launch.

Switch Sports attempts to replicate that magic for a contemporary audience with sleek visuals, minigames that feel distinctive but familiar, and avatar customization coupled with ranked multiplayer.

Either way, you're getting a good deal on a high performance Micro SD card that works surprisingly well* in the Steam Deck versus the built-in SSD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Check out that '90s vibe.
Anbernic has adopted a somewhat strange upgrade path for its devices of late. After the success of the RG351 (which spawned the excellent RG351V), the RG300X and more recent RG552 have perhaps been a little disappointing, and fans are still waiting for a 'true' next-gen handheld from the company.
The $140 Anbernic RG503 isn't that device, and we dare say that it will displease many people as a result. However, in many ways it represents a significant step up for the company and handheld emulation devices in general; it's the first product of this type to boast an OLED panel (made by Samsung, in this case) and also packs in 5GHz Wi-Fi as well; it's also the first Anbernic handheld to be powered by the new Rockchip RK3566 processor.

Blizzard Entertainment has released a new developer blog post detailing Week 1 of the Overwatch 2 beta, including goals, progress, updates on Ranked Mode and queue times, and more. 
Heading into the beta, we already knew about some big changes coming to Overwatch 2. Perhaps the biggest change was the standard drop from 6v6 to 5v5 in PvP modes. Beyond new maps and modes, we also learned that Doomfist will no longer be a damage hero and will instead be a tank, and we previewed some big changes coming to the build of Orisa, too. Right before the start of the Overwatch 2 beta last week, Blizzard also released an FAQ to answer any questions players might have before jumping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The roster for All Elite Wrestling’s upcoming console game AEW Fight Forever got two more additions today. 
Today’s All Elite Arcade stream hosted by AEW stars Evil Uno and Adam Cole revealed models and gameplay for Kris Statlander and former Women’s Champion, Nyla Rose. It also confirmed that referee Aubrey Edwards (who once spoke to us about her career in games and wrestling in this interview) along with other officials will be present in the game. You can watch Statlander and Rose fight it out in the pair of trailers below:




Evil Uno further confirmed the game’s final title and announced it’s coming to PC. Fight Forever had been previously slated for still-unspecified consoles. 
AEW Fight Forever was first announced in November 2020 and is being developed by Yuke’s, the studio behind decades of WWE games. AEW has billed the title as a WWF No Mercy-inspired arcade-style grappler, with that game’s director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita contributing to development. Fight Forever will also have a story mode. Over the last year, AEW Games has slowly revealed the roster via video clips of in-development gameplay. The roster is rumored to consist of around 50 names. Excluding today's additions, the wrestlers officially confirmed so far are:
Chris Jericho
Kenny Omega
Hikaru Shida
Darby Allin
Jungle Boy
Thunder Rosa
The Young Bucks
The game is reportedly scheduled to release sometime this year, with September being the rumored launch window. Neither AEW nor Yuke’s has confirmed a release date.]]></summary>

Wrestling and video games go together pretty perfectly, so it perhaps shouldn't be a surprise when some of the world's most famous wrestling superstars have some strong opinions. However, if there's one wrestler that fans might be surprised to hear talk about video games, it's the legendary Stone Cold Steve Austin.
The Hall of Fame member is now known for hosting the WWE podcast Broken Skull Sessions where he chats with a different guest every week about the wrestling industry. Due to air on 6th May, the next episode features the two-time Intercontinental Championships winner and six-time Tag Team Championships winner Cody Rhodes.

The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wanted to race in a kart racer game by way of propane, Apple Arcade will soon have you covered. 
That’s because Warped Kart Racers is a new kart racer coming to the premium iOS service that will let you race as Hank Hill, lover of all things propane, from King Of The Hill. He’ll be joined by other cartoon characters such as Peter Griffin from Family Guy, as well as Stewie, Stan from American Dad, and more, as first reported by Eurogamer. In fact, Warped Kart Racers will feature five characters from Family Guy, five from American Dad, five from King Of The Hill, and five from Solar Opposites. 
You can check out the Apple Arcade trailer below:


As you can see, it features multiple characters from the TV series mentioned above, and you’ll be able to race around 16 maps as them. It also includes “tons of customizations,” such as different outfits for each character, wheel types, glider types, and more. Plus, you can play with up to eight friends in online multiplayer. 
Warped Kart Racers does not yet have a release date, but the trailer says the game is coming to Apple Arcade this month, so it sounds like you won’t have to wait long to play.

I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

Strike Scoring is based on your time spent in Guardian Games playlists and where you rank, while Strike Medals are won by “pulling off some pretty impressive feats, like taking out a ton of enemies with a fancy little combat jig like Shatter,” so Bungie say.

Revealed on Twitter yesterday, Hitman 3 game director at IO Interactive, Mattias Engström, will direct Crysis 4. He’s wasting no time, too, because Crytek says he begins work on the new first-person shooter this week. 
We are happy to announce that Mattias Engström, known for his work as Game Director for Hitman 3 at IO Interactive, joins the Crysis family as Game Director for the 4th installment in the Crysis franchise, starting this week. pic.twitter.com/hHkOrXIAt6
May 3, 2022
Engström is a great get for Crysis 4, especially considering how well Hitman 3 turned out. You can read our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Hitman 3 review to find out why we gave it a 9 out of 10. If you haven’t yet played Hitman 3, you should, and if you’re excited about Crysis 4, you can play through the first three games in the Crysis Remastered Trilogy.

After all, Star Wars is never really gone.

This week has brought the launch of Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo by Reggie Fils-Aimé, a business leadership book from the former Nintendo of America President that offers plenty of interesting insights. While it's selective and careful about detail it gives around Nintendo's operations, one theme that develops nicely in the book is the evolving relationship between Fils-Aimé and the late Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata.
Iwata-san was hugely respected, of course, and 2021's Iwata Asks book is well worth a look for direct insights from his career. In Fils-Aimé's case we see the influence that Iwata-san had on his approach to business, and indeed to life more broadly. It is clear that a strong friendship formed, as outlined in very touching early sections outlining visits to see Iwata-san when he was ill and recovering in hospital, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Disney Plus series hitting the service on May 27, follows the titular character following the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. A new trailer provides another look at the trials Obi-Wan will face, including confronting his former apprentice. 
Kenobi is on the run, looking to find, protect, and train Luke Skywalker, son of his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker. He must also find refuge away from the Inquisitors, an Imperial group of elite soldiers looking to find him and kill the remaining Jedi. It looks like it’s going to be a great time, both as a new story in the Star Wars universe and as a return to beloved characters like Ewan McGregor’s Kenobi and Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker turned Darth Vader. 

We get a glimpse at both Vader and the Inquisitors, as well as new looks at Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, his uncle, and more in a new trailer released by Disney today to celebrate Star Wars Day. You can check it out below: 


As you can in the trailer, the Inquisitors are on the hunt and they won’t stop until they can bring Kenobi to their master, Darth Vader. And speaking of Vader, we get a quick glimpse of him putting on the pieces of his iconic suit right at the end. Here’s hoping he’s suiting up for Kenobi vs. Skywalker Round 2 because that’s something we really want to see. 
To accompany the trailer, Disney has also released a new poster for Obi-Wan Kenobi that features both the titular character and Darth Vader and it's very dope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's (ahem) rad!
Since TVs shifted into the glorious realm of HD, there's been a bit of a battle going on in the world of retro gaming. Relying on RGB output was arguably the most sensible way of extracting the best possible picture from your consoles in the CRT-filled '90s, but that isn't always the case now (in fact, many modern TV sets have removed connections like SCART entirely, and those that do have them rarely handle the analogue signal well).
This has opened up the door for a wide range of AV solutions for retro gamers, including upscalers like the OSSC, RetroTINK2x and Framemeister (which, on a basic level, take the analogue signal and turn it into something your modern TV can play nicely with, and they do a pretty amazing job) as well as cheaper, 'plug and play' cable options – most of which have historically offered less-than-stellar results. Until now, that is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is May 4, which means it’s Star Wars day, and to celebrate the occasion, TT Games is releasing two new character packs for its latest game, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. 
More specifically, characters from The Mandalorian and Star Wars: The Bad Batch will hit the game today. In total, these two character packs bring 10 new playable Lego-fied characters to The Skywalker Saga.


For the uninitiated, The Bad Batch is a spin-off of The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian is a sci-fi western that centers on a very Boba Fett-like Mandalorian whose job is to protect a young member of Yoda's race (AKA "Baby Yoda"). If you haven’t yet watched Season 2 of The Mandalorian, you should try to avoid today’s DLC because the characters from the new Mandalorian pack are based on Season 2 of the Disney Plus series. 
“Warner Bros. Games celebrates Star Wars Day with the launch of two new DLC packs for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga – The Mandalorian Season 2 and Star Wars: The Bad Batch,” a press release reads. “The Mandalorian Season 2 pack will include Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand, and Moff Gideon. Star Wars: The Bad Batch character pack will linclude Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo.”
If you own the Character Collection Pack for the game, you’ll receive both of today’s packs as well as the packs based on Season 1 of The Mandalorian, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Classic Characters, the Trooper Pack, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. You can also purchase each pack individually. 

TT Games says Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which was released just last month, holds the record for the biggest Lego game launch ever. You can read Game Informer’s review of the game here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Send in the Toaplanes.
M2’s ShotTriggers series has been an ongoing pilgrimage of preservation for some of the greatest shoot-em-up’s in arcade history. Hishou Same! Same! Same! combines an early Toaplan series of two: Hishouzame and Same! Same! Same!, known in the West as Flying Shark and Fire Shark, respectively. Both original arcade titles are presented here with a variety of modes, correctly maintained aspect ratios, screen settings, and a library of bonus features and options to tinker with. Regional variations are also present, since they have slight alterations in overall difficulty. After an initially long load, the opening menu screen blasts you like a Van Halen power ballad with a terrific arrange of Flying Shark’s ‘Against The Attack’ — regrettably unavailable as an in-game audio option.
Flying Shark (1987) and its sequel, Fire Shark (1989), are quasi-World War themed shoot-em-ups, sending up biplanes with hefty ordnance against futuristic, cannon-bristled tanks, battleship-patrolled seas, enemy bases and muted mountain ranges. Graphically, these titles are a product of their time, and all the more endearing for it, peppered with land-based details like runway strip airmen pointing you to glory, or the trailing plane that crashes on take-off, its pilot lying inert in a smouldering pit.

I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

Many Switch owners have likely been destroying relationships with their friends and family this past weekend, attempting to beat them at tennis or bowling in Nintendo Switch Sports. The family-friendly game launched last week, and players have been getting together to try the game both offline and online.
However, the online mode might not be quite as family-friendly as people were expecting. Players have reported seeing disturbingly inappropriate usernames — none of which we're going to share here — that reference all manner of uncomfortable topics. Nintendo Switch Sports has a name filtering system to catch bad language already, but many have managed to circumnavigate this.

It was meant to launch this year, but the game’s already been delayed indefinitely once before.

You'll have been seeing a lot of Reggie Fils-Aimé on the internet this week, following the release of his book Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo. Though primarily a business leadership book, there are interesting insights into his life, career and his years with Nintendo.
Another angle picked up, this time by VGC, relates to the launch of the Game Boy Micro. This came relatively early in Fils-Aimé's time at the company, when he was executive vice president of sales and marketing. As a device it was desired by enthusiast fans because of its looks, but the market reality was that its tiny size didn't make it a practical way to comfortably play games, and the Game Boy Advance was already being replaced by the DS.

Idea Factory International's upcoming visual novel is a bit of a crossover between Romeo & Juliet and Twelfth Night mixed in with some traditional visual novel tropes. You take on the role of Shanao, the youngest known surviving male heir to the Genji clan. Except Shanao isn't a man; she was instead raised as a boy after her father's murder. Shanao must choose between her duty to uphold her family name and overthrow the Heike clan and her own happiness.

Not so, says Gilbert. On the subject of his previous comments, he says "None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody."

In September of 2020, Ubisoft announced that it was remaking The Sands of Time, this time with Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai handling development. Originally set to release in January of 2021, Ubisoft revealed toward the end of 2020 that the remake had been delayed two months. Just three months later, Ubisoft announced that The Sands of Time was delayed indefinitely and that’s when fans began to wonder what was going on with this remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech G502 Hero is the most popular gaming mouse on the market, not to mention the RPS reader's choice and our current 'best gaming mouse overall' - so it's exciting news that it's going cheap on Amazon UK today. 
£29.99 is the cheapest we've ever seen this mouse, beating out last year's Black Friday price, and it's also 63% off its UK RRP. That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. 
If you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year.

Blizzard Entertainment has pulled back the curtains on its rumored Warcraft mobile game, revealing that it’s called Warcraft Arclight Rumble and features an “extensive single-player campaign, co-op play, and PvP.” 
Unveiled today in a new cinematic trailer that you can watch below, Warcraft Arclight Mobile is a strategy game coming to iOS and Android devices in select regions later this year. Blizzard says it’s been designed from the ground up for mobile devices, and it’s set in the Warcraft universe. As the trailer below reveals, it seems like Warcraft Arclight Rumble is an arcade game of sorts that heroes and villains in the Warcraft universe play in pubs and the like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After coming out of the gates with a bang, Halo Infinite has seen its share of quiet months. Some events have kept players coming back, but fans have been left wanting for some time now. Hopefully, that all changes today as Halo Infinite Season 2 is here, and we're streaming the fun live starting at 2 p.m. CT over on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Join Game Informer Halo fan Alex Stadnik as he hops back into developer 343 Industry's latest title to go hands-on with all the new additions. One of the main draws of the new season comes from the two new play spaces fans will slay each other upon. First up is Catalyst, a smaller arena map that is visually reminiscent of past combat zones such as Guardian from Halo 3. Big Team Battle fans aren't to be forgotten, as they too will be getting a map to wreak havoc on in Breaker. This Banished ship-breaking yard is a sprawling molten space where players will have to carefully avoid some of the lava pitfalls on their way to securing the Gravity Hammer.
New maps aren't the only addition in Season 2, though. Fans will finally get new modes to try out in the form of Land Grab, Last Spartan Standing, and the classic King of the Hill. On top of that, there are more narrative and special events, a sparkling new battle pass, and a more fully fleshed-out version of the multiplayer 343 hoped to release last year. But will it be enough to keep Halo fans happy? You'll just have to join us on today's stream to find out!
If you are enjoying our Twitch streams, be sure to subscribe to the channel to know the second we go live and to gain access to our Discord channel. On top of special shows like today, we also stream every Thursday and Friday to check out the latest new game and celebrate the past with Replay, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Prime is an upcoming animated Netflix series that was first announced in February 2021. We haven’t heard much of a peep about it since, and though we’re still waiting for a proper trailer, a new promotional video provides the first glimpse of the show. 
Netflix released a trailer montage promoting its upcoming slate of kid-friendly animated shows. Sonic Prime pops up at the very end, with Sonic sprinting and collecting rings across Green Hill Zone. Sonic also speaks, giving fans the first sample of voice actor Deven Mack’s performance. You can catch the clip at the 1:49 mark. 


Unfortunately, Sonic Prime still doesn't have a premiere date. We only know that the show consists of 24 episodes and centers on Sonic fighting to save a multiverse from supposed doom. Netlfix's official description of the series pegs it as a "journey of self-discovery and redemption." Other cast members include Ashleigh Ball, Shannon Chan-Kent, Brian Drummond, Vincent Tong, Ian Hanlin, Kazumi Evans, and Adam Narada. 
It’s a great time to be Sonic the Hedgehog. His second theatrical film had the best opening weekend of any video game movie in history, a third film has already been greenlit, and another animated show spun-off from those movies is coming to Paramount+. He’s also got two games slated for 2022. Sonic Origins, a remastered bundle of classic Sonic games, arrives in June, while Sonic Frontiers, the hedgehog’s first open-world adventure, releases later this year.]]></summary>

Like a shorter Black Friday, this can be a good opportunity to pick up some PC gaming hardware at severely slashed prices, so if you’re currently weighing up a new SSD or replacement mouse then it may be prudent to hold off until the event gets underway. And you might not even need to shop at Amazon for it, as some rival retailers like to run their own deals to compete with Prime Day directly.

He is not my favourite character in Citizen Sleeper but he is the one who best represents it. In one scene he explains his deep anti-capitalist reasoning to you. Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.
Throwing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run. Even when the game's own systems of dice and clocks clash with its stories of human interest, it is the people who come out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OverBorder studio has announced a new release date for its action RPG Thymesia, which had been delayed out of its original December 2021 launch. Curious players can take control of the world’s deadliest plague doctor on August 9.
That’s not all, as the news is accompanied by a new trailer and the launch of a Steam demo. You can play Thymesia beginning today and up until Monday, May 9. If this is your first exposure to Thymesia, it was first revealed last March and stars Corvus, a plague doctor with the ability to siphon diseases from adversaries and fashion these illnesses into weapons. Schythes, swords, and daggers are among the killing instruments he can wield in fast-paced combat reminiscent of Dark Souls and Ninja Gaiden. 


Thymesia is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

After loading the machine, filling my powder, and carefully selecting then starting my cycle, I watched through the door for 12 minutes as my washing sloshed and spun. And then I watched another players's washing in disgust. Visiting this laundry simulation has made me realise I have strong opinions on how other people run their imaginary washes. You wouldn't believe the laundry crimes I've seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of Shenmue III seemed like a long shot. Eighteen years passed between the latest entry and Shenmue II. For almost two decades, fans were unsure if their favorite brawler would ever return. Then the seemingly impossible happened: Yu Suzuki's Shenmue III Kickstarter campaign amassed more than $7 million and over 69,000 backers. The third chapter in Ryo Hazuki's revenge quest was released in 2019 to mixed critical reception and performed "fine" financially. Suzuki recently voiced enthusiasm for Shenmue IV but primarily wants the game to be more accessible for newcomers.
According to VGC, Suzuki spoke about Shenmue IV at a special event in Yokosuka, the city where the story takes place. Suzuki said that Shenmue IV was created with longtime fans in mind, which might've inadvertently alienated newer players. Despite being satisfied with overall reactions to the game, Suzuki felt that it wasn't a good entry point. Currently, there are "no concrete plans" for Shenmue IV, but Suzuki wants to make sure that it can appeal to a broader audience.
"With Shenmue 3, I really responded to the fans’ voices, so I wasn’t necessarily thinking about making any money,” Suzuki announced at the event. “But since I’m running a company, I have to think about what can sell if I continue. I’ve been seriously talking about it over and over again.” 
Publisher Deep Silver's parent company, Embracer Group, released a statement about Shenmue III's financial success in 2020 during an earnings presentation. CEO Lars Wingefors stated that the third game was a "core niche product." 
There are no confirmed development plans for Shenmue IV. Even so, Suzuki has stated an interest in continuing the series. In other news, Square Enix sold Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal, And More, Including Tomb Raider IP, To Embracer Group.

Billed as a union between Soulslikes and Tetris, Loot River delivers this intriguing combination with style. Every moment swings between slick puzzle-solving and smooth action. Players should expect to continually die in Loot River’s darkly atmospheric levels, with each death setting you back to square one. However, the thrilling gameplay and rippling pixel art make it hard to resist one more run.

Like in years past, this year’s May the 4th celebration in Epic Games’ battle royale will bring lightsabers, stormtroopers, new cosmetics, and more to the game. However, the Star Wars celebration won’t encompass just tomorrow because Fortnite is keeping its Star Wars content in the game for two weeks until May 17.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Garden Path appeared just about a year ago, a sort of slightly more complex-looking Animal Crossing. Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through. There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.
There's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.

Thanks to the music he created for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, alongside his mentor of six years, Mark Mothersbaugh, he’s now an official American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers awards winner. 
That’s because Hokoyama has received the Video Game Score of the Year award for Rift Apart by way of the 2022 ASCAP Screen Music Awards. Of course, Mothersbaugh helped create the score as well, but he’s not with ASCAP, so the award, on paper, goes to Hokoyama alone. In a new interview with Game Informer, though, the composer, who also has credits on Thor: Ragnarok, Resident Evil 5, Knack, Halo Wars 2 and Halo 2: Anniversary, and more, said winning this award wouldn’t have bee…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As 2022 continues to be the year of acquisitions, with news that Square Enix is selling Embracer Group three of its western development studios and more than 50 IPs, it seems Sony is still looking to bolster its first-party family.
That’s because the company is now hiring for a Corporate Development Director, “responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions,” and more, as discovered by Roberto Serrano’ on Twitter and reported by Video Games Chronicle. It’s not surprising that Sony is looking to hire somebody like this, especially when you look at the current video game landscape – it feels like every other week, a major acquisition is announced. 
“Sony Interactive Entertainment seeks a highly qualified Director, Corporate Development,” Sony’s job listing reads. “SIE’s Corporate Development Team works closely with SIE’s management team and is responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures. The team sources, evaluates, and completes transactions that are aligned with SIE’s strategic priorities and drive significant long-term value for the company.”
Elsewhere in the listing, it says Sony is looking for someone to drive proactive deal sourcing, including developing relationships with external and internal partners. 
News that Sony is looking for what is essentially an acquisitions director is not surprising – acquisitions have largely defined gaming in 2022 thus far. It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, the following week, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion. Two weeks after that, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie for $3.6 billion and later announced it had acquired Jade Raymond’s new studio, Haven Studios.

Between memes, jokes, and more, the controller has gained a touch of infamy online, and now, one Elden Ring player has modded it to be playable on PC, as reported by The Verge. Going even further, they’ve played Elden Ring using it. Controller modder Rudeism (on Twitter) posted a clip yesterday of him using this modded controller to play Elden Ring and while that alone is impressive, what makes it better is that the Fisher-Price controller still lights up and makes all the sounds it usually does. 
here's the Fisher Price Xbox controller in action!
@Wario64 for the off-hand joke that inspired me to make this happen 😂 pic.twitter.com/3OETvcsEsI
May 1, 2022
As you can see in the video above, it’s quite a hilarious mod. As for how fun actually playing Elden Ring with this controller is, well, only Rudeism knows but something tells us it’s going to be a little harder to take down Radahn this way. Imagine dying to Radahn, while he has just a sliver of health left, only to hear a Fisher-Price song begin playing, almost as if to taunt you in your death. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then read about the latest Elden Ring patch, which fixes an infamous Malenia bug. Check out this Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the game’s closed colosseum, where they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies inside.

That’s because Scicluna has created a wonderful digital collection of covers for what-would-be video game comic books, as first spotted by 80LV, and they look absolutely amazing. Ranging from the Crash Bandicoot series, including its kart racing spinoff Crash Team Racing, to Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Resident Evil, and more, these covers are so good we wish the comics were real. Nonetheless, Scicluna’s covers will have to do for now. You can check out a lot of them below: 

If you like those covers, and especially if you like the Crash Bandicoot series, check out Scicluna’s collection of Crash comic covers:

If you’re interested in purchasing any of these covers, you can do so on Scicluna’s RedBubble page. You can follow Scicluna on Twitter and Instagram for more art, too.

Last summer’s challenging action game Eldest Souls gets a beefy – and free – expansion today called Depths of the Forgotten. The update treats fans and newcomers alike to three new locations, each housing a powerful boss waiting to be conquered. Additionally, the expansion introduces a new Boss Shard (with 12 infusions), four new weapons, weapon customization, and additional lore bits to further flesh the story.

Embracer Group is paying $300 million for these studios and associated IPs and it's doing it on a “cash and debt-free basis, to be paid in full at closing,” according to the company. In total, this acquisition will result in roughly 1100 employees from these three studios, across eight locations around the world, becoming Embracer Group employees. This purchase is expected to close during the second year of Embracer’s 2022-23 financial year, or in other words, sometime between July and September of this year.

Kupříkladu jak vdechnout 30 let starým digitálkám nový život náhradní elektronikou, logický analyzátor z RP2040, kde sehnat učebnice programování STM32 v češtině, nové pluginy pro KiCAD nebo jak odemknout naprogramované ATtiny, pokud jde o vážná témata.

Z kategorie úsměvných může působit například ezonávod na opravu LED žárovky na webu zabývajícím se (možná poněkud "alternativním") zdravím, trollení majitelů Tesel otevíráním "palivových" víček na dálku nebo sluchátkové zesilovače s elektronkovým koncovým stupněm, kterému předchází osmijádrový procesor XMOS.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 2. května od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později).

        <updated>2022-04-30T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing the second game in Supergiant's catalog, Transistor.
Released for PlayStation 4 on May 18, 2014, and PC a day later, Transistor was a very different game for Supergiant to make compared to its freshman effort a few years prior. Development started just a few months following the release of Bastion, and while its first game was a success, the tight-knit studio wanted to prove what it did wasn't lightning in a bottle. In this episode, we discuss the various ways Supergiant pushed against the ever-present shadow of Bastion in the games design and the studio's production methods. We also cover the process of creating a new retro-inspired cyberpunk setting, the unique tactical action combat, and how the studio landed on a voiceless lounge singer named Red and her talking sword, the Transistor, as the main characters.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Magazine Content Director Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Transistor! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

That's what the time limited Knockout Bash mode does, which is available from now until May 10th.

Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

They’re a week late to celebrate Shakespeare’s birthday, but I won’t judge because I can’t even add up properly in Freddos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just superb.
I'm not a fan of most fighting games. All too often they have too many elaborate moves, too much memory testing, or they feel like glorified puzzles you have to figure out the one solution to.
Hats Are Not Allowed takes an approach I find far more interesting. Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can't say it's one of the best dueling games ever, but it's the best one I've played for ages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of 12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford’s Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It’s mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don’t need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you’re greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won’t see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you’ll have to go elsewhere.

Oddly enough, Yoshida’s reveal about the development of FFXVI doesn’t come by way of any usual channels like Twitter, a press release, or a development update video. Instead, it comes by way of a new Yoshida interview in a free magazine currently being given away at Uniqlo stores in Japan, as discovered by Twitter user alverich_ff14 and translated by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If, at any point, while playing through the Mass Effect series, you’ve thought to yourself, “I really wouldn’t mind a replica of the Reaper Sovereign ship,” then today’s your day. 
That’s because BioWare and Dark Horse Direct have unveiled a new 14-inch Reaper Sovereign ship replica, and it’s beautiful. What’s more, it’s available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it’s something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don’t have to wait too long to have it in your hands. 

“Reaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,” Dark Horse’s description reads. “This spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.” 
Gentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA’s Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect. 
Are you going to pick up one of these replica Reaper ships? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Nearly a year later, Young Horses, the game’s developer, announced during a Sony State of Play the game would be getting a new DLC. Called The Isle of Bigsnax, the expansion will be free for players who already own the base game. On top of a fresh story, which should take three to five hours to complete according to the creators, fans can expect a slew of new content. And while it’s aiming to release in the first half of 2022, we got an early hands-on look at the game at GDC.
Adding hours of playtime to the original game, Young Horses announced players would receive their own in-game dwelling to renovate. Now you can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The indie moniker describes a game made by independent creators, i.e., those not under the umbrella of a major publisher. That could mean anything from a solo developer working on a debut title to critically acclaimed teams releasing self-published works. While these games have been around as long as the industry, their popularity surged in the early 2000s. This was partly due to new digital distribution and crowdfunding options, which presented opportunities for some would-be game makers.
Though many of gaming’s best-loved indies belong to this early era, independently made games reached a whole new level of mainstream attention in the following decades. There are so many launching every day now it can be difficult to keep up. So to help, this list explores the most recent titles that hav…]]></summary>

Now, Naka has taken to Twitter to reveal that not only was he removed as the director of Balan Wonderworld about half a year before its release in March of 2021, but that he has also filed a lawsuit against the game’s publisher, Square Enix, for doing so. He says now that proceedings are over and he’s no longer bound by company rules, he’s speaking out about what happened to him, as translated by Twitter user Cheesemeister3K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is the next title in the franchise. 
Surprising nobody, especially considering that the company had previously revealed that this year’s Call of Duty would be a sequel to 2019’s Call of Duty Modern Warfare reboot, a new teaser dropped on Twitter today revealed not just the title, but the logo for this sequel, too.
coverage here.

You can check it out below:
The new era of Call of Duty is coming. #ModernWarfare2 pic.twitter.com/HMtv2S6Nlz
April 28, 2022
As you can see, there’s really not much to glean from it. It sounds very Modern Warfare-y and looks very Modern Warfare-y, too, but it doesn’t reveal much about the actual game. Perhaps there’s something to be made out of the muddled voices playing during the trailer, but it’s likely that this teaser is just setting the stage for a bigger reveal in the coming weeks or months. The Call of Duty account that tweeted out the teaser does say, “The new era of Call of Duty is coming,” so perhaps the company believes this game will shake up the franchise in a big way. 
It wouldn’t be surprising because Infinity Ward's 2019 Modern Warfare reboot did just that for the series, especially in its rollout a few months before Call of Duty: Warzone. Plus, 2019’s Modern Warfare is still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty in recent years. With Infinity Ward working on Modern Warfare II, fans are likely excited to see what this sequel looks like. Sadly, there’s no telling when the next look will be but if it’s like Call of Duty reveals in years past, we could be weeks or even days away. Only time will tell.
In the meantime, read about how a sequel to Warzone is expected to drop this year and then check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023. Read Game Informer’s Modern Warfare review after that.

Rogue Legacy 2 has been in early access for a couple of years, building upon its predecessor’s fun – and challenging – roguelite formula. You still control members of a warrior bloodline who must battle through a procedurally generated castle rife with dangers. Every death gives you a new character you can outfit with helpful/strange genetic traits, from dealing increased attack damage to farting every time you perform an action. 
Watch on Twitch!
Look forward to watching a fun stream as I’ll likely be sending an entire generation of warriors to their doom. Our review will arrive in the coming days, so be sure to read our review in progress for editor John Carson’s current thoughts on the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios’ celebrated anti-war game, This War of Mine, is getting revamped and expanded for a re-release on modern consoles.
Dubbed the Final Cut, the game, in which players manage a party of civilians surviving in a war-torn city, is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S –including Xbox Game Pass – on May 10. It boasts a 4K resolution and a readjusted UI. Content-wise, it includes the locations from the base game and introduces a new character, quests, and events. 
Additionally, the three DLC narrative episodes, This War of Mine: Stories, will be available for purchase separately on PS5/XSX. This War of Mine: Complete Edition is a bundle containing Final Cut and Stories if you want everything.  
11 Bit Studios, based in Poland, states that the ongoing Ukraine/Russia conflict is the motivator to re-release This War of Mine and repromote its anti-war messaging to a new group of players. The studio recently raised nearly $700,000 for Ukrainian civilian aid by heavily discounting the previous versions of This War of Mine. 11 Bit CEO Przemek Marszal says in a press release: 
"The message and themes existing inside of This War of Mine have, unfortunately, become brutally vivid and relevant in recent months. We believe it’s especially important to educate people on the realities of war right now, while its horrifying reality has become a daily struggle for people that are close to us. We’re proud that recent This War of Mine fundraising helped us create a wave of spontaneous help for war victims in Ukraine, and we hope we can further spread our antiwar message with This War of Mine: Final Cut.”

Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”

They're a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they'll flower into a roguelike that you won't be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it's something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games’ next foray into horror, The Quarry, the studio’s spiritual successor to Until Dawn, is due out June 10. As we creep closer to the release date, more and more information about the title has come to light. 
Much of that comes by way of IGN, as The Quarry is this month’s feature IGN First game, and in a recent interview with director Will Byles, who also directed Until Dawn, it was revealed that The Quarry has 186 different endings. That’s quite a lot, and it sounds like players will be able to play through The Quarry dozens of times without having the same experience.
Director of The Quarry and Until Dawn, Will Byles from Supermassive Games, tells us how exactly you go about writing a story with 186 unique endings and how the choices you make along the way impact everyth…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year’s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase will take place online on June 12th, Microsoft have announced today via Xbox Wire. The announcement is light on details right now, as you might expect, but there’s the promise of a “diverse line-up of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC”. Personally, I'm hoping we'll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3 too. Here's hoping!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has announced that it will hold a “special event” stream for Monster Hunter Rise next month. 
More specifically, the special event stream will be about the game’s upcoming expansion, Sunbreak, and it will begin at 7 a.m. PT/9 a.m. CT/10 a.m. ET on May 10. It will be streamed on the official Monster Hunter Twitch channel and according to the announcement tweet, will feature “exciting reveals of new gameplay info, monsters, and more.” As for how long it will run, that remains unknown. 


A teaser trailer for this digital event, which you can watch above, reveals a few more tidbits of info. 
“Get ready for a brand new trailer, more monster reveals, much-awaited info about new Hunter actions, and additional game features,” the trailer reads.
As you can expect, director Yoshitake Suzuki will be presenting during the showcase. Not much else was shared about this event but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too much longer to learn more about Sunbreak because the event begins in less than two weeks. 
In the meantime, read about Sunbreak’s confirmed June release date and then check out the previous Sunbreak reveal that highlighted new monsters and locations. Read Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced that an Xbox and Bethesda games showcase will be held this summer. 
More specifically, the showcase will air on June 12, beginning at 10 a.m PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. ET, and will feature “amazing titles coming from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and our partners around the world." 
As for what to expect, the showcase will focus on games that will soon hit Xbox Series X/S consoles and PC. However, these showcases have been known to surprise-reveal new titles early in development, so it wouldn’t be surprising if games with no release date are showcased. 
“The Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase will include everything you need to know about the diverse lineup of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC,” the Xbox Wire post reads. 
Nothing else was revealed besides some links to social and streaming channels where you can watch this showcase. There’s no mention of specific games, the runtime of the event, or anything like that. However, with Starfield set to release on Nov. 11, there’s a good chance we finally get a deeper look at what this game is. Only time will tell, though.

Off your cute wee peglin goes on an adventure, battling baddies and claiming treasures, but damage is dealt by pling-plonging orbs down Peggle/pachinko boards and you have a bag of different orbs instead of cards. I like it, and it has a demo you can try for yourself.

While it's not disputed that 'Destiny 2 Hacks' were offered for sale, the court is not convinced that these are copyright infringing.

I'm too old and thin-skinned to enjoy the competitive nature of most online FPS games, and rallying together a regular squad of buddies to tackle the world of games as a service always seemed too much like hard work. Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I've seen them take hold in friends and family. But with Dorfromantik, the chill, pastoral village builder from Toukana Interactive, I finally understand the journey towards that mythic 'forever' status.

Far: Lone Sails introduced the idea of crafting a ship of questionable quality as it makes its way across a mysterious landscape, and Far: Changing Tides continued those core principles with some fun new twists.
Changing Tides focuses on a seaborne ship that gradually gains new components and features as the player encounters new obstacles. In an especially fitting way to highlight the game’s distinctiveness, the game makers partnered with Aaron Newman, a professional LEGO-building artist, to create a custom LEGO set of the ship seen in the game. Newman was a LEGO Masters USA Season 1 contestant and has since moved on to be a product designer at The LEGO group, though it’s important to note …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland has revealed the patch notes for the upcoming New Game Plus mode patch for Dying Light 2 and it brings some expansive changes to the game, even beyond the new mode. 
Revealed earlier this week, the new patch is now live in Dying Light 2 and New Game Plus should be available to any and all players who have completed the base campaign of the zombie parkour title. As for what to expect in this new mode, there will be new inhibitors to find, new Platinum objectives for parkour challenges, and more. 
“After finishing it once, the game can be replayed again, only this time with modified game parameters in place to encourage a second playthrough by the implementation of a unique system and experience,” the patch notes read. “The player can now go through the story with revitalized mechan…]]></summary>

Some of you have a lot of pent-up frustration because you lack the dexterity to keep your fingers from fumbling photo buttons. But it is decided, and we must move on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corsair make a particularly fine selection of AiOs, also known as all-in-one liquid coolers. They use off-the-shelf designs for their pumps and radiators, as do many other companies, but distinguish themselves with good-quality fans, optional lighting and low prices for a major brand. That last point is particularly pertinent today, as their H100X 240mm AiO has dropped to nearly £60 on Amazon UK - a significantly lower price than any alternative that I'd rate as highly and some £25 below this AiO's original launch price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re looking to add more of the Street Fighter roster to your Fortnite Outfit collection, tomorrow is your chance. That’s because popular fighters Blanka and Sakura hit the Fortnite Item Shop at 8 p.m. EST on Thursday, April 28. 
Announced by Epic Games in a new blog post, World Warriors Blanka and Sakura hit the battle royale to celebrate 35 years of Street Fighter and as is usual with new additions to Fortnite, both characters will come with an Outfit and matching accessories to round out the skin. Plus, the Blanka & Sakura Cup, which will begin as a mobile-only Zero Build Solo Cup starting today before becoming an all-platforms Battle Royale Solo Cup on Thursday, will give top-performing players in different regions the chance to unlock the Bonus Stage Loading Screen. 
The first Outfit is the Blanka Outfit and it includes the Blanka Delgado alt Style, inspired by Rival Schools’ Boman Delgado, too. This Outfit includes a built-in Blanka Backflip Emote and it comes with the Blanka-Chan Back Bling. You can also purchase the Tropical Hazarad Kebab Pickaxe in the Item Shop, too. 

For Sakura, you can pick up the standard Sakura Outfit, and with it, you’ll get the Sakura Gym alt Style inspired by one of her Street Fighter IV alts. The Outfit includes the built-in Sakura’s Victory Sway Emote, too, as well as the Hanakaze Claw Back Bling. You can also purchase the Fighting Tournament Trophy Pickaxe and the Kayari Buta Glider, too. 

For more information about these new Outfits, as well as additional details regarding the upcoming Blanka & Sakura Cup, head to Epic Games' blog post. While waiting for these Street Fighters to hit the game, read about how rapper Emicida is coming to Fortnite this weekend for a concert, and then check out the recently-released Wu-Tang Clan Outfits added to the game. Check out all of the Marvel and DC superheroes added to Fortnite thus far after that.

The appearance of the lower-end Ryzen 5500, 5600 and mid-range 5700X have pushed prices for their more expensive counterparts way down, while the 5800X3D remains hard to find due to its relatively low supply and impressive gaming performance. 
If you were thinking of upgrading, you might be interested to know which retailers in the US and UK are selling each of these processors, and for how much. I was interested myself, so I put together a couple of small spreadsheets to find out - and the results suprised me.

But the game also appeals to a primal, competitive side of me. The one that's desperate to beat my rival Patrick, a bot who's literally programmed to be really good, and Edders, a ghostly version of myself who either strokes my ego or shatters it to pieces.

The update is also dropping for Call of Duty: Vanguard. In addition to new guns and a special timed event featuring Godzilla and King Kong (because of course), this season also sees the debut of some new types of private matches - although Raven have qualified that the latter are temporarily disabled due to “stability issues”. At least that gives us time to download the 39GB update for Warzone, but remember to leave 13GB extra room for the patch to copy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Stanley Parable is a game about a man who leaves his desk one day to discover that all of his most difficult to animate colleagues have vanished. First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.


But most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.

Or forking out literally twice as much for Sonic Origins, I suppose.

I've given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.
As I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.

Published by Raw Fury, American Arcadia centres on Trevor Hills – an average bloke in flares, tank top and ‘tache – who is a bit too boring to survive the unwitting reality-show metropolis of Arcadia where he lives. Cue a mysterious guide who may or may not be trying to help Trev escape. It's good to hear that Yuri Lowenthal and Cissy Jones are back on voice duties, presumably as Trevor and his new pal, after their top-notch performances in Call Of The Sea.

It's a game about bending and distorting shapes by applying mathematical transformations, starting with a simple flat sheet and aiming to replicate elaborate 3D shapes which look like blown glass sculptures. It's done cleverly and simply by dragging shapes through zones which distort them in real time but alas, I myself am simple too. Some of the shapes I've accidentally made in Tandis are downright reality-breaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, we were amazed to find EVGA's RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra graphics card going for $999 at Newegg - a $300 reduction from the card's MSRP and a big statement about the burgeoning health of the GPU market. Today, the beefy GPU has appeared for just $889 at Newegg, a healthy $110 reduction. That's a great price for the best high-end graphics card right now, especially for one that's made by the trusted folks at EVGA.

A new video which describes the contents of the next release - Update 6, focused on exploration - also explains why the development team are going to start taking longer between releases. The short answer? Because they're working on releasing version 1.0.

GameStop are selling the massive 2TB variant of the drive for just $155.99, some $15 less than the cheapest comparable drive anywhere else and way below the $174 that Amazon are charging. That's a great deal for a drive that we wholeheartedly recommend - especially when it's down to crazy-low prices like this.

Sure enough, it wasn't Diablo 4 , but a mobile game called Diablo Immortal. Blizzard's warnings didn't stop the developers from being booed on stage at Blizzcon, which seemed harsh.

Now that Diablo 4 has been announced (in 2019) and we've seen all the ways it's catering to fans of classic Diablo 2, perhaps the world is ready for Immortals. If that's so, then good news: it's now also coming to PC, with a free-to-play open beta on June 2nd.

It adds far bigger maps than Galactic Civilizations 3, along with the opportunity to bring more worlds into your dastardly empire or benevolent federation than before. All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher's Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warstride Challenges is an early access FPS that takes the retro shoot 'em up and straps it in a rally car. Each level is a course with straights and corners and demons. You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you've turned every demon along the way into a red paste.
The game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It's quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that's worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it's a payoff you'll remember.

Think of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.

This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.


Without the update, it’s possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn’t at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It’s definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 3070 Ti is a great mid-range to high-end GPU, with excellent performance in rasterised games plus DLSS and RT support, but it's been hard to find at a good price if you haven't lucked out with a Founders Edition restock. Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within £100 of the £549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost £1000 or more at the beginning of the year. 
The cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we've found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking £649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who doesn’t want to go to wizard school? In fairness a few people, probably, and they'd best steer clear of Sega and Two Point Studios’ Two Point Campus when it launches later this year, because there’s going to be a canny few wizards kicking about being all magical. Two Point Studios have shown off a new trailer for one of the courses to expect when you arrive on campus, which has a lot of the potion brewing and casting of spells that you’d expect from even a magical academic establishment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not to damn with faint praise, but the Lenovo Legion 5 is kinda okay. A bit alright. Reasonably reasonable. It’s a gaming laptop with specs, price and performance that are so straight down the middle of the road that they might as well be studded with cat’s eyes. Apologies in advance if this is not the most action-packed hardware review you’ve ever read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.
The game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.

The roadmap sets out new maps, modes and two batches of story events for Season 2. So far, so good. Yet it also hints vaguely at what’s coming in Season 3 – now starting all the way off on November 8th, with the open beta for Forge from September. 343 cite “quality of life” lessons from Season 1, along with the sensible goal of maintaining team health, for the extension.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right, housekeeping first. Dune: Spice Wars’ Steam page describes it as a  “real-time strategy game with 4X elements”. An odd choice, considering Shiro Games themselves downplay RTS elements in a Steam blog. Spice Wars is as much 4X as the dead eyes of two smiley faces, and one with enough forward momentum as to make such tantalising lies unnecessary. Embrace your grand strategy! It’s like John Dune always said: “Fear is the path to the dark side, Malcolm Reynolds”.

It is TikTok's text-to-speech voice, and it is everywhere. Now it's even in Half-Life, thanks to a mod which replaces the opening tram ride voiceover with a TikTok TTS version. It's a distressing artifact, and I hate that it kinda works. See/hear for yourself in the video below.

Not only did they construct an entire walled city to hark back to its iconic, titular location, but they also had an enormous Nautiloid crashed into the top of it. There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more.

We also caught up with Larian to chat about Baldur's Gate 3 (watch out for a dedicated video coming in the next day or two), and we capped off the day by attending Shirley "Skyrim Grandma" Curry's panel over on the Bumblebee Theatre stage. I'll be writing up a separate post about this in the coming days, but needless to say, Shirley was an absolute delight.
