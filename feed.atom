        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been nearly one decade since Intel began working on 5-level paging support for the Linux kernel to allow for greater virtual and physical address space with expanding memory sizes. The 5-level paging kernel-side bits were upstreamed back in Linux 4.12 in 2017 and enabled by default since 2019 with Linux 5.5. Intel CPUs for a while (since Ice Lake) have supported 5-level paging and AMD CPUs too since Zen 4. The Linux kernel may move to unconditionally enabling 5-level paging support for x86_64 kernel builds...]]></summary>

Those who have played titles like Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail will be well aware of the performance potential of miHoYo when it comes to delivering hits. However, Zenless Zone Zero is different from these titles in terms of the core theme and gameplay aspects. For example, the new project has multiplayer elements, albeit in a limited fashion. Many have been wondering about whether the title has critical features like cross-play and cross-platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Astrolabe Games and Frozen Lake Games have announced that retro-styled Old School Rally is releasing into Early Access on July 19, 2024.


If you asked me to tell you where Old School Rally draws its styling from, I’m not sure I could tell you beyond “the ‘90s.” It reminds me of Top Gear Rally, but that had circuitous tracks rather than linear ones. It doesn’t really look much like Sega Rally Championship, which is generally what I think of when it comes to old school rally games.




Instead, Old School Rally seems to be “old school” mostly in aesthetic, which it does rather convincingly. That’s what really drew me to it; I’m a sucker for the chunky polygons and unfiltered textures of the PS1 look. Beyond that, it looks like a capable racing title.


The Early Access release already has a lot of features under its belt, including time trial ghosts and racing wheel support. Frozen Lake has also made some tweaks and improvements based on feedback they gained from a recent demo.


The developer is aiming to have the Early Access period last less than a year. At launch, they say it’s a “robust experience with numerous cars and tracks to enjoy and various modes including Rally mode and Time Trial mode.” They’ll be adding more cars and tracks over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a beginner in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, the Lieke Martens Flashback SBC might be up your alley. 


While this SBC might not be very interesting for an experienced player, it's cheap and easy to complete. By completing the special challenge, you can get an exciting attacking item with three playstyle+. To get the card, you'll need to complete all the tasks before the SBC expires. 


EA FC 24 Lieke Martens Flashback SBC tasks


The Lieke Martens Flashback SBC has only one task, and the conditions are pretty simple as well. This makes her a perfect card to obtain for those who might not have too much fodder in their clubs. 


Task 1 - Lieke Martens



Min. 1 Players from: Netherlands


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 87



If you have a duplicate TOTS card, it could be used while completing this challenge. Otherwise, I will just use a TOTW item, and the 83+ TOTW Player Pick SBC can be your best friend if you require a Team of the Week item. 


EA FC 24 Lieke Martens Flashback SBC cheapest solutions


The EA FC 24 Lieke Martens Flashback SBC is one of the cheapest challenges you can currently complete in Ultimate Team. However, there are plenty of other interesting SBCs that can be costly to complete. Hence, only use the fodder required to save the rest for other challenges. 


Task 1 - Lieke Martens



Fabinho 84


Wendie Renard 88


Bernardo Silva 88


Koen Casteels 84


Bruno Fernandes 88


Christina Endler 88


Cucho Hernandez TOTS 88


Stanislav Lobotka 84


Lena Oberdorf 87


Martin Odegaard 87


Cody Gakpo 83



The 95-rated LW item offers 5* Skills and 5* Weak Foot. You also get three great playstyle+, including Technical+ and Whipped+. While the card won't compete with the top-tier items of the meta, it's no pushover either. Mertens' Flashback version has 94 Pace, 97 Dribbling, 96 Passing, and 95 Shooting, all of which combine pretty well with her work rate and 5* Weak Foot.

Specifically, the developer stated, "Currently the issue is not widespread." This is the reason it hasn't yet pulled the killswitch on The Trickster and removed the Killer from the game. However, fans are now pleading that the character be temporarily removed from the game, or a warning added in its opening menus to ensure those who could be affected by the graphical issue are aware.

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

There are two important reasons for this: first, generative AI can have issues with IP rights, and second, Nintendo makes games with more than just technology. 


The Q&A session, which was translated by Tweaktown, shows how Nintendo sees generative AI and how it's being used in the games industry. While other businesses believe there are more pros to using the technology to streamline game development, Furukawa beautifully explained how Nintendo has been making games for many years using creative processes and technology in harmony and won't be relying on generative AI to speed part of that process up.

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has surprise-dropped Mega Cat Studios' Food Fight: Culinary Combat on Steam today. Previously, the title was only available on Atari’s own VCS console.


Food Fight: Culinary Combat is an arena shooter take on the classic Food Fight arcade game. There’s local and online multiplayer, four modes, six maps, and even split-screen.




Strangely, a lot of the marketing information focuses on what goes around the multiplayer itself. There’s an Atariverse hub where you can talk to characters from other games and the creators of the original Food Fight. You can also find circuit boards to unlock Atari arcade games, and more cosmetic items for character customization. Which sounds rad, but I still don’t know much about how the game actually plays. 


The four game modes are Buffet Brawl, King of the Cone, Cookie Collector, and Crumbling, which aren’t very descriptive names. The Steam listing has a tag for PvE, which is suggested in the trailer but not in the store blurb.


Atari fans seem to look favorably on the VCS version. The most significant complaint I could find was that, because the VCS is a US-only console and it has a small userbase, it was sometimes difficult to find people to play with. Hopefully, with the Steam release, things will be more lively.


Food Fight: Culinary Combat is now available for the Atari VCS and PC. Console versions are planned.

If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.

The first hour or so of Zenless Zone Zero is essentially one long tutorial that will introduce you to important aspects of the game, as well as your starter characters. As you get through it, you will unlock the Events tab, which will be accessible via the main menu.

When you get in there, you will see a long list of currently active or future events, and the third one down will be called New City Visitor's Passport. This is the daily log-in event, and you can click here to claim each daily reward. You can only claim them one at a time, so come back each day for more goodies.


What are the daily check-in rewards?


In total, you can get 10 Encrypted Master Tapes from this event that you can then use to pull on the special character banner for Ellen Joe, or hold them for a future character if you wish.



Day 1 - 1 Encrypted Master Tape


Day 2 - 1 Encrypted Master Tape


Day 3 - 2 Encrypted Master Tapes


Day 4 - 1 Encrypted Master Tape

According to Sakaguchi, he loaded up Final Fantasy XIV in 2021 with the intention of spending just a few hours with the game before attending an event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has added seven new games to their NES channel on their Nintendo Switch Online subscription. While some of these are expected first-party games, there are a few in the mix that are rather surprising.


Here’s the full list:



Urban Champion


Golf


Donkey Kong Jr. Math


Mach Rider


The Mystery of Atlantis


SOLAR JETMAN


COBRA TRIANGLE





The one that stands out is Mystery of Atlantis, which was never released in North America. Mystery of Atlantis isn’t even the name on its birth certificate; it's Atlantis no Nazo (which really does translate to Mystery of Atlantis), a questionably challenging game from Sunsoft. It features 100 levels, but they’re not sequential. Figuring out how they connect, discovering bizarre secrets to find new exits, and eventually reaching the end is where most of the fun lies. And when I say bizarre secrets, there are instances where you have to jump into what is normally a bottomless pit and another where you have to blow yourself up in a specific spot. It’s not for everyone.


On top of that, we also have the also-questionable Urban Champion, an early fighting game. There’s Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you need to brush up on your arithmetic. Mach Rider and Golf round out the first-party offerings. Then there is also Solar Jetman and Cobra Triangle from Rare’s early days.


It's not exactly the most top-shelf selection of games from the console, but most of them are worth trying out. Maybe not Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you’re out of your grade school years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail had a fairly smooth start at launch as thousands of players jumped in to play it during an early access period before the floodgates opened and everyone else poured in to marvel at what the expansion has to offer. However, there's one feature that keeps cropping up in a less-than-favorable way. 


Of course, I'm talking about dye channels. The expansion brought two dye channels to the game, allowing players to create custom armors and set themselves apart from the crowd. Prior to Dawntrail, dye channels changed the entirety of a pre-defined part or material of a character's clothing/armor. Now, it's possible to use two dye channels to change all of it.

The portability of Nintendo Switch makes it a great system to play a wide variety of genres, and while visual novels can be enjoyed perfectly well on your TV, there's something about playing them on a handheld which just feels 'right'. Since launch, the console has accrued some great examples of the genre, and the catalogue of great visual novels on Switch is growing all the time. Everyone loves a good book, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy Kid is one of the starter characters in Zenless Zone Zero. A member of the Cunning Rabits, he takes jobs that send him into the Hollows to do all kinds of things, from saving people to bringing back lost items. He is also quickly becoming a fan favorite, but there is one question people seem to have about him, and that is whether he is even human.


Is Billy Kid a robot in Zenless Zone Zero?


Billy Kid is a cyborg, not a robot, and there is an important distinction. A robot is an artificial human being, usually housing some form of AI, and cannot be considered human in origin. A cyborg, on the other hand, is a human being that has undergone surgical procedures to have various parts of them replaced with artificial parts, as well as potentially undergoing other biochemical or electronic modifications. 


Based on his character design, it looks as though much of Billy's body has been replaced by metal parts. We can clearly see that both hands are mechanical, and his entire upper body appears to be as well. It's hard to know if his head has been replaced or if he is just wearing a mask, but we can tell that the excellent hair is certainly still real. 


We know that Billy is a huge fan of a fictional show called the Starlight Knights, so it seems likely that his modifications were done to bring him closer to the level of his fictional heroes. Hopefully, as time goes on, we will learn more about Billy and what caused him to want to change his body, or forced him to.

How Daze works in Zenless Zone Zero


You build up Daze on enemies by attacking them, and when their Daze bar is full, they will be stunned. You can see the enemy's Daze bar just below their health bar. Once they are stunned, the bar will start to empty, and when it is fully empty, they will once again be able to attack you.

Last year in May, Nintendo's Japanese support service revealed it would be ending repairs for the Wii U when its current parts inventory ran out. Now, in an update just over a year later on its website, it's announced the service for this system (originally released in 2012) has officially ended.
Here's a rough translation, explaining how it's run out of the replacement parts necessary to repair consoles - with the company now no longer accepting repairs this week as of 3rd July 2024. This includes Wii U peripherals. You can see on Nintendo's official website the many other systems it's no longer accepting repairs for, which covers its past-generation products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Zenless Zone Zero launched globally, you could pre-register for the game, participate in closed beta tests, and wait in anticipation of its arrival. By doing this, you contribute to the game's pre-registration milestones and, over time, help unlock various rewards. Following Zenless Zone Zero's release, you can claim these pre-registration rewards shortly after starting your playthrough.


How to obtain pre-registration rewards in Zenless Zone Zero


Claiming pre-registration rewards in Zenless Zone Zero requires completing the game's first few tutorial areas and loading in as your starting playable character. After defeating the tutorial's boss and spawning in as your default character, open your game menu, select More at the bottom of the screen, and open your mail to view the global pre-registration milestone reward notification.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Finishing the tutorial doesn't take long, as it mainly includes some cutscenes and battles. Depending on whether you skip the cutscenes and read the story's dialogue, you can expect to get through the tutorial in about 10-30 minutes.


Within the global pre-registration reward message, you'll find a message of gratitude from miHoYo alongside a list of items. Below is every reward you'll obtain:



Master Tape (20)


Boopon (5)


Corin (1)


Denny (30,000)



In short, as a thank you for pre-registering for Zenless Zone Zero, you'll get various rewards, including Corin Wickes as a free playable agent and some money. At the very least, they'll help you get a few steps forward early on, which can help you snowball your progress. Although the message doesn't mention an expiration date, it's safe to redeem your reward sooner rather than later, just in case.

The only problem is that the way you redeem these codes isn't exactly clear or spelled out to you. 


Regardless of whether you're playing Zenless Zone Zero at launch or months later, the game has dozens of codes you can take advantage of that give you precious resources in-game to use and will generally give you a leg up when it comes to progressing the story. They're hugely helpful right at the start to push back the point where you need to start grinding for characters and experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the Blizzard China team, NetEase commemorated the new deal between the two companies by unveiling a 15 meter long (~49 feet) Lightforged Gorehowl sculpture at the Lujiazui Waterfront Park in Shanghai. The hulking statue will be on display from 10AM - 10 PM local time from July 4 through July 7 for fans looking to visit.


Image by WoW on Weibo


In Warcraft lore, Gorehowl is a legendary two-handed axe wielded by the orcish Hellscream family. In the games, Gorehowl was originally wielded by Grommash Hellscream before being passed on to his son, Garrosh, who wielded it through the Mists of Pandaria expansion before discarding it for an Old God replica of the weapon called Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl. Players can acquire their own version of Gorehowl from the final boss of Karazhan, Prince Malchezaar, though canonically it's not actually the Gorehowl weapon.


The statue is celebrating the return of World of Warcraft to China which is scheduled co commence this summer. The popular MMORPG was taken offline in China last year after Blizzard and NetEase failed to reach a new agreement. NetEase had originally built a replica of the Gorehowl weapon back during the Warlords of Draenor expansion release in 2014, but dismantled it after the two failed to come to an agreement. The new "Lightforged" variant of Gorehowl that is now on display represents a resurrection of sorts, which is fitting for the new agreement.


The first 5,000 visitors to the site each day can complete a "photo-taking quest" to earn a commemorative inflatable Gorehowl to help them remember the event.


The next World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within, is set to release next month on August 26. The MMORPG will become available again in China on August 1, just in time for players to reacquaint themselves ahead of the expansion launch.

        <updated>2024-07-03T18:28:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.
For more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We were working on getting the rights to this game for several years".
2002's The Thing is widely regarded as one of the best horror games based on an existing media franchise. Many licensed horror games are sadly relegated to genres that require a specific setup, such as asymmetrical multiplayer or short VR experiences, but The Thing — a third-person squad-based shooter — dared to go one step further, telling its own unique story that serves as a proper sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie masterpiece.
It's not a game that frequents mainstream remaster wishlists, but Nightdive Studios is nevertheless delivering what few of us realised we wanted with The Thing: Remastered. Announced during IGN Live and scheduled to land on the Switch later this year, Computer Artworks' original is getting the full revamp treatment, with updated visuals, improved lighting, numerous quality-of-life tweaks, and more.

There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

This one will see you taking instructions from passionate co-pilots (including one that sounds jarringly like Arnold Schwarzenegger) as you speed through over 400km of rally circuits from lush German forests to frosty Finnish mountain peaks.

In The Legend of Zelda franchise, finding and carrying the legendary Master Sword is perhaps one of the most important tasks you'll need to accomplish to defeat evil and save the land of Hyrule. For one individual, however, carrying a replica Master Sword around in real life has led to a rather unfortunate jail sentence.
As covered by Eurogamer, a man named Anthony Bray from Nuneaton, England, was caught with a six-inch replica of the Master Sword while wandering about in public. According to Bray, it was intended to be used as a fidget toy, however, arresting officers stated that it "was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them".

Tchia is incredible. If that's all you need to know, then good — this game is best played, in our opinion, completely blind. That's how we went into it, and it was all the better for it. Every strange, unexpected twist was a delight, and we never knew where the game would take us next. So, please, if you trust our opinions, trust this one: Tchia is incredible.
Here's what we knew about Tchia before we went into it: it had been touted as one of those nebulously-defined "cosy games", and it involved sailing. That much you could divine from its key art alone, with a girl on a raft sailing through crisp, blue waters towards sparkling white sands. It was only an hour or two into the game before we started to understand that Tchia is much, much more than that. Almost a ludicrous amount of more-ness, really, especially considering that the team that created this wonderful game is just 12 people.

It also doesn’t work right now. But for one brief, debatably glorious day on June 29th, it did. And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom spat a little squirt of news bile on us yesterday, like a hideous zombie vomiting up demos and release dates. One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

That's because he played Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess, the upcoming action strategy game about defending a maiden from colourful monsters and recruiting villagers to cleanse demonic defilement. Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become availabl…]]></summary>

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed.

Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good.

There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."


Here are the game's minimum and recommended PC specs:
Minimum
Operating System: Windows 10
Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 3 3300X
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Graphics Card: GTX 1060 / Radeon RX 580 (6GB+ RAM)

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me continue the theme from our round-up of Steam sale reccs for under a tenner, while exchanging the concept of money for the concept of time: what can you do in celebrated open world "anecdote generator" Dragon's Dogma 2 in two hours or less? Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it's 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. 
But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart …]]></summary>

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mentioned it briefly in my Shadow Of The Erdtree review, but there's one area of the DLC where your steed Torrent is so scared they refuse to be summoned. That's because said area is a woodland that's been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don't dare clop their hooves. What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development on slip-slidey FPS Tribes 3: Rivals is set to slow, just months after its early access launch, as developers Prophecy Games say it’s not proving successful enough to "support the studio."
In a post ominously titled "Tribes 3 Player Update", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" Ultra Strikers. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Rising is a proper gem, taking an overdone trope - zombies in a shopping centre - and turning it into a brilliantly quirky and challenging survival game that fully delivers on the madcap joy of using anything you can find to mow down hordes of the undead and then snap photos of them. Truly a proto-Instagram-era Nostradamus. Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover.

If you liked Townscaper for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of Tiny Glade's homely castle creation, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. Dystopika is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.

Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

Decisions, decisions...

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent.

        <updated>2024-06-26T11:54:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 4 is my favourite racing game of all time, and a gloriously daft celebration of going fast set in a stunning, pastoral recreation of the UK. If you haven't played it, you should buy it quick - because it's being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don't worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major recording labels, including UMG and Sony have filed a pair of broadly similar copyright complaints against two key generative AI music services. The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels' music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they're already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were 'evasive' on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software games have garnered a reputation – alongside the rest of the Soulslike subgenre – for delivering difficult, punishing experiences that reward persistence with an unparalleled thrill of victory. The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: Diablo 4, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.

So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game Rocket League.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

I was tempted to recreate a hellish mockery of his fun hidden face game by trapping a crumbling mirror image of his visage, Dorian Gray style, somewhere in the above image. Alas, my version of Photoshop appears to be lacking that function. I suppose I will have to turn to other avenues of entertainment, such as a video game, should any exist.
So I just checked there's actually loads of them. What a turn out! Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Sega announced Fearless: The Year of Shadow, a yearlong celebration of one of Sonic's biggest rivals, adversaries, and frenemies, Shadow the Hedgehog. In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Sonic Generations in 2011 gave players a series-wide greatest hits remake package to celebrate 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog. Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic's abilities, but we've seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20240615/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
