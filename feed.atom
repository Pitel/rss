Season 3 Reloaded starts on May 1. Raven Software provided a sneak peek at what's in store for the upcoming update. Notably, there wasn't any mention of changes to Urzikstan or the traditional battle royale game mode mentioned in the blog post. After two straight seasonal updates focused on adding two new Resurgence maps, players assumed that Urzikstan would finally get some much-needed shine in Season 3 Reloaded. 


It appears that they were sorely mistaken, as CharlieIntel reports, "There are no updates or changes to Urzikstan in Warzone with Season 3 Reloaded. The blog just says the story within th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NBA superstar Devin Booker is set to receive an operator skin in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. Here is everything you need to know about adding the bundle to your collection. 


Activision confirmed Suns guard Devin Booker is getting an operator bundle in MW3 and Warzone. Booker joins his Phoenix teammate Kevin Durant, who received an operator bundle in 2023. In a recent appearance on the Aux Money Podcast, Durant revealed that Booker is "elite" at Warzone and averages 12 kills a game.

The Devin Booker operator bundle can only be obtained through the CoD store. Activision did not reveal a price point, but based on previous operator skins, it will most likely cost 2,400 CoD points, equivalent to $19.99.


When is Devin Booker coming to MW3 and Warzone ?


Activision announced that players can purchase the Devin Booker operator bundle starting May 1. Coincidentally, this aligns with the NBA Playoffs. Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns are currently down two games in the first-round series against Minnesota. It's quite possible that the Suns season will be over by the time fans get a chance to purchase this operator bundle, which would be unfortunate timing. However, a comeback is never out of the cards when you have fellow NBA superstar Kevin Durant on your side. 


Everything included in the Devin Booker operator bundle.


Here is everything that comes with the Booker operator bundle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raven Software planned on removing the High Trip Resurgence limited-time game mode from Warzone, but decided instead to give players a chance to keep it around for another week. Yet what many expected to be a slam-dunk vote has devolved into a more heated debate. 


The Warzone devs created a poll for players to decide whether or not they want the High Trip Resurgence LTM to return. As of writing, 50.7 percent of the 23,171 votes lean yes, while 49.3 percent said no. This is a surprise, after players initially pleaded for one of the game mode's features to be added permanently. High Trip Resurgence operates the same as a traditional Resurgence match for the most part, but players collect gummies that each have a power-up. Green Boost Grants players a temporary speed boost and negates fall damage, Fill Up awards faster reload speeds, High Focus highlights enemies with a red outline, and Loot Blast offers more loot from crates.

After getting a taste of unlimited-tac sprint from the green gummy, some players were ready for it to become a feature in every mode. However, other users weren't as fond of the mode and wanted it removed. CoD content creator TacticalBrit asked, "Are we genuinely going to keep an LTM that's just a reskin of the boy's LTM, and we've literally had no others?"


Meanwhile, Warzone content creator JGOD was shocked by how divided the poll was. "They don't seem to lean into LTMs, and the 1 time they do, half the people vote not to keep it," the YouTuber added. 


Warzone Meta asked,  "For the people who voted no, do you hate having fun?" If the devs don't plan on adding a playlist in its place, it's hard to tell why players would feel so negatively about High Trip Resurgence. But it's clear that players are frustrated and this poll paints a much more troubling picture about the overall community sentiment regarding the battle royale.

Oshi no Ko Chapter 148 will go live on May 8, 2024 at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET. That's two weeks out from its previous chapter, no. 147, so it'll be a little bit more of a wait for the next piece of the puzzle.



While we don't know how many chapters remain in Oshi no Ko, it does feel like we're speeding towards a conclusion of some kind. Now's a good time to get caught up, or maybe update your social media filters to avoid any possible spoilers…]]></summary>

Helldivers 2 players have been struggling against the current Major Order since last week. It tasks Helldivers with successfully defending a total of 10 planets, pushing back against the enemy faction's attacks. However, the constant onslaught and ever-encroaching presence of the Automatons are finally getting to everyone. With just over a day left, players are only halfway through the Major Order and showing signs of wanting to give up already.

While it may lack the damage required to be effective in Warzone, the quick time-to-kill in standard multiplayer makes it viable. It's the perfect weapon for players with a fast paced playstyle that get in close to the action. 


How to build a WSP Swarm loadout for accuracy

In Season 3 of Modern Warfare 3, there are a few viable ways to build the WSP Swarm. Using the SMG means you're getting in close, using it nearly point blank, and want to have high mobility. This specific build is meant for that, while also allowing some mid-range firing to be accurate. We wouldn't recommend using it as a first priority when engaging enemies from far away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slice 'n' dice the frame rate.
Many games can get away with slightly sketchy performance if the gameplay experience is a bit more laidback and relaxed (or ‘cinematic’, if you like). Others, however, like Slave Zero X, which focus on blistering combat and stylish visuals, can be almost impossible to recommend if their performance isn’t up to scratch. Sadly, this is exactly the case with publisher Ziggurat Interactive’s retro action game, which honestly has the potential to be one of the most respectable hack 'n' slash/beat ‘em ups in recent memory, but for now, squanders this on Switch with a dreadful frame rate.
This is genuinely frustrating because the core gameplay is exceptional - truly. And for a short period as we worked our way through the game’s opening level, we thought to ourselves, “Good lord, this is great!” Unfortunately, while the introductory level boasts reasonably stable performance to complement the non-stop action, the frame rate tanks after you beat the first boss and move onto the second stage. It got so bad that we had to swallow our pride and eventually call it quits before the end, defeated by the poor optimisation on Nintendo’s console. The publisher says there's a patch on the way which should alleviate this, but the game came out nearly two weeks ago at the time of writing, and the damage is done.

If you played the previous season, the weekly Shaping the Dreamsurge quest has returned. But what is the reward, specifically the Dreamsurge Cradle item actually used for in WoW Dragonflight Season 4?


Screenshot by Destructoid


What is the Dreamsurge Cradle?


The Dreamsurge Cradle is a currency item that when working properly, allows you to trade them for appropriate Item Level gear for that season. Basically, you do the Shaping the Dreamsurge weekly quest to obtain a Dreamsurge Cradle, and then visit Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem—the NPC who gave you the quest—and turn in your Dreamsurge Cradle in exchange for an item of your choosing.


However, as of the start of Season 4. Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem appears to be bugged. While he should be selling a variety of gear to you in exchange for your Dreamsurge Cradle, he currently does not sell any items at all. Unfortunately, a few other vendor NPC's appear to be bugged at the start of Season 4 as well, not allowing you to exchange your currency with them.


Blizzard has confirmed they are aware of the issue, so hopefully it will be hotfixed soon, as the Dreamsurge Cradle item is extremely useful for getting started in a new season. It essentially allows you to quickly gear up an alt and start farming Mythic + dungeons and other forms of end-game content.


Even though it's currently bugged, you can still complete the Shaping the Dreamsurge quest and go ahead and collect your weekly Dreamsurge Cradle as well as the Cache of Dreams that may have some loot in it. You can still start collecting your Dreamsurge Cradles so once the bug is fixed you are able to exchange what you have earned for powerful gear.

Although the tactical AR is available around the map like any other weapon, finding one can be tricky if you're unlucky.


Where to find a Tactical Assault Rifle (AR) in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 2


You can find tactical assault rifles as floor and chest loot anywhere on the Fortnite map. While your best bet is to visit named locations, weapon cases or bunkers, you can also find this weapon on the floor randomly or at a smaller, unmarked point of interest.

        <updated>2024-04-24T17:59:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Dragonflight's fourth season launched yesterday, and rather than a juicy content patch in the form of a "10.3," we were instead treated to some fundamental changes to PvE content and a redux of Dragonflight's existing dungeons and raids. 


The Revival Catalyst - a system in which players can turn non-raid gear into tier pieces, got a slight reworking as well. This season, the tier sets' appearance and bonuses, taken from the pool of previously available options, were voted on by the community.


Revival Catalyst charges have been reset to 0. If, for whatever reason, you were hanging on to charges from last season, those are (understandably) gone. On the flipside, charges are granted every week, rather than the previous biweekly cadence of seasons past. The location of the Catalyst, just East of Valdrakken, can be seen on the map below.


Screenshot by Destructoid.


To make the most of your Revival Catalyst charges, it's recommended that you save them for gear that has a higher upgrade potential using Flightstones and Crests. To check how far a piece of gear can be upgraded, you need only look at the tooltip under its name: Explorer is the lowest upgrade level, and Myth is the highest. To maximize your tier set's potential (and longevity), I'd recommend using charges only on Champion gear and higher. 



Explorer - 454 to 476


Adventurer - 467 to 483


Veteran - 480 to 502


Champion - 493 to 515


Hero - 506 to 522


Myth - 519 to 528



The Flightstones and Crests you'll need to upgrade your gear can be found organically by completing content or doing quests. Flightstones pop up everywhere, but you'll have to take on challenging content befitting your gear's level to earn the appropriate Crests to upgrade it. These Catalyst changes should allow for a bit more flexibility if you do happen to find a piece of gear on a higher "track" later on, so don't be afraid to use them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Season 3 of Call of Duty: Warzone, not much has changed. Every once in a while we get a new, completely overpowered weapon to use for a week or two before it gets nerfed to infinity. Hopefully, that's coming soon. In the meantime, you might as well take advantage of the KV Broadside conversion kit while you can, your enemies aren't going to have a problem killing you with it. 


What is the KV Broadside conversion kit?


If you aren't familiar, the KV Broadside is a shotgun in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. It's not that special to be honest, just a regular shotgun that's good up close and not-so-good from further away, as you'd expect. However, there's a new conversion kit that turns the shotgun into a battle rifle, making it fully automatic and giving it much better range.

The Brotherhood is a paramilitary order dedicated to preserving and regulating advanced technology, and it appears in every Fallout game, plus the TV show.  It has its own hierarchy and ranks, which we have compiled a simplified breakdown of.


Ever since the Brotherhood of Steel was formed in the wake of the bombs dropping, the order has become rather fragmented, meaning some divisions don't all share the exact same hierarchy. They're all typically derived from the original regime established by the Brotherhood of Steel's founders, though, with the various ranks ordered similarly. However, the roles of certain ranks have also changed through Fallout's history.

This has the unfortunate side effect of a segment of players not getting their hands on some fun and unique weapons. Recently, Bungie has begun offering alternative activities to give those players a taste of the good life. With Into the Light, everyone can get their hands on the Root of Nightmares (former) exclusive grenade launcher, Forbearance. Here are the God Rolls that make a good thing even better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 is often considered one of the best horror games of all time, sometimes even stretching its praise to one of the best games ever made. Remaking it is a tall order, but Konami and Bloober Team are giving it the old College try. So here’s what we know about the upcoming remake.


What is the release date for the Silent Hill 2 remake?


There is no solid date set for the release of the remake of Silent Hill 2. It was announced back in October of 2022, and currently has a release window set for 2024.


Neither Konami nor Bloober Team have been more specific than that, and chances are we won’t really get a solid release date until the game is almost ready to ship. Konami itself has been rather restrictive on what information about the game it puts out.

According to Insider Gaming, which has allegedly seen early footage of Assassin's Creed Hexe in action, the game is aiming to launch in 2026, and is described as being a more linear experience when compared to the modern entries. Ever since Assassin's Creed Origins, the games became large-scale, open world action RPGs, though the most recent game—Assassin's Creed Mirage—de-emphasized the RPG elements for a smaller adventure that aimed to return to the series roots.

That’s the suggestion from the head of Ori and the Blind Forest developers Moon Studios in the wake of launching their own early access Soulslike, No Rest For The Wicked.

This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.

Another Crab's Treasure, as the name suggests, is a humorous and pun-filled world where the sea is your Soulslike oyster. A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector. What follows is an adventure that excels at being an amusing and bright reprieve from the otherwise dark an…]]></summary>

They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The HRM-9 has been the dominant SMG in Warzone Season 2, but FaZe Swagg thinks the new meta VEL 46 class setup could unseat it as the battle royale's best close-quarters gun. 


Good aim, smart positioning, and a healthy dose of luck are all crucial to getting wins in Warzone, but if you're not using the best guns, you're always going to find yourself at a disadvantage. That's why people are always trying out new loadouts and attachments, hoping to find the game's next meta. 


The HRM-9 is Warzone's current SMG king, but according to FaZe Swagg, the VEL 46, better known as the MP7, may just be the gun to usurp it.




"I hadn't used that gun in a minute," the FaZe streamer explained. "When I tell you I was gunning every single person with the HRM-9—I couldn't believe how good this thing was. Everyone was spamming 'What's this MP7 class?'"


If you want to try it out for yourself, then you can check out the loadout below. 



Muzzle: ZEHMN35 Compensator


Underbarrel: DR-6 Handstop


Laser: EXF Solarflare


Stock: DEMO RXT Stock


Magazine: 50 Round Mag



After seeing this video, I went into Warzone and tried it out for myself, and I have to say, it felt really nice. I found it pretty easy to control, and felt that it was powerful enough to stand up to the HRM-9. 


I don't know for sure if it'll unseat the HRM-9 as Warzone's best SMG, but I think it's definitely viable, and players better than me might get even more performance out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The life of a Soul Reaper, Quincy, and Hollow can be pretty tough. Fortunately, various helpful items can make the experience much more accessible. Here's how to get the Red Elixir in Type Soul. 


Where to find Red Elixir in Type Soul


Type Souls's Red Elixir functions similarly to the Red Pill, enhancing your abilities with five Skill Points. To obtain this exclusive asset, you'll need to exchange 8,000 Kan with a merchant in Karakura Town. However, the shop owner only grants access to winners of the intense Karakura Raid. These raids commence every hour, but you'll need a substantial number of players in the vicinity to meet the match quota. 


After a successful round, the real challenge begins when locating the merchant. Type Soul doesn't provide a standard game map, so we'll show you a few key landmarks to help you narrow down the shop owner's location. 


Type Soul Karakura Town merchant location


To find the Karakura Town merchant in Type Soul, follow these steps:



Use the Senkaimon ability, which will be rewarded to players automatically upon spawn.


Travel through the doorway and make your way to the large white bridge.


Look to the right of the bridge (it could be different depending on the spawn) and head toward the roadway near the oceanside.



The merchant will be located in the brick houses:

You should spot the shop owner on the upper floor as you travel down the pathway:

Talk to the shop owner to get the Red Elixir in Type Soul. If you don't mind using in-game currency, you can also use Robux. For the free route, earn Kan from missions and defeat various enemies. 


With the Red Elixir on hand, open your inventory and use it for the Skill Points. You may want to save it for the more advanced levels, as it can be difficult to rise up in the ranks during these stages.

Manor Lords Early Access release date and countdown


Manor Lord‘s Early Access release is on Friday, April 26, 2024.


That's what is slated both on Steam and in the press materials I have. They haven't stated an exact time. However, Steam gives an estimate which puts it at 10 am EST. Without a statement from the developer or publisher, that is not necessarily a time they have to adhere to, but it is the most solid schedule we have. So, with that in mind, we've set the countdown to then.

For their spring releases each year, it typically means shipping with a GCC compiler that isn't even officially released as stable yet. With this week's release of Fedora 40, it's shipping with GCC 14.0.1 as the development version that will culminate with the inaugural GCC 14 stable release in the coming weeks. Plus Fedora 40 has all of the other latest GNU toolchain components and then over on the LLVM side is with the current LLVM 18 stable series.

You’re probably aware of Square Enix’s lengthy and somewhat lavish efforts to remake the 1997 game Final Fantasy VII. The second instalment of this ambitious remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, was released just recently, and we’re still likely to be years away from any sort of conclusion. But you might not be aware of an earlier attempt to remake Final Fantasy VII – or more specifically, to demake it.
In 2005, a company called Shenzhen Nanjing Technology released a 2D version of Final Fantasy VII for the Subor line of bootleg Famicom consoles (AKA Famiclones). Although necessarily cut down to fit within the capabilities of 8-bit technology, this demake nevertheless managed to pack in most of the plot points from the 32-bit PlayStation game, and it was just one of many ambitious demakes from the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land is like a sanitised manga-ish Mad Max Fury Road, where there are fewer explosions and nobody huffs paint and screams "Witness me!". So, arguably, a less cool Mad Max. In this incarnation it's an open world action game with light RPG elements; in previous incarnations it is a manga and anime by the creator of Dragon Ball. My takeaway from playing Sand Land the game is that it is a tremendous advert for the manga and anime, in the sense that everything good about Sand Land the game is from those, and I would rather be reading or watching them instead.

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story. Other elements of the game, like its …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely "Republicans buy sneakers too", if you ask me.
It made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.

It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it's been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…]]></summary>

The SaGa titles are part of a series that started life as Final Fantasy Legend, named to capitalise on Square’s blossoming juggernaut. Despite being separate creative endeavours, the two franchises have grown up together. While never achieving the superstar status of its sibling, SaGa has carved its own niche over the years. The franchise has healthy representation on Nintendo Switch, with the original Game Boy releases sitting alongside 2019's Scarlet Grace: Ambitions.
Mechanically similar to Scarlet Grace, Emerald Beyond is a comfortable experience for series veterans. It also sees series creator Akitoshi Kawazu return to writing and directing duties, which should delight fans.

This includes the emote reported as the most-used in Fortnite's seven-year history. That's either a worrying indictment of the game's players, or a (more?) worrying indictment of universal human psychology. What is the offending animation? Well, turns out people don't like being laughed at.

Grounded was never the most obvious candidate to go multi-platform from its Xbox home, but we were pleased to see it featured in the February Partner Direct, all the same. Right from this initial announcement, we had some trepidations about how this big world would hold up on Switch — fears that were proven legitimate when the game was released last week.
In our 6/10 review, we found that Grounded served up a lot of fun but the Switch port was let down by performance issues and necessary graphical downgrades. And it appears that we were not alone in our gameplay problems as Digital Foundry has today published a technical rundown of Grounded on Switch, and it ain't pretty.

EGX, of course, will feature a bunch of classic and upcoming games, while Comic Con is laser-targeted at our respected allies in the world of on-paper image-based storytelling with speech bubbles. EGX's headline partner is TikTok this year, which makes this a perfect nexus of entertainment artforms. All we need is a puppetshow now and possibly a semaphore stand, and the ritual will be complete.

Developer Daniel Burke furnished me with a little playable slice, and boy, Innkeep is a grim old time. I mean that as a compliment.
In it you run a big pub with room for a lot of grizzled adventurers, in a dog-eat-dog dark fantasy RPG sort of a world - think a roadside pub in one of the early seasons of Game Of Thrones, before everyone hated it. You do a lot of plate-spinning drudgery like cooking, cleaning, and serving, but also eavesdropping, rumourmongering, and knowing when to slip in a ribald joke as a distraction while you size up a mercenary's sword.

Attempts have been made at cosy automation and automated cosiness in the past – Satisfactory is on the sunnier side, providing you enable the right settings, and Shapez 2 has lots of rounded edges. But IDK, there’s something about the ravages of mass industry that doesn’t quite gel with zoomorphic raccoon baristas and other such wholesome trappings. Have you ever encountered a cuddly smokestack? How about a cuddly just-in-time network?
Combine cosiness with automation, and a lot of the time, you end up with some kind of macabre joke, like Palworld. Or at least so I thought before I discovered Sweet Transit, out now, which seemingly resolves everything by means of a hearty injection of trains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.


Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.

Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.

Well, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn't, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It's more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.

Can you ever truly have too much of a good thing? If you’re a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan, this question must have sprung to mind at least once in recent years. Because in truth, the good things have been coming thick and fast.
2022 brought arguably the series' best beat 'em up ever in Shredder's Revenge and gave us a trip down memory lane with Konami's excellent Cowabunga Collection. Then last year saw things were taken in a brave new direction on the big screen with Mutant Mayhem, the Dimension Shellshock DLC brought roguelike action to Shredder's Revenge, and we got confirmation that a Last Ronin game was in development at THQ Nordic (albeit not for Switch). In short, the phrase "I love being a Turtle" had never rung truer.

So let us instead use the semi-public "technical test" as a portentous looking glass from which to discern whether this hell-hopping sequel seems promising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has revealed a new setting for Fortnite that allows players to hide emotes the company considers "confrontational." This doesn't outright ban these emotes from the game and those with them can still use them, but if someone has this new setting turned off, they won't see others use them. 
Called "See Confrontational Emotes," players can choose whether they want to see emotes like "Laugh It Up," "Take the L," "Whipcrack," and "Make It Plantain" from anyone, from friends in a party, or never. Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. 
This new setting can be found under "Social Privacy" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/23/metaphor-refantazio-gets-october-release-date-in-new-gameplay-trailer"/>
        <updated>2024-04-23T12:47:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. 
Dubbed "The King's Trial," this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. 
Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. 
If you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. 
The trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.
Here's what the Collector's Edition looks like: 
Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

We get a look at a new rural town and the activities you can get up to, like bounty hunting. Travel on your magic mech is compared to "camping", which I wasn't expecting. And there's lots of combat on show, with transitions from real-time to turn-based battles outlined in a bit more detail. Oh and it's coming out in October, which gives me plenty of time to clear my JRPG backlog before this inevitably takes over my entire existence for the foreseeable.

Just when we thought we were out, The Pokémon Company drags us back in. We don't have room for another giant Pokémon plush and yet the 59-inch Slowpoke (which you might remember came to Japan back in 2021) has us wondering whether we could make just a little bit of space for this gentle giant.
Now, this one actually came to Pokémon Centers a few years back, but the upcoming restock means that all those who missed out now have a chance to pick one up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s it like to watch a smash hit TV show set in the backyard of a game you’ve made? It’s a question which Fallout: New Vegas project director Josh Sawyer is uniquely qualified to answer.
“The show really does capture the aesthetic of Fallout 4 and 76, while also feeling like it is set on the West Coast,” he says. “If you’re a fan, then you can see where the plot elements have been pulled from in previous entries. And if you’re new to it, thankfully, those plot elements are fairly straightforward. So I think it’s a good show for fans and a good show if you’re new to it, even though there’s a lot of stuff going on. I’m certainly interested to see where they’re going in the second season.”

The trouble was, all my friends liked football and I have an abiding hatred of popular things, a hatred that has obviously served me well during my later career as an online news journalist. I played hockey instead, which is the superior sport in that you get a big nasty stick, but also relatively niche because you need more equipment.
Still, I've enjoyed rediscovering football in videogames, and especially videogames that don't treat football with much respect. You may have played or at least heard of Behold The Kickmen - now, here's free downloadable Itch.io offering Cereballers to stick the boot in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the introduction of Fortnite Festival, Epic's rhythm game within the chart-topping Battle Royale, there's more incentive than ever for musicians to have their likenesses added to the game. The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.
Fortnite Festival Main Stage: 4.23.24 pic.twitter.com/dxaQBsqD4A
April 22, 2024
Eilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.
Eilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for "What Was I Made For" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game. For more Fortnite, check out the current Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover and read about the upcoming Star Wars event.

Partnering with IGN, the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase will air live next Monday, April 29, at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. The event will feature "epic trailers, fresh gameplay, and new reveals," according to the announcement blog.
This announcement is brought to you by great indie games 📣

They've also given a heads-up on some games we can expect to see. Vampire Survivors, which cracked our top ten games of the year back in 2022, has been on the platform for some time now, but recently announced a new expansion featuring weapons and characters from the Contra series. Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
For more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.
You can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel. The showcase will also be available in American Sign Language.
What are you hoping to see from the showcase? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until I played Tales Of Kenzera: Zau I figured people had run out of ways to make original platformers, but an Afrofuturist story-in-a-story framing for a mythological platformer about healthy ways to deal with grief sure did teach me to not underestimate human creativity. I really liked a lot about Tales Of Kenzera, and got annoyed by a bunch of stuff too - and the division seems to be that a lot of the former falls on the story and design side, and the latter on the mechanical side, which I guess isn't ideal for a platformer. But still, I think it's worth persevering.

In Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios, the use of the word "Tales" is more literal than it initially seems. To kick off the events of the game, protagonist Zuberi reads a book written by his late father about a place called Kenzera. He uses fiction to cope with his grief, just as the player might do with the plot of the game, and as the studio founder, who lost his father as well, did when creating the story to begin with. While combat and map design in Tales of Kenzera falters at times, th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company that recently sold Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive for $500 million, has announced its plans to split into three individual, publicly traded companies. As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed mass-layoff-manufacturing corporation Embracer Group are dividing into three companies, which will be listed separately on Sweden’s stock exchange. Those companies are: Asmodee Group, which comprises Embracer’s tabletop games biz; Coffee Stain & Friends, an evolution of the existing Coffee Stain publisher, who will pursue "a dual focus on indie and A/AA premium and free-to-play games for PC/console and mobile"; and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends, “a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, as well as the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties, among many others”. 

After writing roughly 100,000 posts about Embracer’s butchering of vast swathes of the games industry, this is surely my chance to raise a cheer and celebrate the conglomerate’s unglomming with a cool glass of turnip juice, but it is Monday, the man next door is shouting again, and I am tired - so tired that only ill-suited Simpsons references come to mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rising Up is a free, sub-fifteen minute browser game that’s a bit like Streets of Rage, where you play a balding office worker and beat a giant scanner to death within the first 30 seconds. This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.
Created by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to find a new flat in London. This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a "studio apartment". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. 


Lucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must "draft" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.

Sometimes the creature manifests as a proper monstrosity, with B-movie prosthetics and sound effects, and sometimes, it's more of an... unfathomable annoyance, like a nose that won't stop running, or a single player game that requires an internet connection. In either case, the Maw must be sated, and fortunately, there are quite a few appetising video-or-computer games out in the next seven days, with at least one behemoth landing on Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie series that started in 2020 has delivered entertaining adventures starring everybody's favorite Blue Blur and his ever-growing stable of friends. One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the spiritual successor to a classic JRPG called Suikoden, and it came to be thanks to a very successful Kickstarter campaign. As someone with little knowledge of Suikoden, I went into Hundred Heroes thinking it was going to be a dense, old-fashioned, and slightly impenetrable time. And yes, some of it is annoying and obtuse and will almost certainly suit veterans who enjoy those quirks, but it has a surprisingly easy going nature. Hundred Heroes accomodates new players like me with combat that's simple to grasp and a story that's emotional and sprawling and absolutely worth your time.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” A small child dressed as legally distinct Sailor Moon chirped this trite little phrase at me about an hour into Rabbit and Bear’s Suikoden successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. I’m not sure when I realized the adage applies to Hundred Heroes itself as much as it did to whatever the child was talking about.

While visiting Massive Entertainment to be among the first to get my hands on Star Wars Outlaws, I enjoyed playing through stealth sequences, shootouts, conversations, and open-world speeder gameplay. However, one piece of the Star Wars Outlaws puzzle I did not get a chance to experience firsthand is the space gameplay. Thankfully, in addition to playing a chunk of Star Wars Outlaws during my time in Malmö, Sweden, I also had a chance to ask the developers how the game works once you jump into your ship and leave the planet or moon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Final Fantasy 14’s next massive expansion, Dawntrail, arriving this summer, Square Enix recently put out a graphical benchmarking tool. Dawntrail’s benchmark is especially noteworthy as it’s the first time we’ve really been able to put the MMO’s much-anticipated graphical update arriving with 7.0 into practice and see what sort of demands it might make on our hardware by overhauling the 10-year-old game’s visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Long-term readers might have discerned that I haven't been well for a very long time. I have various ailments, of which we all suffer, and it turns out that a mere five years of clinging on by your fingernails sometimes leads to some actual treatment for... all of them. Wild.
So while there've been a lot of interesting looking games in the shortlist lately, these last few weeks have been entirely too interesting for me personally. Piecing It Together is nothing more or less than 3D jigsaw puzzles. I've never even liked jigsaws, but it turns out that was exactly the kind of game I needed.

It'll reduce the infection frequency of dragonsplague, which is spread when pawns mingle with other pawns online, and make the symptoms more obvious. Pawns already get glowing eyes when they're dragonsplagued - I guess they'll be all the glowier in future.

I think this is partly because games discourse is cyclical, and partly because writing and talking about the same things a lot means that when a neater phrase for something complicated pops up, it gets assimilated quickly. Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any.

This update, which reveals the studio is still hard at work on the game, arrives after an unspecified number of layoffs hit Telltale Games last October. 
"We've been quiet because we've been heads down, focusing on the promise of [The Wolf Among Us 2]," the update reads. "While we can't give a big update yet, here's a little something for you: in-progress shots from the current build. The work continues. The Fabletown gang will be back. Thanks for being fans." 
The four in-progress shots from the current build of The Wolf Among Us 2 can be viewed below: 

The Wolf Among Us 2 was originally due out last year but was delayed out of 2023 in a March update from the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 
Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say "Pah! You should play Stardew Valley."
1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video has renewed its Fallout television show for another season, confirming that Season 2 is in the works following an earlier report. This news arrives just over a week after the series' release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Fallout review, so we're excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2's production. 
Wouldn't want to keep you on the edge of your seat, now, would we?

Fallout joins a string of other hit Amazon Prime Video series currently airing on the streamer service, like The Boys (with a new season dropping June 13) and Invincible, which just had its second season wrap up. It also joins a string of other successful video game adaptations, like HBO's The Last of Us, which is getting a Season 2 next year, Peacock's Twisted Metal, Netflix's Arcane, and Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
Fallout Season 1 is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

Serving a German audience, the streaming portal shut down in 2013, but that wasn't the end of the story. This week, a suspected operator of the site and an accomplice were charged by German authorities. The long delay is noteworthy but also lucrative; a Bitcoin haul with a current value of €3 billion was seized recently.

There's a new public event to try, as well as combat readjustments that'll be drip fed over the course of the test period. Anyone who owns the game on Steam can give these things a go, which is a bonus, too. I think I own it? I genuinely can't remember. Anyway, yes, maybe I'll hop in and see how things have changed since, errr, launch.

In fact, player reception to the recently released Beach Properties DLC has proven so un-sunny that both developers Colossal Order and publishers Paradox Interactive have issued a joint statement apologising for the state it launched in.
The letter, addressed to Cities fans and signed by Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen and Paradox Interactive deputy CEO Mattias Lilja, also promises refunds for anyone who bought Beach Properties. Or, in the case of those who got it through snapping up Skylines 2’s Ultimate Edition, compensation in the form of three Creator Packs and three radio stations. The contentious DLC is also going free to anyone who’s yet to put money down.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance faced a rocky launch in 2018, with outlets (including Game Informer) criticizing its widespread bugs and general lack of polish, but it found success regardless, going on to sell two million copies and release a slate of DLC and updates. Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it's too early to speak to any performance issues, it's clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhorse have revealed Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, sequel to the 2018 open world action-RPG which you will likely remember for a couple of reasons: 1) its ostensibly faithful but inevitably skewed representations of race, gender and class in medieval Bohemia, which were amplified by its creative director Daniel Vávra's qualified endorsement of Gamergate, and 2) being a moderately entertaining, buggy and mucky chivalric fable in which you have to worry about keeping your sword sharp and eating food before it rots. 


Going by the announcement video, the new game is the same game but with more cash to burn. It's the work of 250 people, with Jan Valta returning as composer. According to Vávra, "what we are making now is what it was supposed to be in the beginning, but we were not able to do it because we didn't have enough resources and experience."

The free-to-play survival shooter hit early access on Xbox way back in June 2018 - almost six years ago - and subsequently made its way to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. And yet, for more than half a decade, no whisper of a PC release was heard - until now, that is.

As such, the latest delay to Jonathan Blow’s time-rewinding puzzle-platformer - which sees its date pushed back two weeks into the middle of next month - feels like a relative drop in the hourglass.

These games will build on the “sensibilities” of Baldur’s Gate 3 in being “immersive experiences shaped by your choices”, but by the sounds of things, they won’t be adaptations of anybody else's narrative or setting. Divinity: Original Sin 3? It’s the obvious call, but come now, free your mind. How about a kart racing game, Larian, or a banging old school mascot platformer? When are you going to make a platform game, Larian?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie. 
The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.]]></summary>

This time Our Nance is heading to Prague, for a sort of old-world-meets-new story about hacking, medieval myths, and a stolen necklace. Nancy is hired to find said heirloom, and interview a bunch of suspects, one of whom is creepy puppet guy up there (there are no screens of Nancy because she never actually steps out from behind the camera in these games; she may as well be a cryptid). I realise this may not be of interest to regular readers of this site, but while I may not have seven keys, I do have one to the back end of this website, so nobody can stop me.

That game is Morels: The Hunt 2, released this week, and as you might guess, it is about finding and identifying various species of mushroom in lush, photorealistic wilderness locations. There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest. It feels a bit like developers Abrams Studios are unconvinced as to the popular appeal of mushroom hunting, and have garlanded the concept with random mythology so as to widen the Venn diagram overlap between "fungi fans" and "people who want to live in cyberpunk Narnia".

Seven months later, Uptobox's Dubai-based owner has just tried to convince a court that Uptobox should be resurrected.

Children of the Sun is hellbent on occupying your mind. During the six hours it took me to hit credits, I was engrossed in mastering its simple, yet wonderfully executed central mechanic. At first, taking down dozens of cultists with just one bullet was a fun gimmick to tinker with. As time passed, I became obsessed with pushing the tools at my disposal to their limits, repeatedly using people as target practice until I had concocted a satisfactory murder plan.

Little Kitty, Big City - May 9

Yars Rising - Late 2024


Wayforward and Atari are teaming up for a 2D Metroidvania spin-off of the 1982 classic Yars’ Revenge. This side-scrolling platformer stars Emi Kimura, a young hacker (using the handle of Yar) who gets embroiled in an intergalactic conspiracy cente…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surreal pop synth of Sayonara Wild Hearts may have been the game that put Swedish developer Simogo on the map for PC players, but for me their earlier iOS puzzler Device 6 stands in my memory as being one of the most distinctive video games I've played. An interactive mystery novel at its heart, Device 6 took full advantage of its mobile-based hardware, asking players to turn and rotate their device to read certain lines of text, and scroll through its chapters searching for audio visual clues to solve its puzzles. I've often lamented that it never made its way to other platforms, even though part of its magic is inherently tied to physicality of its tactile origins.
Happily, after playing a few hours of Simogo's latest game, Lorelei And The Laser Eyes it's clear this equally classy detective story shares much of the same DNA as Device 6. It has the same love of riddles and mysterious, cryptic puzzles, only now they're writ large in a fully explorable 3D setting - a monochrome and maze-like hotel belonging to a reclusive artist. But Simogo's love of text hasn't been diminished in the process. Early on you find an instruction manual for Lorelei And The Laser Eyes within the game itself, which straight away tells you to have a pen and paper nearby to help solve its numerous conundrums. Heck, publishers Annapurna Interactive even sent me a full-blown notebook in the post just to hammer it home. They're not kidding, either. Even the opening section of the game had me scribbling down names, sums and symbols, much like Tunic, Return Of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did before it. Which is just as well, really, as I'll definitely be needing some reminders when I come to play the full version on May 16th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I briefly posted about this in The Maw, but was unsure at that point if SteamWorld Heist 2 was coming to PC day and date with the launch on Switch. That date is August 8th, by the way, and the answer is: yes it is! Though it was revealed at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase earlier this afternoon, strategy action-adventure-with-robots sequel SteamWorld Heist 2 isn't a timed platform exclusive, so that's fun!
SteamWorld Heist 2 is, if you hadn't guessed, a sequel to SteamWorld Heist, which came to PC in 2016. The first was a side-on tactics game where you, leading a team of robots, shot teams of other (bad) robots in turn-based skill-heavy tactical battles. While that all took place in space, the sequel has achieved splashdown, and you'll be chuntering about the seas with a new lead character (Captain Leeway) and a new bunch of crewmates. It's a robot pirate game, in other words.

The studio nailed the tone of Peter, Miles, and their supporting cast, but it was the care put into the rest of the universe that makes Insomniac's universe stand apart. Yes, the Easter eggs and references to heroes like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Black Panther, and more make this feel like an established universe full of superheroes, but Insomniac took things to the next level with its rogues' gallery. 
As a longtime Spider-Man and Marvel fan, I've delighted in watching my favorite villains – and those I rarely think of – pop up throughout the multi-game journey. Check out all the villains in Insomniac's Spider-Man universe below, and…]]></summary>

You have to spend a bit to get the top performance, especially now with memory manufacturers slowing production and SSD makers offering fewer discounts as a result. Fortunately, the 2TB T500 does have a decent discount going at the moment, worth $51:
The T500 takes the title of best high-end PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD for gaming in the RPS best SSDs for gaming guide, and boasts ridiculous sequential speeds of up to 7400MB/s and 7000MB/s for read and writes respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years before she worked on top-drawer point-and-clickers Return To Monkey Island and Thimbleweed Park, Australian game developer Jenn Sandercock was a junior designer on Team Bondi's historical open world game L.A. Noire. Eventually published by Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar in 2011, L.A. Noire took seven years to make and is an especially notorious example of crunch culture and mismanagement. Sandercock joined in the middle of one such crunch period, and wanted to make life a little easier for her exhausted colleagues. "Everyone looked so miserable after literally years of hard work & crunch," she wrote on Twitter in 2018. "So late one night after work I baked 2 cakes for the office. I sent out a mass email & we all took 30 minutes to eat cake and talk." Sandercock began hosting weekly "Cake Days", baking a fresh batch in her own time to share around the office.


Rockstar were unimpressed, however. They thought Cake Day was evidence of poor productivity and, according to Sandercock, badgered Team Bondi leadership into forcing her to only share cake during official lunch hours. "Apparently the higher ups thought our entire office slacked off ALL the time because we had cake once a week," Sandercock wrote. She herself was told "that I was jeopardising my career". Sandercock hasn't let the demise of Cake Day cramp her creative interest in food, however. In fact, she's found a way to combine baking with game design. Sandercock is now the author of Edible Games, a book of recipes and instructions for concocting games out of food, and food out of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.
New #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡

Tune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.

Watch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N
April 16, 2024
It's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.
If that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.
We won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8]]></summary>

As you navigate the galaxy in Star Wars Outlaws, you do so as Kay Vess, a pickpocket-turned-thief who gets in over her head and winds up with a bounty on her head. Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a "resourceful underdog" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.
In the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.
We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb
April 15, 2024
The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.
The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.
Previous Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. 
If you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2017 low-gravity hero shooter LawBreakers is coming back from the dead. However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.
LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. 
Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”
RELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. 
Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!
https://t.co/1COV57FZQ5
April 13, 2024
The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.
What did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/faq/2024/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-roguelike-and-rogue-lite"/>
        <updated>2024-04-13T20:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.
But the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.
“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. 
Rogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”
My hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.
“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”
To read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet series rolls on with the latest expansion. This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online’s Super Nintendo catalog is three games larger today thanks to the additions of Super R-Type, Wrecking Crew ‘98, and Amazing Hebereke.


Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Rise of the Rōnin’s release, Team Ninja has added another strong action title into its vaunted portfolio. The samurai epic, which tells a fictional story within a historical Japanese period of revolution, is one of the studio’s most ambitious titles from both game design and story perspectives. We got the opportunity to sit down with producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Fumihiko Yasuda to probe into how Rise of the Rōnin got made.
One aspect of the game that sets it apart from other Team Ninja titles is the monsters or demonic enemies that pervade its other games are nowhere to be seen in Rise of the Rōnin. Being set against a historical backdrop, Rōnin is limited just to human enemies of various fighting styles.


“This game is based in historical 19th century Japan,” Yasuda explains…]]></summary>

On Thursday, April 18, at 8 p.m. CEST/11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, the Czech studio will reveal whatever it has cooking on its YouTube and Twitch channels. This will be Warhorse’s second title; the studio debuted with the 2018 cult favorite medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance.

It’s anyone’s guess what Warhorse has in store, but there’s a solid chance the new game is a Kingdom Come sequel. Despite receiving mixed reviews at launch, it has gained a passionate following, and it was ported to Switch last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sketchy Fables is a hand-drawn, first-person adventure created by solo developer Alle Jong using 10,000 drawings. And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. 
As someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. 
Watch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


There's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, "Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure." Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. 
It's also "focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries," according to the page. 

As for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later.

I’ve never had much of a green thumb. For years, I largely believed growing a plant required little more than burying a seed in the dirt, pouring water, and letting the sun handle the heavy lifting. Botany Manor asks players to perform those crucial first steps before challenging them to deduce the additional methods necessary to make their seedlings blossom. As I explored the beautiful grounds of a mysterious manor in search of answers, clever puzzle-solving and a serene atmosphere made these scientific exploits a …]]></summary>

However, EA has denied Grubb's reporting, telling IGN, "We don't normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story." 
On Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, "They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me."
He continues, adding, "As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!
