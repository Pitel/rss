Leading those forces is none other than Imurah, a powerful, corrupted Space Marine. 


Imurah is a very different foe from any you'll have fought so far in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. He flies around the arena in which you battle him and hurls all sorts of Chaos magics your way. I really struggled with this boss fight because it's a far cry from the Tyranid scum you've been slicing your way through up until this point. However, you can work around every single one of his attacks if you know what you're doing when you go in.

The Summer Summit is a chance for Jagex to show what it's been working on for Old School RuneScape that's still to come to the game this year and beyond. The game was initially released in 2013 and drew in far more players than expected thanks to its focus as an MMO experience that many remember growing up with before the original RuneScape was updated. As a result, new content for the game took a while to get into a rhythm, but this year leading into 2025 might be the biggest the game has ever seen.

Operations are replayable missions in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 that fill out the story from the campaign. You play as Space Marines working alongside protagonist Titus, doing the jobs that enable him to continue carving a path through the Tyranid forces. However, while they do have online functionality, they're not strictly online-only content. But I still wouldn't advise playing them solo or offline, and I've explained why below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If NBA 2K25 is your first NBA 2K game, you might have slight confusion about finding Ronnie 2K inside the game.


In case you're unaware, Ronnie Singh has been the face of the NBA 2K franchise for many years now, and his active involvement with the community is well-established. Inside the game, you'll want to find Ronnie for a hefty benefit. Once again, he's part of a quest in MyCareer mode that can reward you with plenty of VCs (and it can be earned quite easily).


Ronnie 2K location in NBA 2K25


To find Ronnie 2K, you'll need to create your MyPlayer and start your MyCareer mode save.



Complete the opening scenario where you're competing in the NBA finals.


Wait to be woken up from your dream.


Once you exit MyCourt, you'll head to the Arena.


The Arena will be one of your most visited places anyway, as all the NBA games will be taking place over here.


Ronnie 2K will be standing right beside the player entrance. Go close to him, and press the X/A button to talk to him.


Once you speak with him, it will start the Rebirth objective.

In case you're confused, reach the big Diamond-shaped building located on the left of the map. To make things even easier, track the Rebirth quest, and it will take you directly to Ronnie's location.


Completing the Rebirth objective will help you earn 2,500 VC, which will be extremely helpful in developing your MyPlayer build. I am yet to complete the objective, and it requires you to take your overall rating to 90. So completing the Rebirth objective will take some time, but make sure to not miss out on the free opportunity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent update on the anti-cheat systems in place for Apex Legends and the continued efforts of developer Respawn Entertainment to keep cheaters out of the game, the developer revealed some shocking information about the number of accounts banned. 


In its blog post, Respawn Entertainment explained that more than 6 million Apex Legends accounts have been caught cheating and subsequently banned since the game's launch. What I thought was the much more impactful statistic, though, is the fact that an average of 100,000 accounts are banned monthly. It's not hard to see how you top 6 million with that kind of monthly turnover, and it shows that there's a huge cheating scene around this highly-competitive battle royale title.

One of the top contenders for the coolest characters is the Straw Hat Pirates' very own swordsman, Roronoa Zoro. After all, he has a tendency to act cool and do some badass stuff, though it's probably to hide his clumsiness and knack for getting lost.


That being said, Zoro delivered some of the franchise's coolest and most memorable scenes. Here are 10 of them.

Such acts of cruelty have left many in despair, fueling the resolve of those who resist the government's tyranny. At the forefront of this struggle against oppression is the Revolutionary Army. They have been recruiting and inciting forces to fight against the World Government's injustices, even aiding in their uprising. Here are the key members of the organization.

Seeing as how the story is scattered throughout details in the game, questionnaires held by the official Roblox accounts, videos, and more, it’s tough to keep track of. Here’s the full story of the lore on Dress to Impress, and what’s going on with that creepy nail technician.

There are four large expansions to Catan that enhance the experience and add new rules and content to play with. I've gone ahead and ranked the four expansions of Catan alongside the one variant expansion.


I am typically a fan of shorter synopses for any of my lists, however the Catan franchise does nothing by halves. An impressive amount of content is shoehorned into each expansion, so try not to be put off by the large summaries for each expansion. 


This list does not include scenarios nor any non-commercially available mini-expansions that the publisher no longer sells. You may be able to hunt these down second-hand, but it wouldn't be fair to add them to this list.

As someone who has, over the years, developed something of an obsession with both fictional and more real-life depictions of witches, it’s safe to say that I’ve read a lot of books on the subject. Whether you’re looking for something to escape reality, or something a little more factual, here’s 10 of the best books about witches.


The Witches by Roald Dahl (1983)

There are great movies on TV to watch that you never normally see, and even streaming services shift things up a gear to cater to those of us who want trashy shows or films, provided they're related to Christmas in some way. But books are the best way to immerse yourself. 


With all the thousands of books on the market vying for your attention, it feels impossible to carve out the time you need to go back and enjoy ones you know you loved, pick up another entry in a great series, or sit down and engross yourself in a holiday tale. There are so many different Christmas books you could be reading, ones written for adults with a little drama and festive fun.

Arcane Season 2 picks up where the first season's explosive cliffhanger left off, with the cities of Piltover and Zaun plunging into an all-out civil war.

The rather unsightly first looks at the titular Blue Blur broke the Internet, but Sonic (Ben Schwartz) was redesigned, his live-action blockbuster debut turned out to be a massive hit, and now, his beloved video game series has become the basis for an entire franchise.


Following up both Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and the Paramount+ streaming series Knuckles is Sonic the Hedgehog 3. This time around, Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) stands as the central antagonist, giving Sonic, Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), and Knuckles (Idris Elba) a run for their money.

It's the weekend once again, so it's time to wash off the stresses of the work week and relax with a bit of gaming. But before we settle in, let's recap some of the bigger stories from this week.
First up, it was a big week for 'Switch 2' rumours, with not one, but two making the rounds. The first was that the console might finally be revealed this month (yeah okay, we'll believe it when we see it) while the second unearthed the ongoing rumour surrounding the console's backward compatibility.

Perhaps this weekend will be my chance to go outside, breathe in the rainy Glasgow air again, and engage in some general decrustation of the soul. Or, more likely, stay indoors and play games, because the outside is where other people are, and other people are scary. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekend two of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta has started and it brings a slew of rewards for players who take part in it.


Black Ops 6 Weekend Two beta rewards start from level 2 and go all the way up to level 30. The second phase of the beta will have 10 additional levels to grind and for good reasons.

All rewards in Black Ops 6 weekend two beta


You can unlock a total of eight rewards from the Weekend Two beta:



Reach level 2: Unlock BO6 Beta Tester animated emblem


Reach level 9: Unlock Beta tag spray


Reach level 11: Unlock No Bugs charm


Reach level 15: Unlock Quickdraw emote


Reach level 20: Unlock Squash Operator skin


Reach level 23: Unlock The Truth Lies loading screen


Reach level 27: Unlock Beta Expert animated calling card


Reach level 30: Unlock Bug Smasher weapon blueprint



You can equip these items right after unlocking and Activision has confirmed that these rewards will carry over to Black Ops 6 when it releases on October 25, 2024.


The first weekend of the beta did not offer any weapon blueprints. Instead, it included another Operator skin called Squish. This beta session starts on September 6 and will end on September 9 at 10 a.m. PT.


Reaching Level 30 also unlocks the new Tanto .22 full-auto SMG that comes with the open beta. Along the way, you'd be able to unlock the DM-10 semi-automatic Marksman Rifle at Level 25.


Reaching Level 22 unlocks the Interceptors Scorestreak and the Chopper Gunner at Level 29. So, with all these new additions, the second weekend of the beta will be interesting.

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

Hironobu Sakaguchi needs no introduction. As the father of the Final Fantasy franchise, he's the mind behind one of the most successful and popular JRPG series of all time. With FANTASIAN Neo Dimension reuniting Sakaguchi-san with Square Enix, he's spoken about how returning to his former studio — and to Nintendo consoles — feels like coming home.
In an interview with Famitsu (shared via My Nintendo News and Genki), Sakaguchi and Creative Studio III and Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida (known as Yoshi-P) sat down to discuss the upcoming expanded rerelease of the Apple Arcade title.

Masahiro Sakurai is back with another video, but rather than focusing on specific aspects of game development, he's insteading providing some general workplace advice that we reckon everybody should heed, regardless of what kind of industry you work for.
The advice is pretty simple: don't fight with your colleagues. With the games industry specifically, Sakurai states that it's probably a lot smaller than anybody thinks. Therefore, it's highly likely that you'll wind up working with the same colleague on different projects; even if you've moved to an entirely different development team.

With rumours of a Switch successor announcement ramping up, it's worth keeping in mind that Nintendo still has lofty ambitions when it comes to its current hardware. According to its most recent financial data, Nintendo is still aiming to shift 13 million Switch consoles before the end of the current fiscal year.
How will it achieve this? Well, we know a new special edition Switch Lite is on the way to accompany The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, but according to Dealabs (which is known to provide reliable information on unannounced projects), Nintendo is also prepping a new hardware bundle for the upcoming holiday season.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

When ex-President of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aimé, showed off a portion of his N64 collection on social media, we suspect he probably wasn't anticipating a wave of offers from potential buyers.
Alas, that's exactly what happened. Reggie has remained fairly active on social media since his departure from Nintendo in 2019 (!!), and attracts quite a bit of attention whenever he posts something Nintendo-related. At the end of August, he posted an image of a box containing a selection of N64 cartridges with the caption "Found part of my ⁦Nintendo 64 collection! Reorganizing it all! wonder what hidden gems I have here!" This was swiftly followed by an amusing offer from user 'Omni' @InfernoOmni, who said "I'll buy the whole tub for $7".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

This is a fairly standard feature for a lot of blockbuster games, but in the world of Warhammer 40K there are so many mega-scale battles with pitch-perfect composition that I found it hard to resist hitting pause and taking a handful of snaps every few minutes. With a keen eye (and a beefy PC) you can capture some wonderfully violent moments.

Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is 1959. The cold war is in full swing, television is taking over, and environments have just become fully destructible. What a time to be alive. Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

Literally, they light up like the pilot lights of flamethrowers, like glyphs on a cursed monolith that has been exposed to fresh blood after a billion years of dormancy. When I hear that the aforesaid RPG is set on a "dying space station", I begin to emit a monotonous reverberation, like the mysterious banging recently heard aboard the Boeing Starliner. And when I hear that it's being made by the people behind Shadowrun and Battletech, I extend dozens of independently cognitive motorised tentacles and begin writing a news article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keeping your eyes on the road isn’t easy when the horizon hosts crackling azure nebula; when the voluminous nightglow from the planet below makes even the gargantuan industrial indicators look like so many tiny, twinkling cat eyes. I, a terrestrial chump, cannot help be taken in by it all. But I get the sense all this spacey wonder is just so much unremarkable grease pooling at the rim of a diner plate for my Star Trucker. He’s seen a couple things, that’s for sure. Taken the long way round the spiral arm to slip past security checkpoints and offload cases of booze for off-the-record cash.

They're no longer working on a previously unannounced game called "Snail", say the developers on Xitter. Instead, the studio co-founders Paul Morse and Duncan Drummond (plus "many other talented members") are taking up game development roles with the Steam owners.

The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spectacular demise of Fmovies, Aniwave, and a dozen or more related big-brand pirate sites, has former users asking the same question: Are they really gone forever? With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite malware having an even worse reputation than piracy, until now police operations to take sites down, explicitly because they're involved in both, have been pretty much non-existent. This week, music industry group IFPI revealed Operation Redirect, "the first operation of its kind in Brazil to target illegal sites associated with malware distribution." Intrigued by the announcement, we took a closer look and found plenty of drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you forget to build a graveyard. It happens. When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been distracted by Gamescom, several game releases, the rapid dwindling of the British summer. Or I assume we have, for why else would we not have yet posted about the Steam Rhythm Fest, which began on Monday and runs until August 26th at 10am PT/6pm BRDST*.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently wrote about a game that aimed to recreate the old magic of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, a series of late-night, urban racing games that hadn't had a new (non-mobile) entry in 18 years. Oh, what a neglected niche those indie developers were filling!

Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might & Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based strategy RPG series, which began life under New World Computing in 1995. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been necromantically dreaming of a Callisto Protocol sequel, I'm afraid the monkey paw finger hasn't just curled - it's jammed itself right up your nose and scratched an FU on your hypothalamus. Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps deeply ungrateful of me that, when presented with the squirrel with a gun of Squirrel With A Gun, my immediate reaction is to thrust out my bowl like a ballsy victorian urchin and ask for additional squirrel information. It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.
