Mario Strikers: Battle League is out next month on the Nintendo Switch and apart from the initial reveal we haven't seen all that much of this upcoming release. With this in mind, Nintendo has now released an extensive overview trailer for the game - highlighting more of the gameplay, characters, modifications that can be made to the players, and much more.
The catch is it's all in Japanese. Nintendo normally localises these trailers, but if you just want to see some more footage of the game sooner rather than later, this video that's close to five minutes is still well worth a look.

The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. 
The Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TennoCon, the annual convention and celebration for all things Warframe, is unsurprisingly happening again this year. Digital Extremes, the developer behind the action MMO, will be holding the show on July 16.
On its website, Digital Extremes announced the show's timing and that it will once again take place virtually, promising an "all-day event packed with exciting reveals from the team at Digital Extremes." Despite having to watch the festivities from home, fans of Warframes can still participate in the big day by submitting to the Community Art Showcase. "Sculptures, drawings, digital art, Captura pieces, cosplay and more — we want to see it all," says the submission form for the showcase. Clans can also show off their group's home base with the Dojo Showcase.
Digital Extremes will also be donating to a Canadian charity that has yet to be determined. The company says it will announce the chosen charity at a later date.
At last year's TennoCon, a big cinematic solo quest called The New War was revealed, which was later released in December of 2021. Digital Extremes also announced the development of crossplay and cross-save systems was in the works, though these features have yet to hit the Warframe client as of the time of this story.]]></summary>

A much-requested bundle of items known as the C.O.R.E. Defender Pack is returning to Call of Duty: Warzone in celebration of the Call of Duty Endowment hitting a landmark milestone in helping veterans find jobs outside of their military careers.
According to an announcement on the Call of Duty blog, the endowment's lofty goal of placing 100,000 veterans in high-quality jobs has been reached two years ahead of schedule. Activision Blizzard has committed even more funding to the cause to commemorate the occasion, promising to inject another $30 million into the Call of Duty Endowment. On top of that, it's re-releasing the C.O.R.E. Defender Pack for Call of Duty: Warzone, but it will only be available for a limited time.

The creator of Castlevania, Hitoshi Akamatsu, is a notoriously difficult person to track down. Despite creating one of Konami's most well-known franchises, the director of the three main NES / Famicom games has all but vanished from the industry. Never prone to interviews even back in the day, Akamatsu is shrouded in mystery.
However, in the latest issue of Wireframe magazine, the team has managed to track the life and works of the creator, as well as interview some of the staff members who worked with him at Konami and beyond. We've taken a few excerpts from Issue #62, but we highly encourage you to check the entire article and the entire magazine out for some fascinating insights into the game industry, past and presents.

The Switch has a few quirky Indie wrestling games with retro vibes, which is nice, and the questionable WWE 2K18; the latter was not a high point for the genre, to put it mildly. Those hoping for wrestling action a bit more grounded in the current scene may be keeping an eye on All Elite Wrestling's first game, which now has a confirmed name - AEW Fight Forever.
Originally announced in late 2020, there haven't been many updates during the development to date; we do know that Japanese studio Yuke's is behind the project, a team with pedigree on older titles like WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw. Along with confirmation of the name, AEW Games only stated that it's coming to 'consoles and PC', while releasing two videos. At the top is a reveal of Nyla Rose, and below is a look at Kris Statlander.

A couple of months ago, we reported that one of the most influential video games of all time, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, was up for a spot in The Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame. Quite rightly, many people couldn't understand why it wasn't already in there! Luckily, we don't need to worry about that anymore!
Today, The Strong Museum has announced that the seminal 1998 Nintendo 64 game has been inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside arcade classic Ms. Pac-Man, the hugely addictive and competitive Dance Dance Revolution, and the influential turn-based strategy game Civilization. That's a pretty varied selection that covers a whole range of different genres!

Loot River is a run-based action roguelite with a unique Tetris-esque form of navigation. You must carefully – and strategically – pilot geometric platforms to send your character down gloomy streams to battle monsters and collect loot. 
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Jill Grodt, who scored Loot River an 8.5 out of 10 in her review writing, “Loot River reimagines some of its inspirations' best elements, offering players a chance to sail cleverly through each environment, grow powerful enough to slice up once-impossible threats, and unravel a story that smartly weaves into its gameplay.” Be sure to tune in to the stream to see what the commotion is about.

Keighley first announced the event’s return in March, almost immediately after word of E3 2022’s cancellation made the rounds. Summer Game Fest begins at 11 am Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern, including a live kick-off show. 
It's official: #SummerGameFest will have a big live showcase event on Thursday, June 9, streaming live everywhere at 11a PT / 2p ET / 6p GMT.@geoffkeighley hosts a cross-industry showcase with announcements, reveals and more! pic.twitter.com/iANNRxrgRj
May 5, 2022
In addition to streaming everywhere, Summer Game Fest can be watched live in IMAX theaters for the first time. Tickets go on sale sometime next week. The new partnership extends to Keighley’s other big event, The Game Awards, which will also be presented in IMAX this December. 
Surprise! On June 9, you can watch #SummerGameFest Live in @imax!

Naturally, Keighley hasn’t announced what games will appear at the show, but the IMAX trailer montage featured upcoming games such as Starfield, Sonic Frontiers, Star Wars Eclipse, and The Callisto Protocol. Before you get too excited, that footage may only be for the sizzle reel and not indicative of what will actually be shown.
E3 may not be happening, but the summer gaming event schedule is beginning to take shape. Double Fine and Iam8bit’s indie-focused Day of the Devs kicks off on June 9, The Tribeca Games Spotlight airs on June 10, and the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase was recently confirmed for June 12.]]></summary>

Incredibly, the game has delivered. I'm having fun - albeit with a tinge of unease. Not only does the game act like a blaring reminder that I've lost touch with the Top 40, it's also a bizarre metaverse where nothing is sacred.

The main Summer Game Fest Showcase, which will kickstart the 'season', now has an air date and time - it'll bring lots of games (and commercials for random PC gear) to our eyeballs on 9th June at 11am Pacific / 2pm Eastern / 7pm UK / 8pm CEST.

There are a whole bunch of Metal Slug games available on the Switch eShop, and some other rather fun run and gun titles have made their way to the system over the years. Operation Highjump: The Fall of Berlin will now hope to join the higher ranks in the genre when it launches later this year on Switch.
Developed by Mansion Games, it's had a successful Kickstarter campaign and the page is packed full of GIFs and details on characters, weapons and more. As you may have guessed from the name it takes place during World War 2, and intriguingly aims to blend a variety of styles into its campaign, offering more that just action.

Live today, Patch 1.13 brings with it a ton of fixes not just to quests, but to general things like the game’s UI and some of Aloy’s animations, as well as improvements to the game’s performance and stability. Perhaps the biggest issue is the aforementioned visual shimmering, which has been a player complaint since launch. 
For the uninitiated, the shimmering is an almost glitter-like effect that appears on the edging of objects, robots, and more in Horizon Forbidden West. It makes things in-game look shinier than intended and in most patches since the gam…]]></summary>

It's a year to the day since Save Me Mr Tako: Definitive Edition arrived on Switch eShop, and with an anniversary update and physical version now available to pre-order, we thought it was a great time to revisit this interview with the game's creator. Enjoy!

In late 2018, controversial indie publisher Nicalis released wunderkind indie developer Christophe Galati’s tribute to the Game Boy Tasukete, Tako-San! / Save Me, Mr. Tako! on Switch to mixed reviews. While some players savored the game’s pea soup-tinted nostalgia, others were frustrated by design choices faithful to an era constrained by primitive technology and still rooted in the arcades.

        <updated>2022-05-05T13:55:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neill Blomkamp is helping Gunzilla Games write the narrative for its next game, Off The Grid. 
Blomkamp, perhaps best known for directing movies such as District 9, Chappie, and Elysium, is helping Gunzilla shape the story of Off The Grid, which the studio is calling a cyberpunk battle royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter. Calling it “2.0” makes it sound like the studio is aiming to revolutionize the genre, but of course, that remains to be seen. However, you can get a glimpse of Off The Grid now thanks to a new teaser trailer released today. 


“Dive into the heat of a covert corporate war in Off The Grid, a cyberpunk Battle Royale 2.0 multiplayer shooter where you shape the story and the gameplay,” the teaser trailer’s description reads. “Unfolding on a dystopian tropical island, OTG sends you on a head-spinning assassination and sabotage missions to the greater glory and market share of your chosen faction. Tool up for 2023: it’s about to get bloody.” 
As you can see, Gunzilla is aiming to release the game in 2023. 
Off The Grid seems like a great match for Blomkamp, especially considering many of his movies have focused on the relationship between mega-corporations and consumers. 
“The approach is to try to inject the story in a way where players have the option of engaging straight up in the battle royale or have the option of diving into story and story missions, almost like a campaign that you would be playing to follow a story narrative,” the director told GameSpot. 
He says the three different organizations in the game – the factions that Gunzilla is staying mum on for now – are fighting over a space elevator located on the battle royale’s island. This elevator leads to an asteroid mining operation that has created a lot of wealth, which is why so many of the elite are interested in gaining access to it. Blomkamp elaborates more in GameSpot's interview so be sure to check that out here if you’re interested.

“Fall seven times, stand up eight,” says Trek to Yomi’s hero, the orphan-turned-samurai Hiroki. The line represents not only his caricature-like perseverance, but something players should take to heart if they want to reach the end of this journey. However, I wasn’t always sure seeing the finish line was worth getting back on my feet. The eye-catching art direction can’t hide the title’s lackluster gameplay, empty characters, predictable story, and antiquated design. Indies are typically fertil…]]></summary>

Thought the 3DS was done for, did you? Well, despite Nintendo’s best efforts with the announcement of the 3DS eShop's closure in 2023, the company’s popular handheld is still alive and kicking, and it’s recently seen a brand-new release with Fragrant Story. This odd micro-SRPG comes from an indie developer William Kage and gets the honor of being the very last 3DS game released in both digital and physical formats in North America (and North America only).
So, is it a fitting tribute to the 10+ year run of the 3DS? Well… no, not even close. But! It is a delightfully weird release that’s still worth your time, even if just for the sake of seeing what the last 3DS game is like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trek To Yomi is a stylish side-scroller of a samurai slasher, with an aesthetic that'll have you mashing the print screen key at every corner. Like a seasoned ronin, the combat is clean and refined. The story is simple and elegant. The visuals are straight out of a classic samurai flick. But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits! The lack of enemy variety hurts what could've been a sensational hike - but it's still a trek worth embarking on if you break it up with a few pitstops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive shared its plans for Year 2 of Hitman 3 back in January, revealing the Elusive Target Arcade, a PC VR release, plans for the World of Assassination Trilogy to hit Xbox Game Pass, and a new mode called Freelancer. 
This new mode was set to release sometime this spring but in a new update released by the studio today, Freelancer has a new target window: the second half of 2022. IO Interactive says it sees Freelancer as “the next evolution of Hitman and an entirely new way to engage with the world and characters” it’s built in the World of Assassination universe over the last seven years. Due to how “expansive and involving” Freelancer is, the team says it needs more time to work on it.

GoldenEye 007 for the N64 is a truly seminal video game. It was one of the first examples of the FPS genre to demonstrate just how viable it could be on consoles, with an excellent single-player campaign backed up by a multiplayer mode that's still enjoyed by many to this day.
Times, however, have moved on. Although many still yearn for local multiplayer in a world that's increasingly focused on online play, having to play via a tiny segment of a split-screen isn't the most ideal way to experience a game. Plus, you can see where everyone else is on the map!

RedDeerGames and developer Dev9k have announced that futuristic, romantic visual novel meets racing game Nirvana is coming out on Nintendo Switch pretty soon — tomorrow, 6th May!
Nirvana is a new version of 2020's Nirvana: Pilot Yume but without some of the original game's more steamy, saucy scenes. It's a tribute to classic DOS-era racing games with a story-driven twist, but, sorry, you pop high-speed futuristic racing in front of us, and we can't help but think of F-Zero.

This comes amidst a wave of source code releases for Argonaut Games' BRender engine, which was also used by games including Carmageddon 1 & 2, Star Fox, Privateer 2: The Darkening, Queen: The eYe, and and Croc.

Ganryu 2 - Hakuma Kojiro recently launched on the Switch, and although its Shinobi-style retro-flavoured action showed plenty of promise, its release was undoubtedly tainted by some severe frame rate issues. In our own review of the game, we stated that "it’s so confusing a technical train wreck that we can barely make sense of why it's been released in this condition". Although we thought the game had potential to be a commendable entry to the action-arcade genre — and a worthy follow up to Visco Corporation's 1999 Neo Geo original — we ultimately awarded it a 4/10 in its launch state.

The expansion came out on PC earlier this year, but the team is working hard to iron out all of the bugs to ensure a smooth launch on consoles. The new expansion brings new maps, new survivors, new items, and a ton more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go on, tell us.
Nintendo Switch Sports has almost been out for an entire week now, so we thought we would check in on the Nintendo Life community to see how everyone is getting along with the game.
We're wondering what sport you've played the most so far? If you need a reminder - this six-in-one collection currently includes tennis, bowling, chambara, football (soccer), volleyball and badminton. Golf is also on the way in a future update, but as it hasn't been added yet, we're going to have to, unfortunately, exclude it from this poll in this particular case.

Those games allowed us to live out our greatest Star Wars fantasies and let us participate in the most fantastic moments of the Star Wars universe. Some let us clash lightsabers in heart-pounding duels, make a desperate stand against the empire with a scrappy group of rebels, or even choose between the dark and the light sides of The Force. The prolific nature of Star Wars in games has produced countless exciting scenarios and compelling stories, though some of the best moments happen to have existed outside of the game.

Wii Sports and its Resort follow-up were watershed moments for motion-control entertainment. Sports simulators usually underscore realism. And yet Nintendo’s family-centric approach to the genre imbued a selection of competitive activities with accessible interactions, lighthearted art direction, and catchy jingles. Switch Sports attempts to replicate that magic for a contemporary audience with sleek visuals, minigames that feel distinctive but familiar, and avatar customization coupled with ranked multiplayer. Switch Sports is a slam dunk choice for gatherings, but a lack of mechanical depth and rep…]]></summary>

For UK folks, you can now double your Steam Deck storage (!) for £47, or triple (!!) your storage for £132. Meanwhile, over in the US, you'll pay $65 or $136, respectively. Either way, you're getting a good deal on a high performance Micro SD card that works surprisingly well* in the Steam Deck versus the built-in SSD.

Blizzard Entertainment has released a new developer blog post detailing Week 1 of the Overwatch 2 beta, including goals, progress, updates on Ranked Mode and queue times, and more. 
Heading into the beta, we already knew about some big changes coming to Overwatch 2. Perhaps the biggest change was the standard drop from 6v6 to 5v5 in PvP modes. Beyond new maps and modes, we also learned that Doomfist will no longer be a damage hero and will instead be a tank, and we previewed some big changes coming to the build of Orisa, too. Right before the start of the Overwatch 2 beta last week, Blizzard also released an FAQ to answer any questions players might have before jumping. Now, after the end of Week 1 of the beta, the company has released a new blog post detailing what it’s le…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The roster for All Elite Wrestling’s upcoming console game AEW Fight Forever got two more additions today. 
Today’s All Elite Arcade stream hosted by AEW stars Evil Uno and Adam Cole revealed models and gameplay for Kris Statlander and former Women’s Champion, Nyla Rose. It also confirmed that referee Aubrey Edwards (who once spoke to us about her career in games and wrestling in this interview) along with other officials will be present in the game. You can watch Statlander and Rose fight it out in the pair of trailers below:




Evil Uno further confirmed the game’s final title and announced it’s coming to PC. Fight Forever had been previously slated for still-unspecified consoles. 
AEW Fight Forever was first announced in November 2020 and is being developed by Yuke’s, the studio behind decades of WWE games. AEW has billed the title as a WWF No Mercy-inspired arcade-style grappler, with that game’s director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita contributing to development. Fight Forever will also have a story mode. Over the last year, AEW Games has slowly revealed the roster via video clips of in-development gameplay. The roster is rumored to consist of around 50 names. Excluding today's additions, the wrestlers officially confirmed so far are:
Chris Jericho
Kenny Omega
Hikaru Shida
Darby Allin
Jungle Boy
Thunder Rosa
The Young Bucks
The game is reportedly scheduled to release sometime this year, with September being the rumored launch window. Neither AEW nor Yuke’s has confirmed a release date.]]></summary>

The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.


For those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.

That’s because Warped Kart Racers is a new kart racer coming to the premium iOS service that will let you race as Hank Hill, lover of all things propane, from King Of The Hill. He’ll be joined by other cartoon characters such as Peter Griffin from Family Guy, as well as Stewie, Stan from American Dad, and more, as first reported by Eurogamer. In fact, Warped Kart Racers will feature five characters from Family Guy, five from American Dad, five from King Of The Hill, and five from Solar Opposites. 
You can check out the Apple Arcade trailer below:


As you can see, it features multiple characters from the TV series mentioned above, and you’ll be able to race around 16 maps as them. It also includes “tons of customizations,” such as different outfits for each character, wheel types, glider types, and more. Plus, you can play with up to eight friends in online multiplayer. 
Warped Kart Racers does not yet have a release date, but the trailer says the game is coming to Apple Arcade this month, so it sounds like you won’t have to wait long to play.

I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.

Revealed on Twitter yesterday, Hitman 3 game director at IO Interactive, Mattias Engström, will direct Crysis 4. He’s wasting no time, too, because Crytek says he begins work on the new first-person shooter this week. 
We are happy to announce that Mattias Engström, known for his work as Game Director for Hitman 3 at IO Interactive, joins the Crysis family as Game Director for the 4th installment in the Crysis franchise, starting this week. pic.twitter.com/hHkOrXIAt6
May 3, 2022
Engström is a great get for Crysis 4, especially considering how well Hitman 3 turned out. You can read our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Hitman 3 review to find out why we gave it a 9 out of 10. If you haven’t yet played Hitman 3, you should, and if you’re excited about Crysis 4, you can play through the first three games in the Crysis Remastered Trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Disney Plus series hitting the service on May 27, follows the titular character following the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. A new trailer provides another look at the trials Obi-Wan will face, including confronting his former apprentice. 
Kenobi is on the run, looking to find, protect, and train Luke Skywalker, son of his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker. He must also find refuge away from the Inquisitors, an Imperial group of elite soldiers looking to find him and kill the remaining Jedi. It looks like it’s going to be a great time, both as a new story in the Star Wars universe and as a return to beloved characters like Ewan McGregor’s Kenobi and Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker turned Darth Vader. 

We get a glimpse at both Vader and the Inquisitors, as well as new looks at Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, his uncle, and more in a new trailer released by Disney today to celebrate Star Wars Day. You can check it out below: 


As you can in the trailer, the Inquisitors are on the hunt and they won’t stop until they can bring Kenobi to their master, Darth Vader. And speaking of Vader, we get a quick glimpse of him putting on the pieces of his iconic suit right at the end. Here’s hoping he’s suiting up for Kenobi vs. Skywalker Round 2 because that’s something we really want to see. 
To accompany the trailer, Disney has also released a new poster for Obi-Wan Kenobi that features both the titular character and Darth Vader and it's very dope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is May 4, which means it’s Star Wars day, and to celebrate the occasion, TT Games is releasing two new character packs for its latest game, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. 
More specifically, characters from The Mandalorian and Star Wars: The Bad Batch will hit the game today. In total, these two character packs bring 10 new playable Lego-fied characters to The Skywalker Saga.


For the uninitiated, The Bad Batch is a spin-off of The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian is a sci-fi western that centers on a very Boba Fett-like Mandalorian whose job is to protect a young member of Yoda's race (AKA "Baby Yoda"). If you haven’t yet watched Season 2 of The Mandalorian, you should try to avoid today’s DLC because the characters from the new Mandalorian pack are based on Season 2 of the Disney Plus series. 
“Warner Bros. Games celebrates Star Wars Day with the launch of two new DLC packs for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga – The Mandalorian Season 2 and Star Wars: The Bad Batch,” a press release reads. “The Mandalorian Season 2 pack will include Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand, and Moff Gideon. Star Wars: The Bad Batch character pack will linclude Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo.”
If you own the Character Collection Pack for the game, you’ll receive both of today’s packs as well as the packs based on Season 1 of The Mandalorian, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Classic Characters, the Trooper Pack, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. You can also purchase each pack individually. 

TT Games says Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which was released just last month, holds the record for the biggest Lego game launch ever. You can read Game Informer’s review of the game here. 
Are you excited about these new character packs? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never been one for playing aggressively in turn-based tactics games. I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. 
Thankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.

Well, the game’s development team have taken to Twitter to announce that Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time Remake will be delayed indefinitely, which seems oddly fitting considering the game is about messing with time. It was meant to launch this year, but the game’s already been delayed indefinitely once before.

For this round of testing I am looking at the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS versus Ubuntu 22.04 LTS performance on AMD Ryzen and Intel Core industrial PCs from OnLogic.

Last week Naka took to Twitter to air his displeasure at Square Enix's treatment of him and the game, concluding by saying that he believes "Square Enix and Arzest are companies that do not care about games and game fans."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month's news that original creator Ron Gilbert is making a new Monkey Island is the surprise of the year so far. For Gilbert, his involvement has apparently brought a lot of comments, and an expectation that whatever he's making will line up with comments he's made over the past twenty years. 

Not so, says Gilbert. On the subject of his previous comments, he says "None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody."

In September of 2020, Ubisoft announced that it was remaking The Sands of Time, this time with Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai handling development. Originally set to release in January of 2021, Ubisoft revealed toward the end of 2020 that the remake had been delayed two months. Just three months later, Ubisoft announced that The Sands of Time was delayed indefinitely and that’s when fans began to wonder what was going on with this remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech G502 Hero is the most popular gaming mouse on the market, not to mention the RPS reader's choice and our current 'best gaming mouse overall' - so it's exciting news that it's going cheap on Amazon UK today. 
£29.99 is the cheapest we've ever seen this mouse, beating out last year's Black Friday price, and it's also 63% off its UK RRP. That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. 
If you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year.

Blizzard Entertainment has pulled back the curtains on its rumored Warcraft mobile game, revealing that it’s called Warcraft Arclight Rumble and features an “extensive single-player campaign, co-op play, and PvP.” 
Unveiled today in a new cinematic trailer that you can watch below, Warcraft Arclight Mobile is a strategy game coming to iOS and Android devices in select regions later this year. Blizzard says it’s been designed from the ground up for mobile devices, and it’s set in the Warcraft universe. As the trailer below reveals, it seems like Warcraft Arclight Rumble is an arcade game of sorts that heroes and villains in the Warcraft universe play in pubs and the like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After coming out of the gates with a bang, Halo Infinite has seen its share of quiet months. Some events have kept players coming back, but fans have been left wanting for some time now. Hopefully, that all changes today as Halo Infinite Season 2 is here, and we're streaming the fun live starting at 2 p.m. CT over on Twitch!
Watch on Twitch!
Join Game Informer Halo fan Alex Stadnik as he hops back into developer 343 Industry's latest title to go hands-on with all the new additions. One of the main draws of the new season comes from the two new play spaces fans will slay each other upon. First up is Catalyst, a smaller arena map that is visually reminiscent of past combat zones such as Guardian from Halo 3. Big Team Battle fans aren't to be forgotten, as they too will be getting a map to wreak havoc on in Breaker. This Banished ship-breaking yard is a sprawling molten space where players will have to carefully avoid some of the lava pitfalls on their way to securing the Gravity Hammer.
New maps aren't the only addition in Season 2, though. Fans will finally get new modes to try out in the form of Land Grab, Last Spartan Standing, and the classic King of the Hill. On top of that, there are more narrative and special events, a sparkling new battle pass, and a more fully fleshed-out version of the multiplayer 343 hoped to release last year. But will it be enough to keep Halo fans happy? You'll just have to join us on today's stream to find out!
If you are enjoying our Twitch streams, be sure to subscribe to the channel to know the second we go live and to gain access to our Discord channel. On top of special shows like today, we also stream every Thursday and Friday to check out the latest new game and celebrate the past with Replay, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Prime is an upcoming animated Netflix series that was first announced in February 2021. We haven’t heard much of a peep about it since, and though we’re still waiting for a proper trailer, a new promotional video provides the first glimpse of the show. 
Netflix released a trailer montage promoting its upcoming slate of kid-friendly animated shows. Sonic Prime pops up at the very end, with Sonic sprinting and collecting rings across Green Hill Zone. Sonic also speaks, giving fans the first sample of voice actor Deven Mack’s performance. You can catch the clip at the 1:49 mark. 


Unfortunately, Sonic Prime still doesn't have a premiere date. We only know that the show consists of 24 episodes and centers on Sonic fighting to save a multiverse from supposed doom. Netlfix's official description of the series pegs it as a "journey of self-discovery and redemption." Other cast members include Ashleigh Ball, Shannon Chan-Kent, Brian Drummond, Vincent Tong, Ian Hanlin, Kazumi Evans, and Adam Narada. 
It’s a great time to be Sonic the Hedgehog. His second theatrical film had the best opening weekend of any video game movie in history, a third film has already been greenlit, and another animated show spun-off from those movies is coming to Paramount+. He’s also got two games slated for 2022. Sonic Origins, a remastered bundle of classic Sonic games, arrives in June, while Sonic Frontiers, the hedgehog’s first open-world adventure, releases later this year.]]></summary>

Like a shorter Black Friday, this can be a good opportunity to pick up some PC gaming hardware at severely slashed prices, so if you’re currently weighing up a new SSD or replacement mouse then it may be prudent to hold off until the event gets underway. And you might not even need to shop at Amazon for it, as some rival retailers like to run their own deals to compete with Prime Day directly.

He is not my favourite character in Citizen Sleeper but he is the one who best represents it. In one scene he explains his deep anti-capitalist reasoning to you. Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.
Throwing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run. Even when the game's own systems of dice and clocks clash with its stories of human interest, it is the people who come out on top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of Shenmue III seemed like a long shot. Eighteen years passed between the latest entry and Shenmue II. For almost two decades, fans were unsure if their favorite brawler would ever return. Then the seemingly impossible happened: Yu Suzuki's Shenmue III Kickstarter campaign amassed more than $7 million and over 69,000 backers. The third chapter in Ryo Hazuki's revenge quest was released in 2019 to mixed critical reception and performed "fine" financially. Suzuki recently voiced enthusiasm for Shenmue IV but primarily wants the game to be more accessible for newcomers.
According to VGC, Suzuki spoke about Shenmue IV at a special event in Yokosuka, the city where the story takes place. Suzuki said that Shenmue IV was created with longtime fans in mind, which might've inadvertently alienated newer players. Despite being satisfied with overall reactions to the game, Suzuki felt that it wasn't a good entry point. Currently, there are "no concrete plans" for Shenmue IV, but Suzuki wants to make sure that it can appeal to a broader audience.
"With Shenmue 3, I really responded to the fans’ voices, so I wasn’t necessarily thinking about making any money,” Suzuki announced at the event. “But since I’m running a company, I have to think about what can sell if I continue. I’ve been seriously talking about it over and over again.” 
Publisher Deep Silver's parent company, Embracer Group, released a statement about Shenmue III's financial success in 2020 during an earnings presentation. CEO Lars Wingefors stated that the third game was a "core niche product." 
There are no confirmed development plans for Shenmue IV. Even so, Suzuki has stated an interest in continuing the series. In other news, Square Enix sold Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal, And More, Including Tomb Raider IP, To Embracer Group.

Billed as a union between Soulslikes and Tetris, Loot River delivers this intriguing combination with style. Every moment swings between slick puzzle-solving and smooth action. Players should expect to continually die in Loot River’s darkly atmospheric levels, with each death setting you back to square one. However, the thrilling gameplay and rippling pixel art make it hard to resist one more run.

Because May 4 makes for a great play on of “May the Force be with you” by way of “May the 4th,” Disney and many other companies celebrate tomorrow as a Star Wars day, and the same goes for Fortnite. 
Like in years past, this year’s May the 4th celebration in Epic Games’ battle royale will bring lightsabers, stormtroopers, new cosmetics, and more to the game. However, the Star Wars celebration won’t encompass just tomorrow because Fortnite is keeping its Star Wars content in the game for two weeks until May 17. 
“Star Wars Day is going on in Fortnite, but not just May the 4th: Star Wars items from years past are unvaulted May 3 until May 17, 2022,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “Use these items in …]]></summary>

Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through. There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.
There's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wataru Hokoyama has been composing and orchestrating scores for TV shows, films, and video games for decades. Thanks to the music he created for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, alongside his mentor of six years, Mark Mothersbaugh, he’s now an official American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers awards winner. 
That’s because Hokoyama has received the Video Game Score of the Year award for Rift Apart by way of the 2022 ASCAP Screen Music Awards. Of course, Mothersbaugh helped create the score as well, but he’s not with ASCAP, so the award, on paper, goes to Hokoyama alone. In a new interview with Game Informer, though, the composer, who also has credits on Thor: Ragnarok, Resident Evil 5, Knack, Halo Wars 2 and Halo 2: Anniversary, and more, said winning this award wouldn’t have bee…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As 2022 continues to be the year of acquisitions, with news that Square Enix is selling Embracer Group three of its western development studios and more than 50 IPs, it seems Sony is still looking to bolster its first-party family.
That’s because the company is now hiring for a Corporate Development Director, “responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions,” and more, as discovered by Roberto Serrano’ on Twitter and reported by Video Games Chronicle. It’s not surprising that Sony is looking to hire somebody like this, especially when you look at the current video game landscape – it feels like every other week, a major acquisition is announced. 
“Sony Interactive Entertainment seeks a highly qualified Director, Corporate Development,” Sony’s job listing reads. “SIE’s Corporate Development Team works closely with SIE’s management team and is responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures. The team sources, evaluates, and completes transactions that are aligned with SIE’s strategic priorities and drive significant long-term value for the company.”
Elsewhere in the listing, it says Sony is looking for someone to drive proactive deal sourcing, including developing relationships with external and internal partners. 
News that Sony is looking for what is essentially an acquisitions director is not surprising – acquisitions have largely defined gaming in 2022 thus far. It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, the following week, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion. Two weeks after that, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie for $3.6 billion and later announced it had acquired Jade Raymond’s new studio, Haven Studios.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have children, or friends or family with children, there’s a good chance you’ve seen Fisher-Price’s “Laugh & Learn Game & Learn Controller."
Between memes, jokes, and more, the controller has gained a touch of infamy online, and now, one Elden Ring player has modded it to be playable on PC, as reported by The Verge. Going even further, they’ve played Elden Ring using it. Controller modder Rudeism (on Twitter) posted a clip yesterday of him using this modded controller to play Elden Ring and while that alone is impressive, what makes it better is that the Fisher-Price controller still lights up and makes all the sounds it usually does. 
here's the Fisher Price Xbox controller in action!
@Wario64 for the off-hand joke that inspired me to make this happen 😂 pic.twitter.com/3OETvcsEsI
May 1, 2022
As you can see in the video above, it’s quite a hilarious mod. As for how fun actually playing Elden Ring with this controller is, well, only Rudeism knows but something tells us it’s going to be a little harder to take down Radahn this way. Imagine dying to Radahn, while he has just a sliver of health left, only to hear a Fisher-Price song begin playing, almost as if to taunt you in your death. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then read about the latest Elden Ring patch, which fixes an infamous Malenia bug. Check out this Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the game’s closed colosseum, where they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies inside.

That’s because Scicluna has created a wonderful digital collection of covers for what-would-be video game comic books, as first spotted by 80LV, and they look absolutely amazing. Ranging from the Crash Bandicoot series, including its kart racing spinoff Crash Team Racing, to Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Resident Evil, and more, these covers are so good we wish the comics were real. Nonetheless, Scicluna’s covers will have to do for now. You can check out a lot of them below: 

If you like those covers, and especially if you like the Crash Bandicoot series, check out Scicluna’s collection of Crash comic covers:

If you’re interested in purchasing any of these covers, you can do so on Scicluna’s RedBubble page. You can follow Scicluna on Twitter and Instagram for more art, too.

Last summer’s challenging action game Eldest Souls gets a beefy – and free – expansion today called Depths of the Forgotten. The update treats fans and newcomers alike to three new locations, each housing a powerful boss waiting to be conquered. Additionally, the expansion introduces a new Boss Shard (with 12 infusions), four new weapons, weapon customization, and additional lore bits to further flesh the story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V poslední době se pravda mnoho důvodů k dobré náladě hledá těžko, nicméně neradi bychom Vás zklamali, nějaká úsměvná či alespoň nadějná témata jsme tedy na tuto Virtuální Bastlírnu opět našli. Co nás tedy čeká?

Kupříkladu jak vdechnout 30 let starým digitálkám nový život náhradní elektronikou, logický analyzátor z RP2040, kde sehnat učebnice programování STM32 v češtině, nové pluginy pro KiCAD nebo jak odemknout naprogramované ATtiny, pokud jde o vážná témata.

Z kategorie úsměvných může působit například ezonávod na opravu LED žárovky na webu zabývajícím se (možná poněkud "alternativním") zdravím, trollení majitelů Tesel otevíráním "palivových" víček na dálku nebo sluchátkové zesilovače s elektronkovým koncovým stupněm, kterému předchází osmijádrový procesor XMOS.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 2. května od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, doražte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing the second game in Supergiant's catalog, Transistor.
Released for PlayStation 4 on May 18, 2014, and PC a day later, Transistor was a very different game for Supergiant to make compared to its freshman effort a few years prior. Development started just a few months following the release of Bastion, and while its first game was a success, the tight-knit studio wanted to prove what it did wasn't lightning in a bottle. In this episode, we discuss the various ways Supergiant pushed against the ever-present shadow of Bastion in the games design and the studio's production methods. We also cover the process of creating a new retro-inspired cyberpunk setting, the unique tactical action combat, and how the studio landed on a voiceless lounge singer named Red and her talking sword, the Transistor, as the main characters.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Magazine Content Director Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Transistor! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding your niche can often be the key to success for smaller developers, but Swedish team Image & Form refuse to be pigeonholed. Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

The Wasteland Theatre Company has even built a stage they say is modelled after London’s Globe Theatre, renowned for its performances of the Bard’s plays. They’re a week late to celebrate Shakespeare’s birthday, but I won’t judge because I can’t even add up properly in Freddos.

I'm not a fan of most fighting games. All too often they have too many elaborate moves, too much memory testing, or they feel like glorified puzzles you have to figure out the one solution to.
Hats Are Not Allowed takes an approach I find far more interesting. Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can't say it's one of the best dueling games ever, but it's the best one I've played for ages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of 12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford’s Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It’s mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don’t need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you’re greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won’t see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you’ll have to go elsewhere.

Oddly enough, Yoshida’s reveal about the development of FFXVI doesn’t come by way of any usual channels like Twitter, a press release, or a development update video. Instead, it comes by way of a new Yoshida interview in a free magazine currently being given away at Uniqlo stores in Japan, as discovered by Twitter user alverich_ff14 and translated by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If, at any point, while playing through the Mass Effect series, you’ve thought to yourself, “I really wouldn’t mind a replica of the Reaper Sovereign ship,” then today’s your day. 
That’s because BioWare and Dark Horse Direct have unveiled a new 14-inch Reaper Sovereign ship replica, and it’s beautiful. What’s more, it’s available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it’s something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don’t have to wait too long to have it in your hands. 

“Reaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,” Dark Horse’s description reads. “This spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.” 
Gentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA’s Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect. 
Are you going to pick up one of these replica Reaper ships? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Nearly a year later, Young Horses, the game’s developer, announced during a Sony State of Play the game would be getting a new DLC. Called The Isle of Bigsnax, the expansion will be free for players who already own the base game. On top of a fresh story, which should take three to five hours to complete according to the creators, fans can expect a slew of new content. And while it’s aiming to release in the first half of 2022, we got an early hands-on look at the game at GDC.
Adding hours of playtime to the original game, Young Horses announced players would receive their own in-game dwelling to renovate. Now you can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, the dev duo that make up Analgesic Productions , seem to make games about scientists. Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”

They're a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they'll flower into a roguelike that you won't be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it's something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.

We manage to talk about a lot of games in a sensible way, and even gesture at serious discussion of how prestige indies can dominate their niche to the detriment of other interesting games.
Also we talk about holes quite a lot.

Personally, I'm hoping we'll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3 too. Here's hoping!

I'm too old and thin-skinned to enjoy the competitive nature of most online FPS games, and rallying together a regular squad of buddies to tackle the world of games as a service always seemed too much like hard work. Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I've seen them take hold in friends and family. But with Dorfromantik, the chill, pastoral village builder from Toukana Interactive, I finally understand the journey towards that mythic 'forever' status.

I had no answer then and I have no answer now, but Turbo Golf Racing is the most interesting of the recent crop of wacky walk-spoilers. It's golf with cars, or Rocket League with golf, and it's launching a cross-platform beta tomorrow.

They use off-the-shelf designs for their pumps and radiators, as do many other companies, but distinguish themselves with good-quality fans, optional lighting and low prices for a major brand. That last point is particularly pertinent today, as their H100X 240mm AiO has dropped to nearly £60 on Amazon UK - a significantly lower price than any alternative that I'd rate as highly and some £25 below this AiO's original launch price.

The appearance of the lower-end Ryzen 5500, 5600 and mid-range 5700X have pushed prices for their more expensive counterparts way down, while the 5800X3D remains hard to find due to its relatively low supply and impressive gaming performance. 
If you were thinking of upgrading, you might be interested to know which retailers in the US and UK are selling each of these processors, and for how much. I was interested myself, so I put together a couple of small spreadsheets to find out - and the results suprised me.

But the game also appeals to a primal, competitive side of me. The one that's desperate to beat my rival Patrick, a bot who's literally programmed to be really good, and Edders, a ghostly version of myself who either strokes my ego or shatters it to pieces.

The update is also dropping for Call of Duty: Vanguard. In addition to new guns and a special timed event featuring Godzilla and King Kong (because of course), this season also sees the debut of some new types of private matches - although Raven have qualified that the latter are temporarily disabled due to “stability issues”. At least that gives us time to download the 39GB update for Warzone, but remember to leave 13GB extra room for the patch to copy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Stanley Parable is a game about a man who leaves his desk one day to discover that all of his most difficult to animate colleagues have vanished. First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.


But most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.

I've given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.
As I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.

Cue a mysterious guide who may or may not be trying to help Trev escape.

It's done cleverly and simply by dragging shapes through zones which distort them in real time but alas, I myself am simple too. Some of the shapes I've accidentally made in Tandis are downright reality-breaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, we were amazed to find EVGA's RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra graphics card going for $999 at Newegg - a $300 reduction from the card's MSRP and a big statement about the burgeoning health of the GPU market. Today, the beefy GPU has appeared for just $889 at Newegg, a healthy $110 reduction. That's a great price for the best high-end graphics card right now, especially for one that's made by the trusted folks at EVGA.

A new video which describes the contents of the next release - Update 6, focused on exploration - also explains why the development team are going to start taking longer between releases. The short answer? Because they're working on releasing version 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crucial P2 is a popular budget NVMe SSD, and today it's decidedly more budget than usual. GameStop are selling the massive 2TB variant of the drive for just $155.99, some $15 less than the cheapest comparable drive anywhere else and way below the $174 that Amazon are charging. That's a great deal for a drive that we wholeheartedly recommend - especially when it's down to crazy-low prices like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Blizzard teased that they'd be announcing something related to Diablo at Blizzcon but that it would not be "what many of you are hoping for". Sure enough, it wasn't Diablo 4 , but a mobile game called Diablo Immortal. Blizzard's warnings didn't stop the developers from being booed on stage at Blizzcon, which seemed harsh.

Now that Diablo 4 has been announced (in 2019) and we've seen all the ways it's catering to fans of classic Diablo 2, perhaps the world is ready for Immortals. If that's so, then good news: it's now also coming to PC, with a free-to-play open beta on June 2nd.

The terribly named Moviedle does something different. The aim, again, is to identify a movie, but instead of a single frame, it squeezes the entire movie into a single second. Get it wrong and you get a two-second version, and so on.

It adds far bigger maps than Galactic Civilizations 3, along with the opportunity to bring more worlds into your dastardly empire or benevolent federation than before. All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher's Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warstride Challenges is an early access FPS that takes the retro shoot 'em up and straps it in a rally car. Each level is a course with straights and corners and demons. You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you've turned every demon along the way into a red paste.
The game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It's quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that's worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it's a payoff you'll remember.

Think of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck software update is a biggun, with Valve adding an arguably overdue lock screen to their handheld PC. This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.


Without the update, it’s possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn’t at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It’s definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.
