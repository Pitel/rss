It's been navigating the murky depths of early access for the past three years but is now prepping for a 1.0 this spring. Prepareations in this case mean "pre-patch" with "final fixes and changes" the development team wanted to make before the big release day comes, and a price increase in two weeks time.

A real Taito gem has been added to the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster has re-released the veteran arcade developers' ultra-cute, ultra-challenging platform actioner The NewZealand Story, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1988, before swiftly being ported to a wide variety of home computer and console platforms. The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized "NewZealand", determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.
You can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdyRIX4q0MY&ab_channel=Shadowserg
What follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It's a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.
The NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito's '80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming's most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.
The NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

In a series featuring over 89 playable fighters, there’s no shortage of options for the player to choose from.

The past few years have been rife with some awesome remakes or remasters of some of the best classic games out there, including but not limited to titles like Bioshock, Final Fantasy VII, Dead Space, The Last of Us Part I, and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. While this trend is only heating up with seemingly more and more remakes/remasters released and announced every year, I'm starting to think about what other classic games I'd like to see get a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.
This is a bit of a tricky one for me because I didn't game as much when I was younger — unless Disney Interactive Studios is willing to revive the 2007 PS2 banger that was High School Musical: Sing It! That's not to say there aren't some classic games that are nostalgic for me,…]]></summary>

It's hard to believe it, but Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a year old today. This Pokémon game took us back to the distant past and completely shook up the formula of what we all expected from a mainline Pokémon entry. And, quite frankly, we want more of what it gave us.
Legends: Arceus sees you get thrown back in time thanks to resident Pokémon god, Arceus, to the Hisui region — which would later become known as the Sinnoh region. The game shoves aside many traditional Pokémon mechanics and introduced various new features, but the hunt to fulfill Arceus' wishes of "seeing all Pokémon" (this god has the power to give you a phone in the Pokéworld, apparently) is the ultimate goal. This is no longer just about catching and battling — you're a full-fledged Pokémon researcher.

A change of the seasons is usually a time for celebration. Whether you’re going from the dead cold of winter to the crisp dew of spring or leaving behind the dog days of summer for the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, the dawn of a coming season can bring with it fresh perspective and rejuvenation. At least, that’s what the changing of seasons is in our world. In SEASON: A letter to the future, seasons don’t necessarily abide by the calendar. People can’t assume they know when a season is going to end, but when it does, far more than just the temperature will change.

Drainus. Whether a ham-fisted portmanteau of Darius and Gradius, or relating to the game’s core mechanic, it’s a silly name any way you look at it. Japan-based developer Team Ladybug, more recently known for the rather good Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, has had the Switch shooting game hardcore waiting eight months since the game’s Steam release, but does it live up to the hype?
Drainus pays homage to many genre classics; a touch of Border Down in its ship functions and styling, a nod to Einhander in the aesthetic of its stage-two train assault, and plenty of Gradius V in its transforming boss phases. The one influence that’s been touted heavily in previews, inexplicably, is Ikaruga, as if it’s the only other title in the genre the mainstream gaming press has ever heard of. While Drainus features a system of absorbing enemy fire that can be returned in a flurry of homing lasers, the execution here has far more in common with Takumi’s Giga Wing than it does Treasure’s puzzle-shmup hybrid, making it a largely erroneous comparison.

It seems Square Enix is once again calling on fans to have their say about what games they would like to see next. In a recent Japanese survey, the company known for the Final Fantasy series asked local residents of Japan what games and genres they would like to see from Team Asano in the future.
Team Asano, in case you need a refresher, most recently worked on the HD-2D Switch exclusive Bravely Default II and also Triangle Strategy. In the same survey, Square Enix asked fans about future remakes and remasters. These were the two questions featured:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How does the Nintendo version hold up?
We've heard requests for a Switch and Xbox side-by-side comparison of GoldenEye 007, so here it is. It's all thanks to our sister site Pure Xbox, and the amazing efforts of video producer Craig Reid (along with a little help from our own video team).
On paper, there are some differences between the two versions in terms of features. Firstly, the Switch version has the ability to take multiplayer sessions online. On the Xbox front, the controls are set up for dual-analog gaming, it's got achievements and it displays in native 16:9 widescreen at up to 4K Ultra HD.

One of the reasons Steam has continued to be one of the most successful gaming platforms is because the team at Valve is so dedicated to creating the best user interface they can. I'm still in the camp that would rather see them making more games than shuttering development to simply focus on Steam (although they insist otherwise), but at least they're constantly making changes to the store that make the game-buying experience more enjoyable. They also make their experimentation process somewhat transparent with Steam Labs, where they "create dozens of experiments around discoverability, video, machine learning, and more."
The newest experiment on the website is called DLC For You, which is a page that compiles information about the DLC…]]></summary>

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.
When GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months. During that time, I accomplished all the missions on 00 Agent difficulty, unlocked all the cheats, and played through hundreds (if not thousan…]]></summary>

The 1997 FPS GoldenEye 007 is considered one of the best influential shooters of all time, especially when it comes to its local co-op mode (I guess technically it had to be local because online play hadn't been invented yet). I missed out on the golden age of the James Bond title because I wasn't even a year old when it came out, but hearing friends and colleagues recounting the magical months and years that followed its release, I'm somewhat envious of a time before online gamer rage. Now's my chance to live vicariously, though, because Rare announced that GoldenEye 007 is available to play on Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles 26 years after it launched on the Nintendo 64.

Mozart and Mario might sound really similar in name, but they don't have too many other similarities — except for that one time that Mozart was in a little-known SNES/NES game called Mario's Time Machine, but let's not worry about that for now.
Our point is that you have to be pretty darn creative to mash the two up into an opera, but that's just what the LA-based Pacific Opera Project has done with their retelling of Mozart's opera, The Magic Flute — or as they're calling it, #Superflute.

I don’t really watch video game shows or streamers. If you want the snarky response, I’d say that I prefer to play games rather than watch them, but that’s not really true. I don’t watch much of anything, regardless of it's TV or movies. I’m too busy playing video games.
There’s one exception to this, and that’s GameCenter CX, a Japanese video game show that started in 2003 and still runs today. Something of a precursor to the various skits and shows today, it involves a comedian named Shinya Arino as he tackles a wide variety of retro games. The joy comes from the dramatic focus on his struggles. He has his successes, but even after two decades of hosting the show, he’s really not that great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It really makes you wonder.
Wonder Boy Anniversary Collection gets a lot right. It features six great titles in the series, with complete region variations and all their alternate console ports, from arcade to SG-1000, to Master System, Mega Drive, and Game Gear — 21 titles in total. It has a bevy of in-game options for finely tweaking the image with CRT filters, screen curvatures, mask ratios, and just about everything else one might desire to recreate the look of an ancient, nigh-on blown-out TV screen. You can also utilise rewind features and access save states and in-game maps if you feel no guilt about cheating your way through many of the game’s labyrinths.
The package includes Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, Monster World II: The Dragon’s Trap, Monster World III, and Monster World IV, the latter two being salient Mega Drive entries among a series of generally excellent games. Presentation is simplistic, but fine, with wallpaper for 4:3 aspect ratios and some nice music accompanying the menus. There’s even an enormous gallery section absolutely stuffed with everything from concept art to arcade flyers, accompanying soundtrack options, and more.

It looks like Ubisoft is planning for a hefty amount of Far Cry in the future. New reports indicate Ubisoft is working on the next Far Cry, as well as a standalone multiplayer Far Cry spin-off.
Reports first surfaced at Insider Gaming, saying two Far Cry projects are in the works. One is "presumed to be" a single-player experience, while the other would be a multiplayer title. Insider Gaming's report claims these titles were originally one project, and were then split into two separate games early in development.
Kotaku corroborates parts of the report. It's also heard that both projects were mentioned in a recent internal Ubisoft update from CEO Yves Guillemot. According to Kotaku's sources, this next Far Cry entry will see the series move from the Dunia engine to Snowdrop, the engine powering The Division 2.
According to Kotaku's sources, Ubisoft has been trying to make a fully multiplayer Far Cry for years. Attempts were then canceled or morphed into other projects. This would be the first time in the series' history that it has completely standalone multiplayer, though, rather than a mode packaged into the mainline Far Cry entry. When contacted for comment by Kotaku about the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on rumors and speculation.

A Far Cry from its predecessors
Though a new Far Cry makes complete sense, the multiplayer portion of these reports is interesting. Ubisoft has at least one big live-service game in Rainbow Six: Siege, but Far Cry has usually had multiplayer as a feature, rather than the full focus.
The company has seen some rough waters recently though, between recent comments from its CEO and cancelling a good number of games and pushing pirate sim Skull and Bones back again.

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have brought its third 7-Star Tera Raid battle into the game, and with it comes a change of pace. The previous Charizard and Cinderace raids favored Pokemon who could tank Fire-Type hits like a champ, but many of these monsters won’t necessarily excel against Greninja. There is one returning champion, but we’ll get to that later.
As has been tradition with the 7-Star Raids so far, you can only catch one Greninja while the event is live. That said, you can freely grind this raid for higher drop rates of rare items like Ability Patches and Bottle Caps. More importantly, since Greninja will always sport the same moves and Poison Tera-Type, you can repeat a winning strategy as often as your teammates are willing to cooperate. Here’s…]]></summary>

Hi-Fi Rush has a lot going for it. The latest title from The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks is an action-rhythm game that blends the two genres expertly. It was practically made in a lab for me, as someone who's very enthusiastic about both rhythm games and Tango Gameworks' transition into action game design. I love its plucky hero, Chai, and his companions (I have a special fondness for 808, the robot cat that turns into the flying ball thing from Mobile Suit Gundam). I'm a huge fan of the game's flashy comic book art and its early-00s soundtrack.
But you know what I love more than Hi-Fi Rush's electrifying gameplay? Its humble release. Just hours after the game was announced, it quietly dropped on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. I have long held that certain gam…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all saw this one coming
HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us has been one of the biggest hits for the platform in about a decade, garnering a staggering 10 million viewers within the first two days of the premiere alone, as well as gaining the most viewers from a first to second episode of any show ever on HBO. It pretty much felt like the show was going to get a renewal as soon as we saw the success of the premiere episode, so the writing was on the wall with this one. We haven't gotten any other official info from the announcement so far — we just know Season 2 will be on the way.
https://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1619017515581018112
As far as the content of Season 2, we know as per the show's creators that it will be covering the events of The Last of Us Part II, as this first season will come to a close along with the first game's story. One thing to consider is that the sequel is considerably longer than its predecessor — over double the length in terms of hours — so there's a chance that they'll need more than one season to tackle its narrative. In an interview from The Hollywood Reporter, Neil Druckmann revealed that they don't have any plans for the show's story to go beyond the games.
Personally, I think my viewing experience of The Last of Us will have to end with Season 1. My curiosity is enough to carry me through as of now, but I don't think I'll have it in me to sit through a whole other season — especially because the story of Part II wasn't my favorite to begin with. As a fan, I'm happy to see the franchise thriving, but I've spent so much time thinking and talking about it, I think it's time to move on for a while after I finish covering Season 1.

Devolver Digital has announced that its vengeance-fueled samurai slasher Trek to Yomi will be released on Nintendo Switch Monday, January 30, following on from its previous appearance on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in the summer of 2022.
Developed by Flying Wild Hog, Trek to Yomi is a love letter to the bloodthirsty-but-stoic samurai epics of yore, and tells the tale of a young swordsman who sets out on a pilgrimage to the titular town, with the aim of confronting the ancient master who razed his village to the ground. Featuring intensely violent side-scrolling action, Trek to Yomi attempts to capture the balletic carnage and aesthetic violence of the many movies that poured out of Toei Studios between the '60s and '70s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kexl_PrUeFo&ab_channel=DevolverDigital
Unfortunately on launch, Trek to Yomi didn't quite receive the smash hit reviews one might have hoped, but it was universally praised for its presentation style, great soundtrack, and fine, if unremarkable gameplay. For fans of the samurai genre, Trek to Yomi is still more than worth picking up, and remains a fine example of a modern-day, Edo-era release — alongside fantastic titles such as FromSoftware's  Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima.
Trek to Yomi launches January 30 on Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PLayStation, PC, and Xbox.

However, the fading memories of the series have not stopped developers Tour De Pizza (a fantastic name, we might point out), as it has this week released its debut title Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer inspired by the Wario Land games!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO's The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. 
Check out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: 
The journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d
January 27, 2023
As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cream 'o' the crop, rise to the top, yeeeah!..
Skybound Entertainment has made a committed financial investment in indie studio MegaCat Studios, the developer working on fun-looking, ring-rocking RPG WrestleQuest.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Skybound Entertainment has not released a figure for its investment, but the site's sources believe it to be in the "multi-million" region. As a publisher Skybound currently holds IPs such as The Walking Dead and Escape Academy, while also owning physical distribution rights for titles such as Cuphead, Psychonauts 2, Untitled Goose Game, Gang Beasts, and more recently Striking Distance Studios' The Callisto Protocol.

Pittsburgh-based MegaCat Studios has released several low-key titles in its young life, including games for retro platforms such as the NES and the Sega Mega Drive. WrestleQuest represents the indie outfit's biggest and most promising title to date, blending strategic RPG combat with the Day-Glo, territory-era world of pro wrestling. Alongside a roster of original characters, WrestleQuest will also star real-world grapplers such as The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter,  Jake "The Snake" Roberts, Andre the Giant, and Macho Man Randy Savage.
It is reported that MegaCat intends to use Skybound's investment to help with the financial side of project development, while also noting that the partnership will give the small studio access to IP and publishing resources. With the release of WrestleQuest just four months away, this exciting venture looks set to propel MegaCat well into 2023 and, hopefully, beyond.
WrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we've started two new things! We're breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

The first time I laid eyes on Onion Assault was on the outskirts of GDC back in 2019. I was having a lunch interview with Bertil Hörberg, the solo developer behind the Gunman Clive series and Mechstermination Force. We were there to talk about Mechstermination’s impending release and how its development differed from the Gunman games. In the midst of our conversation, he decided to give me a sneak peek at something else he was working on. It was a new game influenced by the NES classic Super Mario Bros. 2, which I’m sure most of you know was a reskinning of Doki Doki Panic.
This brief, off-the-record preview was merely a morsel, but as a long-time champion of SMB2, I couldn’t wait to see one of my favorite indie developers find inspiration in it.

We are used to finding game glitches at a pretty early phase in our playtime (heck, opening week for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet saw our Twitter feeds flooded with 'em), but this isn't to say that there aren't more out there. One such example has been brought to our attention today and it is, predictably, to do with Super Mario Sunshine.
Anyone who has played Sunshine is bound to have come across the odd glitch once or twice. Perhaps you saw Mario fall through a floor and plummet to his death, or maybe you found yourself leaping in and out of walls like Marvel's Nightcrawler. Fortunately, most of these are at the 'freaking annoying' end of the glitch spectrum; the other end is reserved for those like the Gelato Beach softlock glitch which was recently demonstrated by YouTuber Gaming Reinvented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

One of the most surprising additions to Bayonetta 3 (and for some, one of the most divisive) was the inclusion of Viola, a brand new playable character that looks and feels completely different to the titular heroine we're all familiar with. Alongside Viola is her trusty companion, Cheshire, an Infernal Demon who is permanently bound to Viola's sword.
Boasting wild visuals and a comical, care-free personality, Cheshire is undoubtedly one of the coolest additions to the franchise (even though it technically appeared in doll form prior to Bayonetta 3) and the good news is that we'll be becoming even more acquainted with the character when Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon launches on Switch on March 17th, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your mind back to December's The Game Awards and you may remember post-apocalyptic FPS Meet Your Maker giving us a closer look at its intriguing combo of raiding and building. Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.

Craig Mazin discussed his hopes for the TV version of The Last Of Us while guesting on an upcoming episode of The Playlist Podcast. Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

Whenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it's time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it's a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.
This is in addition to the current sweepstakes they're still running.
Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth.

This review originally went live in 2011, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Highly revered by countless N64 owners, GoldenEye 007 is often credited with kick-starting the first-person shooter craze on consoles. It not only showed that a good first-person shooter could be crafted for a machine other than a high-spec PC, but arguably also created the multiplayer FPS phenomenon on consoles. In fact, if it weren't for GoldenEye, it's quite feasible that franchises such as Halo and Call of Duty might never have experienced the intense popularity that propelled them into the gaming lexicon.

He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

Fire Emblem Engage has been out for one week now and it is fair to say that we loved it (it did get a 9/10 in our review, after all). While many of us who like to have our games in boxes found no issues with getting our hands on the physical edition, it seems that the popular demand of the title meant that not everyone has been quite as lucky, including the game's lead voice actor.
Brandon McInnis voices the male version of Alear ('The Divine Dragon') in Engage. If you have played the game already or indeed watched anything from the massive pile of promotion that came in the run up to its release, then you will know that this is a pretty big part. The biggest part (if you play with a male protagonist) in fact. Yet the actor recently took to Twitter to share his difficulties in getting his hands on the game's special 'Divine Edition' come release date.

GoldenEye is now available to play on Nintendo Switch. Ah, how long we've waited to type that sentence! After 25 years as an N64 exclusive, Rare's seminal first-person shooter has finally escaped from its 64-bit confines and is now playable via a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription, or on Microsoft's Xbox.
However, anyone who has tried the game already on Switch may well have run into control issues. Frankly, the way the N64 pad inputs map to a modern dual stick controller is a bit messy to say the least, and the default layout is almost guaranteed to have you pressing the wrong buttons and pulling the wrong trigger — at least to begin with. On Xbox, it seems, the controls have been tweaked for dual-analogue control by default, but not on Switch. It's possible to remap buttons at a system level, of course, (and check out the video above to see Alex explain the simple steps), although remapping can be a minor hassle.

Remember in 2020 when the spoon-bending magician Uri Geller publicly apologised for getting Kadabra banned from the Pokémon Trading Card Game and asked Nintendo to bring it back? Well, it seems like it could finally be happening.
According to a story on PokeBeach, a new "sell sheet" for the "Pokémon Card 151" set mentions how the original 151 Pokémon will feature. An "Alakazam ex" card is also named in the set. Geller has shared the following voice message with the source in response to this news - admitting he "was a fool" to sue when Kadabra was "basically a tribute". Here's exactly what he had to say:

In case you missed it, the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Greninja event is underway, and there are two opportunities to catch it. Once you do get one just like the prior event Pokemon, they can be bred! Here's what you get when you do it.
[caption id="attachment_360040" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Bring Greninja and Ditto to a picnic
Just like Charizard and Cinderace, you can hatch an egg with a Ditto and a Greninja at a picnic and create a Froakie. This effectively gets by the "only one Greninja can be caught per save file" restriction for the Tera Raid event.
If you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here. All you need to do is wait and you can create multiple eggs to trade away to folks, or keep for yourself.
[gallery size="large" ids="360039,360037,360038"]
In Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Froakie still evolves into Frogadier at level 16, and Greninja at level 36
The evolutionary methodology is the same as the old game line, so you can evolve Froakie into Frogadier (level 16) into Greninja (level 36) on your own terms, and completely raise a brand new Pokemon.
By default, a hatched Froakie comes with the following moves:
Pound (35/35)
Growl (40/40)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The road trip adventure gets a musical follow-up
Road 96 was originally released back in 2021 by the creators of Valiant Hearts and 11-11: Memories Retold with its big selling point that it was a procedurally generated narrative game. The story took place in the mid-90s, as characters hitchhiked across the fictional nation of Petria in order to escape its authoritarian regime. While the game didn't always stick the landing, it was generally well received, and was considered a successful experiment in trying something totally new when it comes to storytelling in games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYO2XC33tQ
Now, two years after Road 96's release, developers Digixart have announced that they're working on a prequel, which is titled Road 96: Mile 0 and will take place right before the events of the first game. The story will follow two teenagers, Zoe and Kaito (the former is a character players will recognize from the original Road 96), and will switch between them as their journey challenges "their friendship and everything they believe in."
Mile 0 will also deviate from its predecessor in that it will include playable musical sections, and if that music is anywhere near as catchy as the song playing over the announcement trailer, we'll be in for a treat. Road 96: Mile 0 will release on April 4 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's still time
This is your chance to find Greninja in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, as the weekend events have begun. You'll have two chances in total, so don't miss your opportunity to grab it! Here's how to start (and finish) the process of unlocking it, and how to locate it.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Greninja events start
January 27-January 28, 2023
February 10-February 12, 2023
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven't already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="360012,360014"]
Locate the Greninja raid on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing poison icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You'll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="360010,360011"]
Search for a Greninja raid, even if you don't have one available
Alternatively, if you don't want to host a raid (or don't have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Greninja on the list (image silhouette above). As soon as you see it click it: as you'll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Greninja raids show up, wait for the "check for new postings" sign to light up: then press X to search again.

Redemption Reapers, the new tactical RPG from collaborators behind 2021's Ender Lilies, is arriving fairly soon. Developer Adglobe and publisher Binary Haze Interactive announced today that Redemption Reapers will launch on February 22, 2023.
This tactical approach is a fair bit different from the Metroidvania style of Ender Lilies. Redemption Reapers follows a mercenary group called the Ashen Hawk Brigade, fighting as part of humanity's last stand against the evil Mort army. It's a brigade made up of despised warriors who are nonetheless masters of their craft. And as the commander, the player will try to navigate tactical battles and achieve victory, or fail.
Today's gameplay overview goes over just how the Ashen Hawk Brigad…]]></summary>

If you've yet to play Giant Squid's gorgeous action-adventure title The Pathless, now's your chance, because it's finally getting a port to the Nintendo Switch and Xbox next week on February 2. The game is already available to play on pretty much every other platform, including PlayStation, Steam, Epic Games Store, and Apple Arcade. Porting it out to the two remaining major consoles will make The Pathless as widely accessible as it gets, which is a pretty big deal for an indie game.
https://twitter.com/A_i/status/1618655130026393614
In the game, the player takes on the role of the Hunter, "a master archer who travels to a mystical island to dispel a curse of darkness that grips the world." There's an emphasis on smooth, acrobatic-like platforming and making slick trick shots alongside an eagle companion who will help you along on your journey. The game even offers some boss fights to add a bit of challenge, but overall, exploring the open world entirely uninhibited will lull you into a soothing flow state in no time.
Giant Squid is also the developer behind the calming diving game Abzû, and they've managed to further build upon their gameplay systems to create a relaxing yet engaging experience with The Pathless. If you're looking for a short experience to dive into for an evening, The Pathless is a great bet with the average playthrough coming in at around five hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us is still a little up in the air, though
It sounds like Naughty Dog could be getting past Nathan Drake. In a new interview, co-president Neil Druckmann says the studio is "moving on" from the Uncharted series.
Speaking to Buzzfeed, Druckmann started off discussing a potential The Last of Us Part 3. He says Sony has supported the studio in following its passions. Despite the success of certain games, Druckmann says, there hasn't been pressure to keep a series going.
"That's not the case," said Druckmann. "For us, Uncharted was insanely successful—Uncharted 4 was one of our best selling games—and we're able to put our final brushstroke on that story and say that we're done. We're moving on."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh5HV4iic1Y
For Naughty Dog at least, that sounds like a lid on the Uncharted series, or at least for Nathan Drake's portion of it. Though, for The Last of Us, the situation's a little different. The team is currently working on its multiplayer experience set in The Last of Us universe, which it plans to share more info on this year. But The Last of Us Part 3? That's a different question.
"Likewise, with The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not," said Druckmann. "Our process is the same thing we did when we did Part 2, which is if we can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love—just like the first and second game did—then we will tell that story. If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end."
The last Last of Us
While Druckmann's comments indicate Naughty Dog is moving on from Nathan Drake, it could still leave the window open for other studios to pick up the series. Either way, The Last of Us multiplayer is what we know Naughty Dog is working on for sure, as its adaptation keeps rolling on over at HBO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still waiting on that Annette comeback...
Stalk 'n' slasher Dead by Daylight is getting set to celebrate the suitably spooky Lunar New Year, and will do so via a new limited-time event, bringing with it new in-game decorations, a slew of limited cosmetic items, and brand new skins for its Resident Evil heroes Jill Valentine and Ada Wong.
The Resident Evil x LNY collection will give players the opportunity to bedeck Jill Valentine in her battlesuit, perhaps best remembered for its appearances in the Resident Evil Revelations series, while Ada Wong takes a trip back in time for her iconic split-legged cocktail dress and heels combo, which the sultry spy wore for her debut appearance in 1998's Resident Evil 2, and is easily the most iconic of her looks to date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DTFOY9jQgA&ab_channel=DeadbyDaylight
Speaking of which, in addition to these new outfits, a new skin for killer "The Blight" will see it transform into the warped and tragic visage of Dr. William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist responsible for the creation of the devastating G-Virus, who ultimately succumbs to its own horrifying mutations. While most of the Lunar New Year cosmetics are time-limited, these three skins are permanent additions to the Dead by Daylight catalog.
Aside from the Resident Evil content, Dead by Daylight will also be celebrating the Lunar New Year with the new Moonlight Burrow event. This will see the realm decorated in creepy, rabbit-themed iconography, while affording players boosted Bloodpoints and themed rewards. Be sure to keep an eye out for the returning Red Envelopes, which will feature a variety of rare prizes and in-game bonuses. For full details on this new event, check out Behavior Interactive's official blog... Or Look to la Luna.
Dead by Daylight: The Moonlight Burrow is now live on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

At this point I think it's safe to say that Witchbrook is my most anticipated game of all time. I've been following its development for years at this point, and have become a regular lurker on the Witchbrook subreddit, which mostly exists to speculate about when the game will be coming out.  The title is basically a combination of Stardew Valley and the wizard school franchise that shall not be named, and as a fan of cozy simulation games, that's a match made in heaven for me.
Today, the team at developer and publisher Chucklefish — who was also the original publisher of Stardew Valley — took to Twitter to let us know that yes, they're still working on Witchbrook. They also made sure to emphasize in the thread that their in-house studio has a no-crunch policy, hence the long development time. Hey, if waiting a little while longer means no one is pushing themselves too hard trying to get the game out, I am perfectly happy to wait.
https://twitter.com/Witchbrook/status/1618646484601405441
The most recent update we got was in June of last year with some new screenshots and a Steam listing, and even that was the first news we had heard about the game in two years. We still don't have any idea how far out Witchbrook really is, but thankfully I have some other cozy games like Disney's Dreamlight Valley to tide me over for a while. If you're interested in checking it out, you can wishlist the game on Steam and follow along on Chucklefish/Witchbrook's socials to keep up with any more news that might be coming our way.

Update #2 : GoldenEye 007 is now live on the Nintendo Switch Online service and it seems there's no need to worry. Sound the gong — everything sounds as it should!

Update : Digital Foundry’s John Linneman has stressed that while he "doesn't know" the exact details, as speculated elsewhere, this could be down to emulation issues.

Today they launched I Commissioned Some Bunnies, where once again they have commissioned artists to draw pictures with hidden animals to find. Still a big fan of that casual descriptive naming scheme. And yup, the pictures are nice, and the rabbits are hidden, and I'm happy to have spent £3 on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of "What the hell is this?", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: "Wooooaaaah."
Consider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…]]></summary>

One of the best non-mechs I've tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it's down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

One that doesn't feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they've ever been before.

After repeatedly stating that this evening's Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It's a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there's an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it's out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Xbox and Bethesda's Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It's directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang's latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fast-paced game that's all about reflecting bullets back with a katana sounds great to me, a known fan of parrying projectiles. I bought new indie game Agent In Depth within 20 seconds of seeing it. Then I played it. Oh no. I feel old. Am I too old? What I can tell you is, if you like fast-paced action platformers with bullets to parry, instadeath to punish you, and no checkpoints to support you, you might enjoy this. It's only £2 to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There's nothing confirmed yet so we'll have to wait and see,” she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
"Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007," a press release reads. "Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you'll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone."

Given that Xbox's 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn't surprising.
However, the financial results state that this 12% decline is "partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions." Xbox hardware revenue has also declined 13%. During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Xbox's monthly act…]]></summary>

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe "who was in a dating relationship with the defendant." 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland's attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year's High On Life.]]></summary>

Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn't, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future.

These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today's example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That's an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we'd be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they're achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn't want to live in any of the books he's been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn't want to be in them because you'd only end up being a side character, and that's boring.

"Infected" brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week's 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network's history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the "largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network," which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

        <id>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mahokenshi-review</id>
        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mahokenshi-review"/>
        <updated>2023-01-24T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. 
It's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.

Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it's all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it's coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

It's still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It's such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it's out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they're also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer's most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That's a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn't an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It's a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven't seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one's a citybuilder, and I've been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I'm not sure what's going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I'm glad it's Build that's coming out first. 
After all, it's been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That's right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it's a mining and tower defence 'em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it's really something special.

Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It's a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it's called SteamWorld Build. I've played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it's a little bit good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that "Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy."

Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She's also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company's ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: 
pic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59
January 21, 2023
It's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE's version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena's career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it's been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it's clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward's tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if "no HUD" is any indication, it'll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

A list of the game’s achievements published on True Trophies includes one that hints at another way to see out the revised adventures of Isaac Clarke, instead of just landing the bog-standard ending. Thankfully, there’s not much more info beyond its existence, so at least the extra ending isn’t ruined and you’ll be able to find out what it means for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[343 Industries "will continue to develop Halo now and in the future," says studio head Pierre Hintze. The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Granblue Fantasy was a JRPG mobile game only released in Japan, but that didn't stop enterprising westerners going to the effort to play it. That's mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin's Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
"We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated," Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It's currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

The company hasn't revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft's layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft's ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company's portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in "strategic, competitive areas" like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It's a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting advent…]]></summary>

While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn't account for every person that watched the series, but it's a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there's not much to go on here, so it's currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird's eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it's no surprise we're getting a trailer like this today. It's a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There's even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it's looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That's because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year's House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO's Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon's 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show's gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
"We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success," CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. "Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season." 
"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could," Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. "We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts." 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad's start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a "Battle Pass" one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too.

"You know how fuzzy memories can be." It's a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece's most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering "what if…?" scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…]]></summary>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…]]></summary>
