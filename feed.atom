        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus recently brought on Nier developer Yoko Taro (spotted by Automaton, who also drew attention to the key quote) to promote their upcoming Metaphor ReFantazio. While Yoko Taro is not generally associated with Atlus (or Sega), he was very enthusiastic about the new game, stating, “It’s so stylish, I almost wet myself.”


We’ve all been there; playing a game so captivating that our weakened bladders give out. Sometimes, not enough to breach the silk of our underpants, but other times so voluminous that a replacement couch must be brought in immediately (I assume most people keep a spare on hand for emergencies). In this case, it was the UI that Taro found so pant-soakingly amazing. Who doesn’t appreciate a good typeface? The first time I saw Microsoft Word’s Wordart, I nearly died of dehydration.




Taro stresses that he was neither incentivized nor under duress when he gave his opinion. He says he’s a fan of Atlas and later clarifies, “Oh, I didn’t get any money for this! I’m just a middle-aged dude who showed up,” he said. Much of the video posted on YouTube is just tomfoolery – the best type of foolery – alongside voice actress Tomomi Isomura. He spends a good amount of time talking about Nier. Admittedly, it gets pretty bizarre. Eventually, it’s just his mask on a box that he’s voicing over. Really on brand for Yoko Taro.


Metaphor Refantazio looks like a good time. I don’t think I’ll actually play it because it’s likely going to be a jillion hours long. I don’t have time for that these days. Unless the bosses here asked me to cover it and gave me, like, a week off to play it. Then I’d play it. And they should totally do that.


Metaphor Refantazio releases October 11, 2024 and will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

The highly anticipated next entry in the Legend of Zelda franchise, Echoes of Wisdom, dropped a new trailer today with an in-depth look at some major gameplay features. Most notably, it gave us a look at the Still World, Echoes of Wisdom's equivalent to the Dark World from previous titles, and Zelda's Swordfighter Form, which allows her to do combat with a sword and shield. 




The Still World is where Link and other inhabitants of Hyrule have been whisked away to, as the rifts open up around the kingdom. Inside, there will be floating islands (similar to those found in Tears of the Kingdom) that were taken from the land. Zelda can traverse these …]]></summary>

This operative from the Sandman Division puts foes to sleep with daggers and bullets alike. Her core kit revolves around positioning, movement, finding the right moment, and unloading a hailstorm of rounds. Here's our best build for Haze in Deadlock.


(Before we get started, a quick shoutout to Chrome, whose Haze build isn't just a fantastic primer on this hero, but one of the best early examples of quality in-game Deadlock guides. Their work was foundational for putting our own guide together, and they're worth following if you're looking for in-game options.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Ops Cold War's Body Shield returns in Black Ops 6, allowing you to give a nice hug to your opponents. The tactic offers many advantages by safely guarding you from enemy gunfire. We'll show you how to use Body Shield in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta.


How to perform Body Shield in Black Ops 6 beta


To use Body Shield in Black Ops 6 beta, sneak up behind an enemy and double-tap the Melee button. The interaction appears when you're close to the opponent, which will also display a prompt for a Finishing Move (holding the button instead). It'll be tricky to do with all the chaos going around, so it may take a few tries to master.


Screenshot by Destructoid


I find it best to perform the Body Shield while holding a Melee weapon, as it helps you move around faster. Some maps also have more hiding spots for you to use, including the train yard in Derelict. Then, once you complete it, you'll temporarily gain control of the opponent with the free range to move around. Look out for the meter at the center of the screen to determine how long the shield will last. It goes by quickly, and the "victim" can even call for help to cut it short. Just try to take advantage of the shield while you can and shoot down anyone in your way.


Screenshot by Destructoid


When the Body Shield victim has done their part, you'll have the option to Quick Kill or Execute (Finishing Move) them. But if you want to keep the fun going, you can use voice chat with them to whisper some sweet nothings in their ears.

Valfaris: Mecha Therion wastes no time in getting going. During the briefest of cutscenes we’re re-introduced to series main man Therion on a gothic-styled spaceship hurtling through the stars. Hekate, his AI companion, says she’s picked up the signal of his father, Vroll, the man responsible for the destruction of Therion’s home planet Valfaris, and someone Therion would very much like to kill. Therion turns and, with a strut, heads off to battle. We found it all delightfully brief.
While the previous game (the idiosyncratic Valfaris) was a hectic Contra-style run-and-gun experience, this sequel has morphed the series into a side-scrolling shooter – R-Type by way of Pacific Rim. The setting is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi hellscape where colour palettes have been maxed out to their highest saturation and contrast, and a pleasingly epic death metal soundtrack accompanies every moment.

The N64 analog stick is a trash barge. I’ve had it with those damned things. They’re designed in such a way that they degrade with use and eventually either go completely limp or irrevocably stiff, and I am certain there is a dick joke in there. Back in the ‘90s, if you visited a Blockbuster Video, there was a good chance you’d get to experience a limp stick, but there was also a good chance your home already had one. My family went through quite a few N64 controllers. They were the stick drift of their day.

Today's lesson is all about character balance and the need to stress their differences to make them equal. It's a concept that seems strange initially but, as Sakurai notes, "The more similar you make your fighter's abilities, the more they'll start to feel like the same character".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many early access periods, Black Ops 6 beta is reasonably limited in various specs. One, in particular, is the level cap, which won't be as substantial as the official version. So, if you want to know about its restrictions, here's the max level cap in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta. 


Black Ops 6 beta max level cap, explained


The max level cap for Black Ops 6 beta Weekend One is Level 20. You'll be able to reach this tier by completing Daily Challenges and earning enough XP from the various modes. In return, you'll unlock all the Custom Loadout features, at least for the first weekend.


Level 4 proves to be the most crucial rank out of all of them, considering that it unlocks the customizable loadouts. Fortunately, you'll obtain a few pre-made builds by Level 1 to get you through the early matches. Beta rewards will also be available, ending with the Squish Westpoint Operator Skin.

If you haven't pre-ordered Black Ops 6, you can tune into Weekend Two, which doesn't require a pre-order status. The max level cap raises to Level 30 at this point, bringing more rewards to your arsenal. Unlock gear such as the Combat Axe, Tac Mask Perk, and Chopper Gunner Scorestreak to get easy kills. The last tier earns you the Bug Smasher Weapon Blueprint, designed for the XM4 Assault Rifle.


Get ready for a much higher level cap once the Black Ops 6's beta period concludes. The updated Prestige systems will undoubtedly change up this feature, starting at the maximum Level 55. Although Prestige won't be available for the beta, you can use this time to hone your craft for the official launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once EA FC 25 goes live on early access, EA Play members will have certain benefits to enjoy.


For the layman, EA Play is Electronic Arts' version of the Xbox Game Pass: Pay a monthly fee to enjoy a vast library of video games. Unlike the Game Pass, however, EA doesn't typically add new releases to the base version of the subscription (though they also have a Pro version exclusively available to PC players). Naturally, there are more benefits available to the Pro subscribers, including access to the full game.


Can you play EA FC 25 with EA Play?


While the answer is yes, the accessibility with the base version is limited to a maximum duration of ten hours. Once again, EA Play members will get access to a free 10-hour trial. This is expected to be available on September 20 (September 21 in certain regions) once the early access goes live. You can try out all the modes for free for this period if you have a membership.


This benefit also automatically accrues to those with a Game Pass Ultimate membership (as EA Play is embedded within the service). If you own the Standard Edition and also have an EA Play membership, you can use the trial to get a head start.




Is EA FC 25 available on EA Play Pro subscription?


Yes, and you can also enjoy the full seven days of early access with your Pro subscription. You also get all the benefits of the Ultimate Edition (like FC Points, unique cards, and more). But you won't have to pay any upfront fee apart from the subscription cost.


The Pro subscription, as of writing, is only available for PC users and costs more at $14.99 a month (annual payment costs less). You also get to play other day-one releases with the Pro variant, as EA adds almost all its games immediately to the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing 2v2 online Madden 25 can be pretty chaotic and hilarious at times, but it's very easy to win games if you have great chemistry with your buddy.


There are several ways to play against your friend without having to share the same system. With crossplay, you and your friend can match up against each other, as long as the two of you are using the same generation of platforms. But you can also squad up with your friend to play as a team or two (or even three) across different game modes.


Madden 25 2v2 online guide


It's a lot easier to play 1v1 in Madden 25. When you want to play 2v2, you're restricted to either the Superstar mode or the Ultimate Team mode. I prefer the latter, but the process of playing with your buddy is the same irrespective of your selected mode.



Start the game and let Ultimate Team load up.


On the home screen, go to "Head 2 Head".


From this mode, choose "Squads Season".


This mode is exclusive to playing in a squad.


You can invite a solo friend to go 2v2, or ask one more to 3v3. All of you can choose different roles before matchmaking.

The process of playing in a squad with your buddy is slightly different in Superstar mode.



In the Superstar mode, there's an option called "Play a Friend".


In this section, you can invite up to two other friends, and the two/three of you can take on other similar squads.



Whether it's the Superstar mode or Ultimate Team mode, the co-op experience in Madden 25 is truly unique. Make sure that you've added your friends on EA so that you can invite them to your lobby.

One card, in particular, has been causing quite a stir within the community because some players don't understand how it works: Pete, Game Referee. 


The issue is with Pete, Game Referee's effect. The card's text states, "Blow the Whistle: When you play this character, opponents can't play actions until the start of your next turn." Players are discussing how the card works on Twitter because some believe it's unclear. While many players take the effect at face value, others can't decide if the effect must be announced when played or if it impacts how you play and move other cards.

Up to this point in the game, Yellow Wind Sage has arguably been the hardest boss in the game, but I think Captain Wise-Voice really gives the Sage a run for his money. The Captain is a tall, four-legged being that can deal a ton of damage in just a few hits and also has an extremely large health pool. To me, this battle felt like a war of attrition, but the best way to come out on top is to know your enemy before going in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

Once you've mastered the tutorial phase in Echocalypse, you'll gain access to Squad customization, a pivotal moment to assemble your team. It's the perfect time to place in B or C tiers, as they may be easier to get. However, you may be lucky enough to pull for the SS ranks, similar to the gacha system of Genshin Impact.

Ah, yeah. That’s the juice. That’s some good stuff right there. A few years ago, I did an article on a PS1 game called Courier Crisis. It was a very similar theme done in 1997, where you have to deliver packages as bombastically as possible. Except Courier Crisis isn’t very good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every season of Brawl Stars introduces new Hypercharges, and this time we’re seeing six new ones. Poco, Mortis, Squeak, Tara, Nani, and Surge are the Brawlers getting these upgrades in the Brawl Stars SpongeBob season. Here’s a quick look at what each Hypercharge brings.


All New Hypercharges in Brawl Stars SpongeBob Season




Poco


Poco’s Super heals himself and any allies caught in his musical wave. With the new Hypercharge, his Super not only heals but also adds a shield based on the extra healing, providing Poco and his team with additional protection.


Mortis


Mortis’ Super summons a swarm of bats that damage enemies and heal Mortis. The Hypercharge makes the Super return to its maximum range, delivering full damage and healing effects.


Squeak


Squeak’s Super releases a large pile of goo that explodes into six smaller bombs. With the Hypercharge, the goo can bounce and split an extra time, making Squeak’s attacks more versatile and harder to avoid.


Tara


Tara’s Super creates a black hole that pulls in enemies and then explodes for damage. The Hypercharge increases the size and duration of the black hole, giving Tara more control over her enemies.


Nani


Nani’s Super deploys a drone-like machine called "Peep," which can be guided with the joystick and will explode on contact. With the Hypercharge, Peep’s size and speed are both increased, making it a more effective weapon.


Surge


Surge’s Super upgrades his stats to level three during gameplay in Brawl Stars. The Hypercharge boosts him to level five stats, and his shots will now split regardless of whether they hit an enemy or travel a certain distance. Additionally, his range is also increased.

Sadly, the event has a maximum capacity of only 1,000 in person, but if you want to be involved and watch live, the event will be streamed live on the FFXIV Twitch channel. 


Of course with the event taking place in Australia, the time-zone difference will mean that you may have to watch at a strange time, depending on where you are in the world. The steam will be live at 1 a.m. PT / 4 a.m. ET / 9 a.m. BST on October 8.


For those who are lucky enough to attend in person, there will be a free commemorative poster available as a souvenir of the event, featuring an illustration of every class:

If you’ve ever wanted a sneak peek at what goes on behind-the-scenes in terms of the ongoing development of FFXIV, this discussion is well worth tuning into. Yoshida will be talking about everything from his creative process, to what he’s learned over his 30 year career in development, to the futures of MMORPGs as a whole. 


It will be interesting to see whether Yoshida comments on the discourse surrounding Dawntrail, and whether he provides any hints as to the future direction of FFXIV. The end of Dawntrail left the story open to so many possible paths of development, so I’m hoping to hear some tidbits of information about where the story may be headed, either from this discussion or during PAX West.

The ALGS (Apex Legends Global Series) is where teams from around the world battle it out to show they're the best and, hopefully, take home a decent chunk of the $1 million prize pool. Compositions are always reflective of what the best teams and players in the world are using, whether professionally or casually in ranked mode.

Out of the Seven Wonders of the World, we can add one more to the list in recent years, a triumph of human engineering achievement almost as jaw-dropping as the Great Pyramids of Giza or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon: Sid Meier's classic 4X Civilization series now operates fine and dandy on Nintendo Switch, with nary a keyboard or mouse to be found.
At Gamescom, we chatted with Civilization VII’s Creative Director Ed Beach about how they’ll get players hitting 'one more turn' through the course of human history until the early hours yet again.

Now, a Nintendo Life favourite is joining the roster of decompiled N64 games (thanks to CM30 for the tip!).
Thanks to Banjo Kazooie (a coder, not the game...), Banjo-Kazooie has now been fully decompiled, pushing the way for PC ports and mods galore. The news was shared on Twitter by Bring Back Banjo.

Nintendo has dropped a brand new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and we finally know a little bit more about those rifts that cover Hyrule.
The Still World is a brand new location that probably reminds you of the Dark World by its name alone, but it's a little bit more than that. In these rifts, Hyrule is literally torn apart, with people and objects floating in mid-air, frozen in time forever.

Gorgeous-looking storybook adventure The Plucky Squire will, rather brilliantly, be localised into 11 different languages with full voice acting. Developer All Possible Futures made this announcement on Twitter yesterday and shared the full localisation credits (again, brilliant), but it was what followed that made us smile the most because, as it turns out, the Brazilian dub stars none other than Shrek... kinda.
Mauro Ramos, the voice of Shrek in Brazil, will be lending his vocal talents to the role of Narrator in The Plucky Squire. Ramos has also performed dubbing work for the likes of Pumba in The Lion King and Sully in Monsters Inc., but it is clearly the lovable ogre that All Possible Futures' James Turner and co. are the proudest to boast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking free.
In many ways, Gundam Breaker 4 represents a fresh start for Bandai Namco’s mecha action series. Not only is this a return to the roots after the divisive New Gundam Breaker didn’t go over so well with the fanbase, but this marks the first time that the mainline series has come to either the Nintendo Switch or Western audiences. Luckily, Gundam Breaker 4 makes a great first impression—its combat is addictive, the customisation options are second to none, and there’s enough content here to keep you busy for quite a while. If you’ve been looking for a solid new hack ‘n’ slash action game to add to your Switch library, this just may be for you.
Gundam Breaker 4 features a simple story, placing you in the role of a self-insert protagonist who is playing an in-universe version of Gundam Breaker 4. You start out by making a few friends in your ‘online’ sessions who you soon form a clan with, then slowly start building your experience and prestige in the community as you overcome rivals and work up to participate in the big Battle Tournament at the end of the season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

Many of us were so blinded by the announcement that Pauline would be joining Super Mario Party Jamboree that we failed to look closer at the new website's contents. And yet, coming back to it with a clear head, it seems that a bunch of returning minigames were also teased.
The website highlights a boatload of the 110+ minigames that we can expect to find in Jamboree, the majority of which appear to be new, but there were a couple hidden in the roster that looked strangely familiar. 'Platform Peril' from Mario Party 1? 'Granite Getaway' and 'Snow Brawl' from Mario Party 6? Mario Party 4's 'Three Throw'?! All the following snaps are from the new website, so it looks like we have a couple of returning guests to look forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

As you can see in the photo below, he's got some fantastic taste - with gems like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on display, Rare's GoldenEye 007, and what appears to be the original Paper Mario game. We can also see Blast Corps and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Outside of the container you can also see games like Majora's Mask, Resident Evil 2 and Jet Force Gemini.

Konami has been making waves this year with its upcoming duo of high-budget remakes of Silent Hill 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. For Castlevania fans, however, it’s been a bit of a quiet one, with seemingly no sign of any new entry in the long-running gothic franchise.
Despite this, the publisher has been trickling out compilations of its older Castlevania games, starting with the Anniversary Collection in 2019 followed by the Advance Collection in 2021. Now, Castlevania Dominus Collection brings all three DS entries to the Switch in one handy package, meaning fans now have access to pretty much every Castlevania game worth playing on one system. Right..? Right? Sigh… C’mon, Konami, just give us Symphony of the Night, for goodness' sake.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

Po čtyřech dnech výslechů ho propustila z vazby, ale Durov bude pod policejním dohledem a nesmí opustit zemi. Ve středu to podle agentury AFP uvedla pařížská prokuratura.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.

Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then I reflect on the statistically determined average age of a Gamer – what is it now, 36, 37? Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Sites with over a billion annual visits tend not to throw everything away so easily. Yet last night, a site with close to two billion visits disappeared in similar circumstances, rapidly followed by another, and then many others after that. In the absence of an official announcement, earlier today we took an early sift through the wreckage.

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a "bank holiday" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.

With just four months left of 2024, a software supplier hasn't even been chosen yet. With the current system falling over, previously blocked domains and IP addresses are being unblocked to make room for new ones, something that the law has no provision for. Meanwhile, smart TV manufacturers will soon be asked to ban a VPN app from their sets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular pirate streaming site Fmovies shut down this summer, with several sister sites following suit. These sites were redirected to new streaming portals, purportedly operated by different individuals. This caught the attention of anti-piracy group ACE, which obtained a DMCA subpoena this week to unmask the people behind these new sites.

I don't usually get to do these weekend features, but Ollie and James are busy working their magic (stripmining Black Myth: Wukong for guides and fleeing Gamescom), while Nic can't type complete words anymore without getting his hands eaten (see latest domestic update, below). I know that Ollie usually does a picture puzzle for you, but I am comparatively innocent in the ways of Photoshop and more importantly, very lazy - so lazy that I can't think of an elegant way to complete this paragraph, and will proceed immediately to stating: here's what we're all playing this weekend.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.

So much so that I mentioned in my review how I’m well up for another run of its fifteen hour campaign. I’d already got a few missions into hard mode. There's no more starting mana points! It’s a real...pane.
Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been necromantically dreaming of a Callisto Protocol sequel, I'm afraid the monkey paw finger hasn't just curled - it's jammed itself right up your nose and scratched an FU on your hypothalamus. Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps deeply ungrateful of me that, when presented with the squirrel with a gun of Squirrel With A Gun, my immediate reaction is to thrust out my bowl like a ballsy victorian urchin and ask for additional squirrel information. It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've yet to discover a SteamWorld game I don't like. Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lo, a ripple in the release date sands. Stand still a moment while we study this phenomenon. Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

That's lovely. Thanks videogames.  And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then FPS sequel Borderlands 4 surely loves us the most.
Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at this year's Geoffcom, RoadCraft is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As much as I’m a sucker for the grimmest and darkest of grimdark fantasy settings, the try-hardness of it all can get a bit grating at times. You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed.

You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.
