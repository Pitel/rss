Breachway combines roguelike elements with deckbuilding to create a run-based space exploration game presenting new challenges in every star system. The basic hook has you exploring a large region of space while searching for new ship components and thus adding cards to the deck you’ll use in combat. Additionally, you'll pick up new crew members along the way, each with unique abilities. Multiple factions exist in the game, and they all control their own pockets of space.

A game could be disappointing. It could be technically deficient for its era or mechanically lacking compared to others in its genre. For my money, the worst kind of kusoge is the boring kind. A broken game is at least fun to analyze, but an uninteresting game is just exhausting. As excruciating as it is, I would rather play Hoshi wo Miru Hito than, say, Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum.

With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the "where" and "when": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern
Please join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.

February 12, 2024
The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.
The other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week later, Xbox is ready to share its new business plans with everyone this Wednesday, February 15. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer, President of Xbox Sarah Bond, and Head of Xbox Gaming Matt Booty are coming together on the official Xbox Podcast at 3 p.m. EST on February 15 to share updates on the Xbox business.




 Does anyone else think it's weird this information is coming in podcast format?


No further details were provided, but you have to imagine the focus will be on reports and rumors that Xbox is planning to bring some of its exclusive titles to PlayStation. The rumors have shown just how divisive gamers can be, with some praising the end of the "console wars" with the hope of games being available on all platforms, while doomsayers claim this is the end of Xbox.


Me? I think the truth is probably somewhere in between. I highly doubt we'll see every Xbox IP come to PlayStation. I wouldn't expect haptic feedback when firing a Needler from Halo on PS5 or anything like that. But at the end of the day Xbox, and Microsoft, are all about that money. For games like Starfield, choosing to be Xbox exclusive essentially means leaving money on the table, especially when over 50 million PS5 units have been sold.


I guess we'll know for sure when Xbox shares its plans on February 15 at 3 p.m. EST. It will be streamed on YouTube and available via Podcast platforms.

The Satellaview was a digital satellite delivery (or broadcast) add-on for the Super Famicom. Like many prototypical digital distribution platforms, data retrieved from the service was only stored temporarily and could be overwritten whenever you downloaded something else. As such, if someone wanted to preserve a game, they had to dump it immediately before overwriting it, and obviously, few people did.


Against all odds, some games from the service were preserved, including the first BS F-Zero Grand Prix, which was composed of four separate broadcasts. This included five original tra…]]></summary>

Indeed, there's a small, but extremely dedicated community of Forza players that's spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours meticulously recreating real-world car paint swatches for virtual use. It's widely accepted that Gran Turismo generally offers a more pleasing and accurate car paint shader, and the fact of the matter is that some of the default manufacturer paints simply don't match up to their real-world inspiration. These issues have been around since Forza Horizon 4, at least…]]></summary>

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Ethan looks back on a pair of Wii U games — and a 3DS sibling — which could help curious gamers navigate the Switch Online retro library if they were given a second chance to shine...

With each passing year, the well of Nintendo franchises that haven’t yet graced the Switch runs ever drier — and I couldn’t be happier. Now that juggernauts like Animal Crossing have had their time in the sun, the later years of the hybrid console’s life have made space for the return of all sorts of niche legacy IP, from Another Code to Famicom Detective Club. But while the Switch has proven to be an oasis for the lesser-known properties in Nintendo’s stable, there’s one particular unsung micro-franchise stuck on last-generation hardware that arguably has the most potential for a revival.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced "gaslamp fantasy" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Action-RPG Sword of the Necromancer has a sequel on the way that takes it from top-down 2D to a fully 3D perspective. Ahead of that, the devs at Grimorio of Games plan to sample the new style with a 3D remake of the original sometime in 2024.


While there's no concrete date in place yet, Sword of the Necromancer: Resurrection is in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Gematsu). This one uses the engine of the sequel — which is titled Sword of the Necromancer: Revenant — to reimagine the 2021 outing and introduce new mechanics and systems. 


Here's a quick comparison between the original version (top) and the 3D remake (bottom):

We have just learnt of the sad news that Mojo Nixon, the musician, actor and radio DJ, has passed away at the age of 66.
Nintendo fans may recognise Nixon as the live-action face of Toad in 1993's Super Mario Bros. movie. This portrayal was more of an all-singing, government-defying, human-looking take on the iconic Mushroom Kingdom inhabitant than we are used to seeing, but one that was memorable nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I first saw Never Grave: The Witch And The Curse rising up the Steam Next Fest charts at the end of last week, I thought, "Oh! That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go." And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Banishers took a while to kick in," I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, "but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night." It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don't Nod's ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for "grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.
Banishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace "treasure" with "ghosts".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Rare Originals has announced that they’re bringing Bynine Studio’s Cavern of Dreams to Switch on February 29, 2024.


Cavern of Dreams was released on PC late last year on October 19, 2023. I played the demo but didn’t have time to take on the full release. It’s based on that very distinct N64 flavor of collectathon platformer that immediately turned on itself and died from self-deprecation. To sell the illusion, it also cops a low poly art style with blurry textures and odd lighting choices similar to the N64’s best.


I loved the demo that I played. You’re put in the role of a diminutive dragon who sets out across a variety of worlds to rescue his siblings, who are still within eggs. Where I’ve been disappointed by some other games in the indie sphere’s revival of the 3D platformer, Cavern of Dreams feels like a close facsimile of what made the genre charming.




Alongside the announcement of the Switch version, Super Rare Originals released an accolades trailer, so you can see brief, out-of-context quotes by others in the gaming press.


Unfortunately, I don’t see any mention of whether or not it will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch Online N64 controller.


Cavern of Dreams is currently available on PC. It will be released on Switch February 29, 2024.

Cavern of Dreams takes the classic, lo-fi visuals of N64 platformers to provide a new yet familiar take on the genre in which you star as Flynn, a cute dragon on a quest to rescue his unhatched buddies (yeah, that'll sound pretty familiar to fans of Spyro).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. "Procgen" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a "hand-made" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. 


One is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of "Fae" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principle quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[D3Publisher and Sandlot have announced that bug-basher Earth Defense Force 6 is being pushed back from its intended release window of Spring 2024 and into Summer 2024.


D3 suggests that the delay is so Sandlot can “add finishing touches and finalize preparations for its Western launch.” That’s basically all I got in terms of new information. I deliver nothing but disappointment.




The Earth Defense Force series started back on the PS2 with Simple 2000 Series Vol. 31: The Chikyū Bōeigun, which was released in Europe as Monster Attack. We didn’t receive the series here in North America until 2006 with Earth Defense Force 2017 on Xbox 360. It was released as a budget game and quickly developed a reputation of being so bad that it’s good. Indeed, a friend and I played it during the early days of the 360, and we loved it despite its immediately apparent jank. I still like to tell the story of how the light bloom from one of the guns would bleed over the split-screen barrier and make it impossible for the other player to see.


The series continued from there, with Sandlot embracing the game’s kusoge aesthetic while also making it a bit more fun and comfortable to play. I wish I was playing Earth Defense Force 5 right now.


Earth Defense Force 6 sees the dregs of humanity protecting their shattered civilization from continued attacks from “invasive” alien species. Thankfully, the eponymous EDF has 1-4 competent soldiers to protect it.


Earth Defense Force 6 will be coming West sometime in Summer 2024. It’s set to release on PS4, PS5, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's play a game. Let's see how long I can talk about No Man's Sky without bringing up its redemptive arc (this doesn't count, by the way). 


The universe-exploration game with the chill soundtrack has certainly found its home among sci-fi enthusiasts, and the developer's co-founder is, once again, up to his old tricks. Sean Murray recently tweeted something that has No Man's Sky fans pretty hyped up. What is it? Oh, it's just an Omega symbol he posted on Twitter/X. Why is that a big deal? Because Murray always tweets a singular tease like this whenever a big update is due to drop.




In fact, he's posted it more than once, including three consecutive Omega symbols in one tweet. This is not a drill, people!


"So what is it?" - obscure Red Dwarf reference


This is absolutely typical of Murray. As usual, these teases leave no clue (apart from the tease itself) as to what's coming. It's become part of the No Man's Sky marketing model and, honestly, looking at the comments and the recent posts on Reddit, it absolutely works.


Speculations have been inbound since the emoji post, with one person suggesting that it's some sort of fabled Horseshoe Update. We can't rule it out, though I think even Hello Games might draw the line there.


Released in 2016, No Man's Sky has been something of a unique entry in modern gaming. Encapsulating a galactic playground boasting more than 18 quintillion planets to discover, its initial and disastrous launch has become a distant memory. Vast (and free) updates have exceeded expectations, bringing us a game that's gone down as one of the best examples of a redemptive arc ever.


(Damn it!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would appear that the studio behind Helldivers 2, Arrowhead, didn't quite anticipate the massive surge in popularity the game received following its February 8 release date. With an all-time Steam peak of over 155,000 concurrent players, Helldivers 2's servers simply couldn't keep up with the attention.


On top of the usual suite of errors Helldivers 2 throws out when there's something amiss, something even worse cropped up last Sunday, February 11. Notably, Helldivers 2's servers straight-up died, and it didn't take long for Arrowhead Studios to respond. On the game's official Discord server, Arrowhead explained that there were too many players trying to join the galactic combat efforts at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems as though, since releasing at the tail end of last week, Helldivers 2 has become the new flavor of the month (Palworld, who?). Evidently, Arrowhead Studios' new third-person shooter must be doing something right, judging by where it is on the Steam charts.


A quick look at the Top Sellers list shows that Helldivers 2 is currently at the number one spot. This might not be much of a surprise, considering it's new and popular. However, the fact that it's knocked the Steam Deck off the spot is pretty interesting.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


The Deck itself typically remains steadfast, dominating the chart and keeping even the most hyped-up releases at bay. Of course, who knows how long it will stay there.


It's a slippery slope


We've seen this in the past, as well. Palworld also took over the Steam Deck's position as the head honcho of PC gaming, but struggled to keep the top spot. Given this, it probably won't be long before Valve's mobile gaming device reclaims its place.


That said, it says much about Helldivers 2's quick rise to fame and how well it's been performing over the weekend. It has a Steam review score of "Mostly Positive," which is pretty good, though some issues with crashing are probably holding it back slightly.


At the time of writing, the game has over 101,000 concurrent players, according to the most recent data from SteamDB. It also achieved a peak of 155,926 players recently. While this pales in comparison to Palworld (sorry to keep pitting the two against each other!), Arrowhead's new release can at least enjoy the ride while it lasts.

The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this "skunkworks" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, Doom. Is there any method by which you can't be ported? Evidently not, it seems. The latest in a near-endless attempt to get id Software's iconic FPS up and running on just about everything on the planet is one that will be music to your ears. Or not, as is the case.


Over on Reddit, user wojtek-graj has made Doom completely playable...in audio. That is to say, they've managed to get it to run in a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of sound frequencies. Actually, I'll let them give you the lowdown:



The game is displayed by generating an audio signal that can be viewed as a spectrogram, while input is taken from the microphone, with specific frequencies being mapped to specific keys.






They've also made the source code available on GitHub, as well as instructions on how to play it. So if you find playing the classic way a bit too passé, this is at least one alternative.


It will never end


There simply isn't time in the known universe to go through all the different devices that can now run a 30-year-old shooter. Suffice it to say, it's brought out a lot of creativity in people over the years. Here, someone has been wanting to get Doom to run on E. coli cells.


With the reboot coming out in 2016 and Eternal launching in 2020, the legendary id series has truly made a comeback. 


Not that it ever really went anywhere. Sure, things looked a little uncertain with Doom 3's approach to more survival horror, but seeing the OG running on a spectrogram means – if nothing else – fans sure aren't bored with Doom yet.

The Ys series has grown in popularity as the years have gone by, thanks in no small part to the later games' global releases, though the first title has always been something of an elusive beast. The OG nabbed itself an English-language Master System port and a TG-16 remake back in the day, but the upcoming EGGCONSOLE edition takes it back to where it all started on the PC-8801.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A linguistic odyssey.
Do you remember the mysterious swirly language dotted around Super Mario Sunshine's Isle Delfino? Probably not, and that's okay — this is a 20-year-old game, after all. But that hasn't stopped one YouTuber from the channel 2CPhoenix from digging in a little further. Yes, if you hadn't guessed by now, the language has been translated.
This was no easy feat. The 'Dolphic' language (as dubbed by 2CPhoenix) is pretty hard to come by across Isle Delfino. It can only be found in three Sunshine levels where it is often blown up to the point of illegibility, or obscured by some other object. In short, you're not going to pick it up just by being immersed in the island's culture.

Sega has released its financial results for Q3 of FY2024, and it paints a somewhat disappointing picture for the company as it reports 'sluggish' sales of premium titles, including Sonic Superstars (thanks, IGN).
In its Notice of Revision of Operating Results Forecast letter, the company states "In the Consumer area, although we released some new titles in Q3, including Sonic Superstars, Endless Dungeon, and Total War: Pharaoh, sales went sluggish during the holiday sales season."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evergreen.
The UK Charts look somewhat familiar this week, as both Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 24 return to positions one and two respectively. This means that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has now slipped down to take the bronze in what will no doubt be a blow to Warner Bros. Games after just a couple of weeks on the market.
Mario, however, has clearly borrowed Link's 'Iron Boots' this week, as both Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe remain fixed in place at number four and five respectively. Good going, sir. Over on the PS5, Helldivers II makes its debut at number seven; hardly the result Sony would have liked, but still, it's there (and overall sales have indicated a successful launch for the game).

This week brings at least one major news event in the shape of a "business update" from Microsoft about "our vision for the future of Xbox", which is widely rumoured to be the announcement that first-party Xbox titles will come to rival consoles. Why is this of interest to us, a PC gaming site? Well, because console gaming can't help but shape the weather for PC gaming; more specifically, Microsoft's alleged multiplatform ambitions seem to reflect the plateauing of Game Pass subscription growth, which has become the cornerstone of the Xbox biz.

Not only is it one of the most visually vibrant games of the year so far with its neon colour palette that's an instant-KO-to-my-eyeballs, but the way it twists and rewires core tenets of the Metroidvania rulebook also make it one of the boldest and most daring examples of its genre. I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.

"I myself am very surprised," said Shimomura on Twitter (through a translation provided by the platform). "I'm very honored." She also mentioned this is "possible thanks to [our] support."

Who is Kingdom Hearts composer Yoko Shimomura?


Yoko Shimomura is a game composer known for her decades of work in the industry. She's behind the scores of Street Fighter 2, the Kingdom Hearts series, Super Mario RPG (with a re-orchestrated soundtrack for the remake), Final Fantasy XV, and the Parasite Eve franchise. Her vivid and illustrious music has now been recognized by her peers in the industry.


"Dearly Beloved," the main menu theme from Kingdom Hearts, is arguably her most notable song. What impresses many is that each game has its own take on the original piano-led track. For example, there's a swing version of the track in the rhythm game Melody of Memory. 




“I was playing the beginning of the game, set in the Destiny Islands, and I was struck by a lot of imagery about the sea," said Yoko Shimomura to Square Enix. "Dearly Beloved just came to my mind one day, while I was thinking about that - picturing the sea and the waves.”


Streamed through IGN, the D.I.C.E. Awards will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Greg Miller and IGN's Stella Chung. The finalists for Game of the Year include Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cocoon, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blíží se další pravidelné setkání bastlířů, techniků a ajťáků - Virtuální Bastlírna. Na jaké novinky a témata k diskuzi se můžete těšit tentokrát? Do světa HW přinesla firma JLCPCB levnou výrobu plně barevných plošných spojů (takže vám už nic nebude bránit natisknout na všechny plošňáky svou podobiznu). Na trhu se už také běžně pohybují analogová FPGA, o kterých na Virtuální Bastlírně padla zmínka už před rokem. Zároveň na Printables.com probíhala soutěž v tvorbě roztodivných přípravků na pájení, na jejíž výsledky kluci na Virtuální Bastlírně upozorní. A pokud by náhodou padla nostalgická nálada, mohou ukázat jak se dělá overclocking počítače Ondra a nebo jak vypadal asi nejschopnější československý počítač okopírovaný ze západu.
 
Ve virtuální světě software pak strahováci poví jenom něco málo o smutném vývoji PlatformIO, ukáží jak se dá zaútočit na digitální momentové klíče Bosch (a lze tak vyřadit z provozu třeba celou fabriku) a nebo jak KiCAD dohání svého průmyslového souputníka Altium (spoiler alert - přidali splashscreen).

Pokud se zdá, že tento měsíc nejsou témata příliš lákavá, nebojte - kluci zmíní určitě i oblíbenou rubriku "Bizár". Například proč smart jistič ovládaný přes wifi není příliš dobrý nápad nebo jak se v Brně zapojuje plynové potrubí. A kdyby to nestačilo, v zásobě je i emulátor procesoru v Excelu.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 12. února od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

However, there can only be one winner and the spooky North American cover took it with 56% of the vote compared to Japan's 44%.

American football — or just football depending on where you are in the world. For some, it's a way of life. For others, it's another sport. But the thrill of watching teams duke it out over control of the ball is simply unmatched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've played Call of Duty Warzone since its release, you've seen plenty of oddities, from glitches to overpowered weapons. One that seems to keep coming back, though, is players' ability to survive for extended periods in the gas. 


Players could survive in the gas endlessly in the past using a Stim tactical item. The same bug has returned, with different steps to make it work, what seems like every six months since Warzone came out. For the start of season two, a Warzone perk added in season one, combined with an old one, makes it nearly impossible to die in the gas. Don't worry, the developers have a solution.


How are Warzone players surviving so long in the gas?




With most new Warzone updates, players are familiar with interesting new problems. At the start of season one, a ne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have looked at any website for the past month or so, you have heard about Palworld. It is avoidable. Inescapable. Inevitable. 


Everyone knew Palworld was going to be a big deal after its earliest announcement trailers, but nobody was prepared for just how huge it would be when it was released on January 19. 


Perhaps most surprised by its success was developer Pocket Pair, who are now pleading with interested parties to come work on the game. 


PocketPair puts out a plea for Palworld developer applications


In a message on the official Palworld Twitter/X page, PocketPair shared a message seemingly from the point of view of a lonely pal.


"There are still many things I want to do in Palworld, but we are severely lacking in friends!!!" the message  (which we machine translated) begins. 




"We are recruiting for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning/engineering positions!" the message continues. "It doesn't matter what engine you have experience with, so if you are interested in creating a completely new game, please apply!!"


There are not a lot of specifics available about just how big (or small) Pocket Pair is. However, we know from a post on Pocket Pair CEO Takuro Mizobe's Note page that it was as small as a 10-person team at one point, where he referred to the game's release as "Miracle 4."


"Palworld was originally intended to be completed in one year." Mizobe wrote in the January 16th blog. "I have no desire to create a major title in the first place. I don't have any desire to make the same thing over and over again. And no matter how you look at it, the company Pocketpair is not suited to making large titles. Actually, there were only 10 people at the time, so I didn't have that image at all."


Palworld is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.

Not much is known about the upcoming Physint at this point. Kojima refers to it in the State of Play as the culmination of his 40-year gaming career. Obviously, longtime fans of Metal Gear Solid are eager to learn more. 


Kojima has now offered further details on the upcoming game, including the mystery illness that motivated him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to listen to the music of The Legend of Zelda live? Well, consider your wish granted. Nintendo has dropped the VOD for The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert onto their YouTube after canceling the originally Tokyo-exclusive performance at Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO.




Some of the tracks performed include Kakariko Village, The Ballad of the Goddess, and the main theme of Tears of the Kingdom. The orchestra beautifully showcases the series' rich musical history through powerful renditions of the beloved classics. At a runtime of almost a half hour, it'll make for a pretty nice trip down memory lane if you're up for that adventure. 


Also posted were statues of the Tears of the Kingdom's versions of Zelda, Link, and our no.1 hottie (according to Zoey Handley), Ganondorf. 




The concert was originally planned for Nintendo Live TOKYO in January. Nintendo canceled the event after receiving threats targeting the audience and workers. 


In addition to the Zelda concert, Nintendo also held a Splatoon 3-themed concert the morning of February 10. 


Musically Inclined


Whether you like The Legend of Zelda or not, you have to agree the music is amazing. Whether it's the classic Koji Kondo tracks or the newer Manaka Kataoka compositions, all Zelda music is downright memorable. So, to be able to have a whole concert dedicated to it and done live is pretty awesome. 


Watching the concert made me realize something: I really want to see it live. The closest I got to that was Lindsey Stirling with her Zelda melody years ago. And, as someone who's watched the trailers for Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wind multiple times for the songs, I'd pay good money. I feel the same way about Final Fantasy and Sonic, as all of them have amazing orchestral tracks that'd be amazing to see live. So, Nintendo, maybe you could plan a national tour or something? Fine, I'll just play my ocarina in private.

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

It quickly turned to sleet in many places and was carried by monstrous gusts in others. I likely would have ended up sodden and sullen halfway up a hill. But what if...!

That widespread appeal has translated to sales, as nearly every Mario Kart game ranks near the top of its platform's sales chart. But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you're spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. 
Sure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it's never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing up, I played a lot of puzzle games, but I didn’t have much love for them. This is because my mother loves puzzle games, and I probably didn’t like them much because it was one of the genres she could beat me at.


However, the experiences I had playing Yoshi’s Cookie and Kirby’s Avalanche with her have left me with some nostalgia for the titles. I don’t actually play them much, but they feel good to my soul, at least.


One game I used to play with her is different, however. It’s a puzzle game that I’m actually enthusiastic about and dust off every so often. It's one that I can enjoy without the sentimental attachment, even if some sentiment is still there. That is 1997’s Tetrisphere for the N64.

Abathor comes from developer Pow Pixel Games, and upon firing the demo up I was whisked away to a world full of bold box art, Fabio's hair blowing in the breeze. The demo conjures thoughts of games like Rastan, Magic Sword, or even Turbografx-16 adventure Legendary Axe.

For some formulas, there’s plenty of room in the market for pretenders. Consumer hunger may wane over time, but genres like open-world, survival, RPG, or fighting have always had an audience. However, this doesn’t hold true with Games as a Service, whether it’s subscriptions or microtransactions. Publishers rushed into the MMO market following the explosive success of World of Warcraft, and now we have a trail of very expensive corpses littering the past two decades.

        <updated>2024-02-09T20:59:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the recently listed Steam store page, Digital Dreams Entertainment’s Mutant Football League 2 will launch into Early Access in March 2024.


Released in 2017, Mutant Football League serves as the spiritual revival of the 1993 Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game, Mutant League Football. But beyond just slyly changing around the word order to avoid retribution from EA, MFL is helmed by the creator of the original 16-bit titles, Michael Mendheim.


Mutant Football League 2 is the sequel to the only football game that I actually enjoy and continue to play. Other reception I’ve seen has been lukewarm, but I’m serious. I’ve tried multiple times to get into other football titles like NFL Blitz, but I felt doomed to forever hate the sport. I mean American football, not real football. I suppose the secret sauce to get me interested is to just somehow make it more violent.


Mutant Football League has you choose a team made up of skeletons, werewolves, and robots and kick the pigskin or something. Beyond just being American football with furries, cheating is encouraged, and violence is an inevitability. The inclusion of dirty tricks just adds an extra layer of fun strategy. Murder is a legitimate strategy, allowing you to focus on eliminating your opponent's best players.


The Early Access release will start with just 12 teams and arenas out of the planned 48. It will be offline only at first, and the team is giving the heads up that it will initially be reusing the audio assets from the first game but will be updated with its own music and VO over time. They’re hoping that the full version will be ready in Fall 2024.


The team has had some difficulty in developing Mutant Football League 2, as many of the developer’s staff are located in Ukraine, which is currently under invasion by Russia.


Mutant Football League 2 is set to release on Steam Early Access on PC in March

The gifting is set to go on until the launch of The Final Shape expansion in June. And at 700 Bright Dust per weekly reset, it's certainly no small amount to gloss over.


Bright Dust is one of the premium currencies found within Destiny 2. While players can earn it in-game through various means, it's usually nothing too substantial. Bright Dust is used alongside Silver for purchases through the Eververse Store. It's primarily a shop for cosmetic items like shaders, weapon ornaments, vehicles, or exclusive armor appearances. Though much of the Eververse Store demands Silver, every week, various goodies are sold for Bright Dust instead.


Bungie dropped this unexpected and generous news in Destiny 2's latest This Week In Destiny communication. In a short section titled "The Future Is Bright," Bungie explained, "As we head toward The Final Shape, we're honoring Guardians with a new weekly gift of Bright Dust. Starting on March 5, players can visit the Eververse store to claim 700 Bright Dust each week leading up to the launch of The Final Shape. Make sure to log in, get your Dust, and spend wisely, Guardians."


Bright Dust transactions have historically been absent for some of the hottest Destiny 2 cosmetics, like the Witcher crossover armor. That said, plenty of spend-worthy choices are available each week, especially if players have missed past seasons or holiday events. With (by my count) 9100 extra Bright Dust, do yourself a favor and treat yourself.

While the series has some entries that are stronger than others, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortable with.
In 2018, we ranked the top 300 games of all time in our 300th issue. While that list was more about ranking games in terms of quality, importance to the industry, and cultural relevance, this list is just about our favorite games. So check out our rankings of the 22 core Super Mario games below!

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. 
But one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is "probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that." Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.
Some games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of "living, breathing" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, "gardenvania" - which launches next week.

My eyes are still reeling from the gloss and glitz and pulsating lights of the Steam Next Fest demo, and I welcome this pain. Grab the demo now and set out to explore a space station as a bopping security bot with snazzy boots and endless projectile lipstick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been some concern among the Subnautica fan base that the next entry will be going for a more "Games-as-a-Service" model. It's a trend that's often met with negative response, but it turns out this is probably not the case for the upcoming game.


According to a recent update on Unknown World's website – the developer behind the Subnautica series – there are no plans to implement GaaS for the next installment. This is almost certainly a response to what publisher Krafton said in a recent earnings call.




Interestingly, while writing the original draft of this story, it looks like Krafton may have changed what it originally said. The screenshot of the financial report in question from PC Gamer shows "Games-as-a-Service" being touted as a selling point for Subnautica 2. However, in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a dismal time to be in video game development, as companies continue to announce layoffs. Now, Take-Two Interactive – the parent company of Rockstar – is looking to enact a "significant cost reduction plan," but it doesn't necessarily mean redundancies.


That's according to CEO and chairman Strauss Zelnick, who told IGN recently that there are "no current plans" to lay staff off. The specifics of this plan are said to still being worked out, but Zelnick says there are other areas that need looking at, such as marketing, third-party expenses, supply services, etc.




He also adds that the "hardest thing to do is to lay off colleagues," though that phrasing sort of suggests one would do it if it was easier. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.


I'm a cynic, what can I say?


It's difficult to talk about Take-Two without mentioning GTA 6. Last year's reveal trailer has been viewed a squillion times, making it one of the most-viewed video game teasers in existence. If the parent company does eventually decide it needs to initiate layoffs, there's no telling whether this would potentially affect the next Grand Theft Auto game.


Again, this is just a complete guess from me. While there aren't any "current" plans for layoffs, that doesn't necessarily mean things won't change in the future, near or far.


Just recently, Take-Two was also in the headlines, facing a class-action lawsuit regarding microtransactions in NBA games. Hard to find two topics that get people more riled up than layoffs and microtransactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios is teasing some of the enhancements coming to GOTY Baldur's Gate 3 upcoming Patch 6. According to Larian, improvements have been made to smooching in the cRPG, as can be seen in the brief video clip they provided. In this teaser, Halsin follows up a passionate kiss with a peck on the forehead, which does not exist in the current build.




Further enhancements include new camp idle animations, new Legendary Actions in Honour Mode, and a trove of bug fixes. Larian states Patch 6 is a hefty one, so it will be providing full patch notes on the BG3 website at a later date.


No release timeframe was given for the update, but with Valentine's Day right around the corner, I'd have to imagine a kissing-centric patch may try to coincide with that timeframe.


Patch 6 marks the sixth big addition to Baldur's Gate 3 that Larian has developed since the cRPG released in August. Each one has added something new while also implementing a ton of bug fixes between the patch and hotfix releases. On our end, we've been tracking Larian's patch cadence with a BG3 update history and schedule. 


I don't know about you but it may be time to finally start that next BG3 playthrough. I've been wanting to try a Dark Urge run, but I'm not too sure that fits the theme of the romantic improvements. Or does it?

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

The answer is apparently "be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.
You know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects
you.

That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of Baldur's Gate 3 is a double-edged sword for other CRPGs launching in its wake. On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own "repercussions", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from "literally about 3 ever made" to "does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense "survive the ordeal" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.
But it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In survival games, I leave the building to everyone else, or I build the absolute bare minimum unless I really enjoy the world I'm in. I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.
But I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, "water" and "fire" combine to make "steam", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable. More games should facilitate haphazard engineering and silliness.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

Toufexis also shared a few parting speculations about the unannounced Deus Ex sequel from Eidos Montreal that was reported cancelled last week. Toufexis wasn't involved with this one, and according to him, it likely wasn't a continuation of Jensen's story from Mankind Divided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

Inkulinati, a turn-based strategy game where you play a medieval artist duking it out with another artist on the pages of an illuminated manuscript, is one such. It's been kicking about on Steam since at least 2019, and in fairness to me it did launch in January last year - it just went into early access. These factors contributed to me being sort of surprised at the reveal of the actual release date for 1.0, which is February 22nd.

The associated joint statement from developers Blackbird Interactive and publishers Gearbox arrived within hours of me posting about said Homeworld 3 demo and saying that while I am fully onboard with many aspects of the new space strategy game, I do have reservations about its controls. 


Naturally, and self-flatteringly, I'm now petrified that I'm single-handedly responsible for the delay. Please come back, Homeworld 3! I didn't mean it! I'm pretty sure I'll acclimatise to the control scheme with practice! True-3D starfleet management is always a bit fiddly! Besides which, I might not get to review it now!! I'm moving flat in May!!!

The Legion Go debuted at £699, a price at which we found it largely compelling, but now it's dropped to something a bit more reasonable - £649. 
That £50 discount doesn't make it a budget option by any means, especially with the most affordable Steam Deck at £349 and an OLED model at £479, but it's still a welcome price drop on one of the most intriguing PC handhelds we've seen yet.

I've played many variations of this mode - which was originally a mod, Gun Game - over the years in other games, and it's always a laugh, for the simple reason that it can be tuned to allow less proficient FPS players to catch up with their brethren, by introducing less powerful or harder-to-master weapons at certain levels as "speed bumps".

I love their legally distinct take on many of the biggest brands, like the "Racer", which is basically a Snickers bar. Except I actually prefer the Racer! I can't remember if it's Aldi or Lidl that do them, but the "Mini Delight" chocolate sticks are also exceptional. Anyway, Armored Core. Or should I say, Exterminator? Yes, there's an Aldi Armored Core that's just opened up in town and it's actually not half bad. It's definitely not Racer good, but I applaud the effort.

The Condiment King was created for the 90s animated series as a play on those kinds of whimisical, pun-focused villains. He shoots sauce and says things like "You just don't cut the mustard, Batman!". Maybe when you have to put out at least one issue a month, you throw a lot of villain spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and once something does you then go about making "guy who has a thing for the calendar" more of a rounded character - a sinister dude with a weird backstory. Or you make him the world's greatest wife guy.

There's a whole Gwent-like card game called Queen's Blood (watch out Triple Triad), dolphin ride obstacle courses, playing with Mooglets, the return of Intergrade's Fort Condor battles, a strange bit of chicken wrangling, photographing Red XIII, frog jumping... and that's before we even get to all the stuff at Gold Saucer. Honestly, Like A Dragon better watch out, as Rebirth is clearly making a play for its mini-game crown in this second part of Squeenix's Final Fantasy 7 Remake project, and man alive, I'm so very here for it.

The game continues to impress with each passing look, earning its spot as the "Most Anticipated Game" at The Game Awards 2023.
The world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is broken into various regions, which seamlessly blend into one another. After the intro sequence, players enter into the Grasslands, a grassy area south of Midgar. From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra's military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides. The game also includes Corel, which features the touristy beach town of Costa del Sol, the massive playground known as Gold Saucer, and the dusty portion of the region to…]]></summary>

It's no secret that I've spent a lot of time playing, seeing, talking about, and writing about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix's Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue's cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table. However, after coming out of the hours-long gameplay session and another conversation with director Naoki Hamag…]]></summary>

During today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven't yet witnessed and characters we've seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth's quest for the Black Materia and the party's efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it's all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Singapore's piracy sim Skull And Bones started development in 2013, and during the subsequent decade-and-change it has seemingly collided with every possible reef in the ocean of videogame production, undergoing a series of delays, reboots and staff departures. Perhaps it will take you the same amount of time to sail across it: this is Ubisoft's "biggest open world" offering, in the words of former creative director Elisabeth Pellen.

Brotato arrived on Game Pass today, so you too can enjoy creating problems in your life. I might try to pique your interest with caveated comparisons to Vampire Survivors (and previously have), but I'd rather tell you that what hooked me in the wave survival shmup is constant little opportunities to push your luck and skill trying to create advantages. Death or glory. Likely death. But what if glory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A story about a girl who has a ghost best friend nobody else can see, and has to juggle that relationship with her interactions with living people? Sounds fake. Haha, but seriously folks. There's a demo for Paper Ghost Stories: Third Eye Open in the Steam Next Fest, and boy howdy did I like just looking at this game in motion. The clue is in the name, as all the characters look like 2D paper cut out dolls, and all the environments are like papercraft models. It's pretty gorge.
Third Eye Open, out this year, is inspired by the Joss-Papercraft of Southeast Asia (indeed, the start menu is a stage). You play as Ting, a pre-adolescent girl living in Malaysia with her parents. Ting discovers her supernatural ability to see ghosts at a camp, where she meets Xiu, a ghost girl about her own age. The two become friends, and the demo starts in media res when the two are back home.

This is mostly to help the team nip any launch day bugs in the bud a lot sooner during the week, rather than have them lingering in the game over the weekend.

Rocksteady’s long-awaited live service shooter is aggressively unambitious and seemingly petrified of risk, marrying tight, combo-ratcheting, flow-state combat with some awfully familiar and conventional loot-chasing guff.

        <updated>2024-02-06T16:02:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, there are games that come out that are made with real models. They're sometimes called "handmade" games, implying pure coders use their prehensile toes, but I really like it every time I see one because I love models. I like little versions of regular things! I just think they're neat. But it really is every so often, presumably because it takes even longer to make a tiny little man out of twigs and spit and scan him into a computer than it does to make him in the computer to start with. Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.
Harold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

Miniatures is not one of those games. Oh certainly you will open boxes and organise items and assemble furniture in its Steam Next Fest demo, but it's not cute or colourful or wholesome. Miniatures is more of a psychological horror game, laden with tension and uncertainty. For such a short demo, it built a great mood, and I'm excited for the full game to come later this year.

Or maybe that should be struck gold, as this mining roguelike is all about collecting little gem-like nuggets while boring deep underground for treasure and fending off all manner of flying eyeballs, bats and other unmentionable horrors with wings. I've been playing its Steam Next Fest demo this morning, and my initial impression is that it's a little bit Dome Keeper, a little bit SteamWorld Dig, and very, very good. Even better, developers 8BitSkull have just announced it's coming out in full next month.

It's being published by Tencent, who apparently acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring back in 2022 and put a few dozen people to work on a prototype, even as the company acquired a 16% stake in Elden Ring developer From Software.
All that's according to Reuters, who cite three sources "familiar with the matter". I realise that "free-to-play mobile version of Elden Ring with in-app purchases" is a phrase tailormade to give certain players hives and/or cause the speaker to be struck by lightning, but much as I can't help looking over cliff edges, I do find the idea fascinating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest haul of Steam Next Fest demos is so vast that I initially missed Tribes 3: Rivals, a game I’ve been cautiously coveting, among them. While this high-speed FPS has been playable in a number of semi-open alpha tests already, trying it out is now as easy as sliding into its Steam page and hitting the big green demo download button.
The demo launch is accompanied by a shiny new trailer, showing more of Rivals’ skiing shenanigans, aurally satisfying airshots, and flag-throwing tricks that I will never, ever be able to successfully pull off in a real match. Also, a confirmation that it’s launching into early access, though there’s no date beyond “soon.”

Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming "business update event." You can see the post for yourself below.
We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.
What do you think Xbox will announce next week? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't expect anyone to buy this monitor - but I'm absolutely entranced by a $700 discount on a gaming monitor that brings it down to "just" $1800. To be fair, this is essentially two 32-inch 4K 240Hz monitors without the gap in the middle, with a Mini LED backlight that delivers 1000-nit HDR highlights, an absolute beast of a monitor... but I'm guessing that most people that can drop nearly $2000 on a monitor aren't waiting for a deals post on Rock Paper Shotgun to do so. 
Still, I can dream, and this monitor is pretty cool, so let's take a closer look at this absolute bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Intel's best value CPUs for gaming is even better value than usual this week, as the Core i5 12400F is down to just £125 at Amazon. That's more than £75 cheaper than the 13th and 14th-gen equivalents, which add on only meagre levels of performance, and a great price for a CPU that can use the same DDR4 or DDR5 motherboards with PCIe 5.0 support. If you're building an Intel-based gaming PC, I'd argue that this is the best budget option going!

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.]]></summary>

On the surface, this might look like your typical fantasy dungeon crawler, but Pyrene has some neat tricks of its own, combining its own blend of resource gathering and roguelike citybuilding with Inscryption's number-crunching battles and a dash of Foretales' card-based exploration. And it has a lovely piano soundtrack to boot, too.

But in the years that followed, after you'd been sent to the slammer for crashing through my window bellowing about cheap Audible subscriptions, I might have checked out games like Ghost Trick and Phantom Brigade - each sort of an exercise in placing actions on a timeline like audio layers to produce a winning composition - and thought "hey, that hysterical burglar was onto something".
I wouldn't say there's an abundance of games in which you place actions on timelines, mind you. But those that do exist are neat, as Marge Simpson would say. Take Tarnished Blood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity."
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.
According to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …]]></summary>

For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find.

It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for Game Informer (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.
There is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.

I am not a fan of the genre Suicid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 
Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 
Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 


All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.

Sonic Mania is widely regarded as one of the blue blur’s best games. More than six years after its 2017 release, that sentiment remains as strong as ever, even after recent outings like 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and this year’s Sonic Superstars. While published by Sega, longtime Sonic fans who grew up playing the series, like Christian Whitehead, Hunter Bridges, Dave Padilla, Brad Flick, Tom Fry, and others, led the game’s development. And without speculating too much, the degree of separation afforded to these fans-turned-developers allowed Sonic Mania to feel l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.
Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.

WWE 2K has steadily climbed the ladder of quality over the past two entries. A strong comeback in 2K22 saw initiative but meaningful improvements in 2K23, and the series is arguably the strongest it's ever been. But a new year means another opportunity to retain the title for best wrestling sim or drop it to someone else. On the morning of the Royal Rumble last Saturday, I got to sample WWE 2K24’s notable new additions at a special preview event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.
Sonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.
In July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. "Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," Iizuka says. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time."
By adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.
Sonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.
The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. 


Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.
If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 


Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 
He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."]]></summary>
