        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until I played Tales Of Kenzera: Zau I figured people had run out of ways to make original platformers, but an Afrofuturist story-in-a-story framing for a mythological platformer about healthy ways to deal with grief sure did teach me to not underestimate human creativity. I really liked a lot about Tales Of Kenzera, and got annoyed by a bunch of stuff too - and the division seems to be that a lot of the former falls on the story and design side, and the latter on the mechanical side, which I guess isn't ideal for a platformer. But still, I think it's worth persevering.

As modding is a key part of the Fallout experience on PC, it should come as no surprise that Nexus Mods, too, is buckling under pressure.


Notably, Nexus Mods is one of the biggest mod-hosting websites on the Internet, and it's been struggling with the sudden influx of Fallout traffic for days now. As per Nexus Mods' own report, the site has been experiencing "much more traffic than usual due to the popularity of the Fallout TV series." The announcement explains that the site has already deployed additional resources and monitoring to keep up with the demand, but the problems are persisting still.

The Switch is no stranger to an arcade racer or two. While it's all well and good playing these with a standard Joy-Con or Pro Controller set-up, this latest dock prototype from Far East Pinball has left us firmly of the belief that the likes of Out Run should be played no other way.
Is it a pure novelty? Maybe. But the independent manufacturer's arcade-inspired add-on at least appears to be the most authentic way of capturing that driving cabinet feel from the comfort of your own home (albeit on a much smaller scale).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the games never fully left the limelight, the recent Fallout TV show – with a second season now confirmed – has increased the franchise's popularity in a pretty big way. With that in mind, it will not surprise a single person reading this that some of the games have experienced a big uptick in concurrent players.


For example: Fallout 76 saw a player count of 73,368 on PC in the last 24 hours or so, according to data from SteamDB. The chart itself gives a visual representation of this increase and while the numbers are not as strong as, say, Fallout 4, it's still a testament to the TV show's success.




Likewise, the third entry – specifically the Game of the Year edition – also saw an increase in popularity, with a new peak concurrent player count of 11,471. New Vegas has also been getting some love, with 43,632 people playing over the weekend, just a few thousand shy of the player count record that was set some 14 years ago.


Not just the newer games, either


While the original Fallout installment from way back in the day hasn't bested its peak, more people do seem to be playing it lately. However, the 1998 sequel is showing a new peak concurrent player number on Steam. It's good to see the older entries still pulling in fans.


In fact, from what I can tell, Fallout 4 is the only mainline game that hasn't hit a new record since the show aired, which is kind of surprising seeing as it's probably the most successful one in the series in terms of sales. Although having said that, it's been consistently popular since it was released.


Oh look, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel has a new record number of Steam players as well. Okay, it's only 243, but it kind of hammers home the influence the recent adaptation has had.

The good news is, at the time of writing, Throne and Liberty is planned for a Western release. The game is developed and published in South Korea by NCSoft but, back in February 2023, Amazon announced it had entered an agreement to publish Throne and Liberty in North America, South America, Europe, and Japan. So, it's a matter of when it'll come out in the West, not if.

As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

Atari has had a very interesting few years, publishing a critically acclaimed 50th-anniversary collection in the form of a playable documentary, the ‘Recharged’ series of neo-retro revivals, and a handful of unique reinventions of its classic IPs. Lunar Lander Beyond from Cris Tales developer Dreams Uncorporated is the gaming pioneer’s latest and most polished retro overhaul to date.
Lunar Lander Beyond casts itself as a reboot of Atari’s iconic 1979 arcade game in which players navigate a spacecraft toward the surface of the Moon rendered in glorious monochrome vector graphics, using thrusters to slow the ship's descent and ultimately land safely (easier said than done) to score points. It’s a dawn-of-the-arcade-era classic that demands patience and precision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Fallout 4 is arguably the easiest game in the series to get into for people who just got hella hyped about this world because of the Fallout TV show, it still features some strange blind spots when it comes to making some mechanics clear for players.


We've previously talked about how to recharge fusion cores, an essential but somehow not very well-explained part of getting your Power Armor to work, so let's now talk about how to get out of your Power Armor, as nobody wants to get unnecessarily trapped in a metal coffin forever.


A Power Armor is a great tool to use in the job of fixing Wasteland, if you know what I mean, and its simplified use in Fallout makes a lot of sense. What doesn't make much sense, however, is how the game doesn't do a great job of explaining how to exit it, so here goes:



PC: Hold the E key until the character exits the armor


PlayStation: Hold the X button until the character exits the armor


Xbox: Hold the A button until the character exits the armor



 In case you've changed the key bindings for some reason, the rule is that the key or button you use to exit the armor is the same one you used to enter it.


It's an extremely simple action to perform, but only once you know how to do it, and the game only explains it in a brief message once you find a power armor station.




Screenshot via Destructoid


 Even worse, you can hold down the correct button for 90% of the time required to hold it to exit the armor, and the game still won't tell you that you're about to trigger an action.


You can play Fallout 4 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. You can now watch the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime.

That's because fans of the game are desperate to see Exotic weapons come back to the island. They were first added to the battle royale back in Chapter 2, but were vaulted at the end of Chapter 4. While there are still some incredible Mythic items like the Thunderbolt of Zeus or the Avatar bending abilities, they don't quite feel the same. 


That's because Exotic weapons are not new items, but upgraded versions of guns already in the game, just with added abilities and stronger stats. In a post on the official Fortnite subreddit, Kingofcracker wrote: "I can't be the only one who wants ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famed mass-layoff-manufacturing corporation Embracer Group are dividing into three companies, which will be listed separately on Sweden’s stock exchange. Those companies are: Asmodee Group, which comprises Embracer’s tabletop games biz; Coffee Stain & Friends, an evolution of the existing Coffee Stain publisher, who will pursue "a dual focus on indie and A/AA premium and free-to-play games for PC/console and mobile"; and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends, “a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, as well as the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties, among many others”. 

After writing roughly 100,000 posts about Embracer’s butchering of vast swathes of the games industry, this is surely my chance to raise a cheer and celebrate the conglomerate’s unglomming with a cool glass of turnip juice, but it is Monday, the man next door is shouting again, and I am tired - so tired that only ill-suited Simpsons references come to mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you like your camo and want to take a closer look at your gun? Then you need to know how to inspect your weapon, and I know exactly how you can do it. 


It's crazy to think that inspecting a weapon wasn't a thing in Call of Duty for a long, long time. In fact, it wasn't until summer 2020 that we were first able to take a closer look at our guns when it was added to Warzone and 2019's Modern Warfare. 


Now, I hardly go a game without doing it, which probably isn't the best habit to be in. Still, if you want to give it a go, here's how you can do it. 


I'm constantly inspecting my weapon in MW3. Screenshot via Destructoid


How to inspect weapons in MW3 using controller


If you're using a controller, you can hold left on your D-Pad to start the weapon inspection animation. 


This works on any controller and platform, so don't worry if you're on PC, Xbox, or PlayStation, as they all work the same. 


How to inspect weapons in MW3 using keyboard


You can inspect your weapons in MW3 by pressing I on your keyboard. This will then start the animation.


How to cancel weapon inspection animation in MW3


To cancel the animation, simply switch weapons, aim down the sight, or fire the gun in your hand. Your character will immediately stop looking at the weapon, and you can get back into the action. 


This is very useful, as I often hit the animation while running around without even thinking about it. Being able to cancel it by using the ADS function means I can get straight into a gunfight without being at a disadvantage.


Why doesn't weapon inspection work in MW3 campaign?


Weapon inspection doesn't actually work in MW3's campaign, as the animation is not present. So, no matter how many times you hit the input, nothing will happen.

This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.
Created by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to find a new flat in London. This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a "studio apartment". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. 


Lucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must "draft" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie series that started in 2020 has delivered entertaining adventures starring everybody's favorite Blue Blur and his ever-growing stable of friends. One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago, I jokingly predicted it would only be a matter of time until a sick Elden Ring fan beat the game using something silly like a deadly venom-filled jellyfish as a controller. I couldn't have been more wrong. Players are seemingly getting serious and building the weapons they see in the game and turning them into the controllers they'll use to take over the Lands Between.


That's the story of Louis 64, a YouTuber and likely contender to the title of IRL Elden Lord, who's just shown his greatsword-shaped controller. If you look at the video below, you'll notice that he's not talking about a greatsword with some buttons on it, like that legendary Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller from 20 years ago, but rather about a motion controller than Louis swings in real life to get his character to replicate his moves in the game. 




That's damn heavy, absolutely wild, and possibly even dangerous — at least for all of the stuff Louis has on his walls, as one commenter on Twitter states. Still, I wouldn't worry too much, as it's far from Louis' first adventure in swordsmithing. He'd recently made a buster sword that he used to bust Final Fantasy Remake with.




And he's also the mind behind the absolutely bonkers idea of beating Elden Ring with a literally absolutely bananas controller:




I'm sure Miyazaki would be extremely proud.


You can now play Elden Ring on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The highly anticipated Shadow Of The Erdtree will come out on June 21.

The most played titles in the genre, FFXIV: A Realm Reborn and World of Warcraft, may as well have been released when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Still, MMO fans do hold on to some hope, as a handful of in-development MMOs seem to be making positive steps toward release. Of those, Pax Dei is one of the most promising.


A medieval age-inspired MMO running in UE5, Pax Dei is about to start its Alpha 2 test, showing off further development as they open servers to over 100,000 people. What can players expect from this newest look at Pax Dei? This article will go over the focuses of this Alpha test so that players can understand what the game has developed and where the game may be going as it gets closer and closer to release.

Those in Quincy have an ability called Voltstanding to chase that's so powerful it can pretty much wipe the floor with anything you come up against. But don't think for a second that it'll be easy to unlock.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Type Soul has a variety of factions from the action-packed anime Bleach, each with their own special weapons and abilities. If the Quincies from the Thousand Year Blood War have caught your eye and you’ve chosen to side with them, then the first ability you’ll be looking to unlock is Schrift. 


How to get Schrift in Type Soul



Must be a part of the Quincy faction


Reach Grade 2 Quincy, which can be done by completing a few missions 



After reaching Grade 2 as a Quincy, find Balance at the top of Wandenreich Castle and speak with him. You will then need to go down to the Worshipper Statue near where players first become Quincies. After interacting with it, three different texts will appear on your screen, which mentions three different enemy types.


Now comes the challenging part of the questline: To obtain a Schrift, you must defeat the three enemy types assigned to you without dying. Since dying will reset all quest progress, keeping a checklist of the enemies you’ve killed will be helpful since there isn’t a quest tracker in Type Soul to let you know when you’ve completed the hunt. 


Enemies to defeat


The possible required enemies to defeat are:



5 Arrancars


5 Shinigamis


2 Adjuchas


5 Menoses


15 Fishbones



After fulfilling the above requirements, return to the Worshipper Statue and interact with it. You will respawn back in Wandenreich City and be designated a random Schrift from the following types:



Heat (Common)


Wind (Common)


Thunderbolt (Rare)


Fear (Legendary)


Miracle (Legendary)



With the Quincies’ primary combat ability in hand, you can continue your journey through Type Soul and work on acquiring the best Quincy weapons.

Last week, Aspyr released the second major update for Tomb Raider I-III Remastered, and while it's added a new outfit, it's also supposedly removed some posters in the game according to multiple player reports.
Although there does not appear to be any mention of this in the latest patch notes, Tomb Raider fans on social media and elsewhere have highlighted how "Lara's pinup" posters in the fourth level of Tomb Raider III (titled 'Sleeping with the Fishes') have now disappeared from the first room of this level. Unsurprisingly, there's been a mixed reaction to this discovery online.

Remember your Ifrit combos! The few chances you get within melee range need to be used effectively.

(Square x4, Triangle x2)




The fight against Leviathan is a long one broken up into multiple sections. You're not fighting the health bar so much as you're fighting the stamina bar to trigger the next cinematic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is over.
The PS1 played host to a staggering number of memorable and influential RPGs, one of which was Konami’s Suikoden. After that strong debut came a handful of sequels that eventually puttered out during the sixth generation of consoles, and Konami has virtually abandoned the series since. Not ones to be stifled, some key members of the Suikoden crew eventually left Konami and founded a new team called Rabbit & Bear, which started a successful crowdfunding campaign for this spiritual successor called Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. After a four-year development cycle, Eiyuden Chronicle is finally in our hands and while it has its share of issues, this is overall a deeply enjoyable and nostalgic JRPG that we’re sure is going to get a lot of love.
The story is set in the fictional land of Allraan and begins by focusing on the rising tensions between the powerful imperial country of Galdea and a neighboring province called the League of Nations. Though there are technically three protagonists to this narrative, your main character to begin with is Nowa, a chipper young man from a quiet border village who joins a small peacekeeping military unit for the League of Nations. Nowa and his band go about their business quelling bandit raids and helping people to the best of their ability, but soon find themselves caught in the middle of much larger political tension that eventually gives way to war between the Empire and the League. To reclaim his homeland and avenge his losses, Nowa thus sets out to build a resistance and defeat the Galdeans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the spiritual successor to a classic JRPG called Suikoden, and it came to be thanks to a very successful Kickstarter campaign. As someone with little knowledge of Suikoden, I went into Hundred Heroes thinking it was going to be a dense, old-fashioned, and slightly impenetrable time. And yes, some of it is annoying and obtuse and will almost certainly suit veterans who enjoy those quirks, but it has a surprisingly easy going nature. Hundred Heroes accomodates new players like me with combat that's simple to grasp and a story that's emotional and sprawling and absolutely worth your time.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” A small child dressed as legally distinct Sailor Moon chirped this trite little phrase at me about an hour into Rabbit and Bear’s Suikoden successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. I’m not sure when I realized the adage applies to Hundred Heroes itself as much as it did to whatever the child was talking about. It might’ve been after I met a cleric whose vices included violence and foul language; but whenever it was, it encouraged me to overlook the misgivings Hundred Heroes’ poor …]]></summary>

I’ll never forget my first proper tanking experience in FFXIV. My FC (Free Company) mates at the time, whom I will honestly never forgive but always be grateful to, insisted I give the role a try. They promised to go easy on me and promised I’d be fine. Reluctantly, I agreed. I was among friends; it couldn’t be that bad, right?

In our review here on Nintendo Life, we mentioned how the combat was unique and accessible (even if it did get a little repetitive at times) and noted how the story was told in a subtle, heartfelt way. There were some other setbacks tied to performance but overall it was a fun game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poslední měsíc byl plný zajímavých akcí, o kterých Vám bastlíři z projektu MacGyver mohou povědět, protože se na ně sami vydali. Kde všude byli, ptáte se? Objevili se na Installfestu, Arduino Day, Hackaday Europe a tajném srazu bastlířů z Twitteru. A z každé akce pro vás mají zajímavé poznatky.

Kromě reportáží a zážitků mají samozřejmě i jiné novinky - Průša pracuje na skříni pro XL, která bude mít i měření teploty, řízený odtah a filtry. Na trhu se objevil zajímavý osciloskop, který obsahuje i zdroj, multimetr, generátor, spektrální analyzátor a uvnitř zabudovaný interpreter MicroPythonu. A ST zavádí nové technologie u svých procesorů.

Ze světa hardwaru můžou zmínit nové výkonné desky s podporou pro Arduino včetně PLC od Finderu. Také se objevila spousta zajímavé literatury pro milovníky precizní techniky. Poreferovat se dá i o věcech, co nově vyzkoušeli - kupříkladu levnou (ale přesto funkční a pohodlnou) pájecí pinzetu, jak se dělají teardrops v KiCADu 8 nebo jak na IBIS modely zdarma.

Pokud jde o software či jeho kombinaci s hardwarem, třeba dojde řeč na zranitelnost zámků Saflok, backdoor v XZ utils, dokumentační nástroj pro kabeláž nebo ST-Link s integrovaným power profilerem.

Samozřejmě svoje místo budou mít i bizarní témata, třeba jak změna časového pásma způsobí, že eDoklady budou tvrdit, že jste se narodili v jiný den. Kanada se snaží bojovat s větrnými mlýny zákazem Flipper Zero, IRC klient přímo v UEFI, jak umístit video do QR kódu nebo proč vznikla panika z UV světla vycházejícího z RGB LED.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 22. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

XDefiant is a fast-paced first-person shooter for fans of most of the Tom Clancy franchises Ubisoft has released a game for. It includes factions from The Division, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and even Splinter Cell. However, it comes with all the issues that most online shooters face, including bugs and errors that can plague a community for days on end. One of the biggest is the Mike-01 error, which happens to have a relatively simple fix for those who need it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a new Cammy statue for your collection, Prime 1 Studios has you covered with its latest tease. 


Prime 1 Studios is known for its truly breathtaking, almost terrifyingly realistic statues (seriously, this T-1000 would terrify me if it was in the corner of my apartment). 


Prime 1 also makes a fair number of premium gaming statues, including simply gorgeous lines based on Bloodborne and Devil May Cry. It's also working hard on Street Fighter statues, including an upcoming Cammy statue, which the studio revealed a first look at on Twitter. 




Cammy is the latest in a line that already includes Ryu, Akuma, and Chun-Li. The statue, which depicts Cammy in her modern Street Fighter 6 costume, is crazy gorgeous, though. 


For the statue, Cammy is in her traditional victory pose, with her back turned and giving the viewer a steely gaze. The photos show off an incredible level of detail, from the texture of the jacket to the incredible face sculpt. The statue also gets a cameo from Cammy's cat, which makes perfect sense to anyone who knows just how much she loves her feline friends. 


The Prime 1 Studios Cammy 1/4 scale statue doesn't yet have a price point or release date, or details on included accessories, though details should be announced soon. Looking at the other releases in the line, fans can likely expect multiple head portraits to be included--as well as a price upwards of $1,000. 


For fans looking for more, rest assured, Cammy is not the end of the line. Teases for statues of Marisa and Juri are already floating around on the Prime 1 website.

A scoop by PCgamer foretells that the Real-time strategy genre might be about to make a comeback, as Starcraft 2's multiplayer lead developer David Kim revealed in a documentary that he's working on a new RTS project aimed at completely changing the landscape.






In this new Noclip documentary, Redefining the Game: A Paradigm Shift for the RTS Genre, Uncapped Games showed their plans for a new real-time strategy game with a much broader appeal than the previous games in the genre. 


One of the core problems of the RTS genre is its inherent level of difficulty, or, perhaps, the level of difficulty that most strategy games have accustomed us to.

The big news this week was Nintendo's first Indie World of the year which didn't bring us that game but did provide plenty of goodies including Little Kitty, Big City, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate and SteamWorld Heist II. Nintendo also kicked off its Indie eshop Sale on the same day — weird how that lined up, eh?

However, one piece of the Star Wars Outlaws puzzle I did not get a chance to experience firsthand is the space gameplay. Thankfully, in addition to playing a chunk of Star Wars Outlaws during my time in Malmö, Sweden, I also had a chance to ask the developers how the game works once you jump into your ship and leave the planet or moon.

Dawntrail’s benchmark is especially noteworthy as it’s the first time we’ve really been able to put the MMO’s much-anticipated graphical update arriving with 7.0 into practice and see what sort of demands it might make on our hardware by overhauling the 10-year-old game’s visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

Remember the Indie World showcase from earlier this week? It was sweet, huh? Well, to show just how sweet it was, Nintendo has today taken to Twitter to release its regular infographic highlighting all of the titles that were featured.
Now it's true, this Indie World graphic might not be quite as stacked with icons as those that we have seen from full-fat Directs in the past (even the February Partner Direct one was beefier, if we're honest), but it's still a handy one-stop shop to see the full lineup at a glance either and we are particular fans of some of the logos on show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom are working on another Dragon's Dogma 2 patch, and this one takes as its target the dreaded dragonsplague, which causes the game's AI-controlled pawns to go nuts and murder everybody, including story-critical NPCs, if you allow it to go untreated for long enough. It'll reduce the infection frequency of dragonsplague, which is spread when pawns mingle with other pawns online, and make the symptoms more obvious. Pawns already get glowing eyes when they're dragonsplagued - I guess they'll be all the glowier in future.

If you cast your mind back to 2021, you might remember how PowerA set out to light up our gaming lives with the Spectra controller. This officially licensed pad appeared much the same as your standard Pro Controller on the surface but it was capable of putting on an LED light show while gaming.
All in all, it was a pretty neat device, though its wired requirements kept us tethered to the TV in a way that we weren't so keen on. 'A wireless version sure would be nice,' we thought to ourselves all those years ago. 'PowerA should really get on that.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While trying to keep vaguely up on both games discourse and terminology over long periods of time, I frequently find myself noticing terms enter common usage, get used a bunch, then fall out of favour again. I think this is partly because games discourse is cyclical, and partly because writing and talking about the same things a lot means that when a neater phrase for something complicated pops up, it gets assimilated quickly. Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any. Uh, (looks at monitor), Asus? Do Asus do cars? The 1994 Asus Gremlin. What a ride!

Nintendo's marketing campaign for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is well underway at this point (as you would hope, given its 23rd May release date) and that means we are getting to see a lot about what the remake has in store.
A new short trailer shared on Twitter today contains some fresh footage of the game, giving us our first look at select locations, map reveal animations and, perhaps most importantly, the cloudy chapter boss Smorg — who's looking just as intimidating as we would have hoped.

This update, which reveals the studio is still hard at work on the game, arrives after an unspecified number of layoffs hit Telltale Games last October. 
"We've been quiet because we've been heads down, focusing on the promise of [The Wolf Among Us 2]," the update reads. "While we can't give a big update yet, here's a little something for you: in-progress shots from the current build. The work continues. The Fabletown gang will be back. Thanks for being fans." 
The four in-progress shots from the current build of The Wolf Among Us 2 can be viewed below: 

The Wolf Among Us 2 was originally due out last year but was delayed out of 2023 in a March update from the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 
Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say "Pah! You should play Stardew Valley."
1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.

This news arrives just over a week after the series' release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Fallout review, so we're excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2's production.

Fallout joins a string of other hit Amazon Prime Video series currently airing on the streamer service, like The Boys (with a new season dropping June 13) and Invincible, which just had its second season wrap up. It also joins a string of other successful video game adaptations, like HBO's The Last of Us, which is getting a Season 2 next year, Peacock's Twisted Metal, Netflix's Arcane, and Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
Fallout Season 1 is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It'll grow on you.
Kudzu came to this reviewer during a significant birthday celebration. The day was filled with echoes of our past. There was the music on the radio – uncanny remixes of early-to-mid-90s techno songs that used to hype up pre-teen candyfloss-fuelled visits to funfairs. And there was Kudzu and its unsubtle similarity to all-time classic Zelda: Link’s Awakening in its 1993 original Game Boy iteration. It’s crazy to think that we played Link's Awakening to death now 30 years ago.
Time flies fast like an arrow from Link’s bow indeed.

It contains a whole new moon of developer Massive Entertainment's creation - Toshara, which is home to the Pyke criminal gang and visually defined by huge deposits of crystalline orange material and cities hacked out of mountains. What's it like adding a whole bloody world to Star Wars? Here are some quick thoughts from Massive Entertainment's creative director Julian Gerighty.

Serving a German audience, the streaming portal shut down in 2013, but that wasn't the end of the story. This week, a suspected operator of the site and an accomplice were charged by German authorities. The long delay is noteworthy but also lucrative; a Bitcoin haul with a current value of €3 billion was seized recently.

Anyone who owns the game on Steam can give these things a go, which is a bonus, too. I think I own it? I genuinely can't remember.

In fact, player reception to the recently released Beach Properties DLC has proven so un-sunny that both developers Colossal Order and publishers Paradox Interactive have issued a joint statement apologising for the state it launched in.
The letter, addressed to Cities fans and signed by Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen and Paradox Interactive deputy CEO Mattias Lilja, also promises refunds for anyone who bought Beach Properties. Or, in the case of those who got it through snapping up Skylines 2’s Ultimate Edition, compensation in the form of three Creator Packs and three radio stations. The contentious DLC is also going free to anyone who’s yet to put money down.

Commenting outside the Tokyo District Court on Thursday, Hoshino was clear: "I have no intention of paying anything."

Kingdom Come: Deliverance faced a rocky launch in 2018, with outlets (including Game Informer) criticizing its widespread bugs and general lack of polish, but it found success regardless, going on to sell two million copies and release a slate of DLC and updates. Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it's too early to speak to any performance issues, it's clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a treat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhorse have revealed Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, sequel to the 2018 open world action-RPG which you will likely remember for a couple of reasons: 1) its ostensibly faithful but inevitably skewed representations of race, gender and class in medieval Bohemia, which were amplified by its creative director Daniel Vávra's qualified endorsement of Gamergate, and 2) being a moderately entertaining, buggy and mucky chivalric fable in which you have to worry about keeping your sword sharp and eating food before it rots. 


Going by the announcement video, the new game is the same game but with more cash to burn. It's the work of 250 people, with Jan Valta returning as composer. According to Vávra, "what we are making now is what it was supposed to be in the beginning, but we were not able to do it because we didn't have enough resources and experience."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie. 
The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.]]></summary>

They have today announced a release date of May 7th for Nancy Drew: Mystery Of The Seven Keys, along with the official trailer.
This time Our Nance is heading to Prague, for a sort of old-world-meets-new story about hacking, medieval myths, and a stolen necklace. Nancy is hired to find said heirloom, and interview a bunch of suspects, one of whom is creepy puppet guy up there (there are no screens of Nancy because she never actually steps out from behind the camera in these games; she may as well be a cryptid). I realise this may not be of interest to regular readers of this site, but while I may not have seven keys, I do have one to the back end of this website, so nobody can stop me.

That game is Morels: The Hunt 2, released this week, and as you might guess, it is about finding and identifying various species of mushroom in lush, photorealistic wilderness locations. There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest. It feels a bit like developers Abrams Studios are unconvinced as to the popular appeal of mushroom hunting, and have garlanded the concept with random mythology so as to widen the Venn diagram overlap between "fungi fans" and "people who want to live in cyberpunk Narnia".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surreal pop synth of Sayonara Wild Hearts may have been the game that put Swedish developer Simogo on the map for PC players, but for me their earlier iOS puzzler Device 6 stands in my memory as being one of the most distinctive video games I've played. An interactive mystery novel at its heart, Device 6 took full advantage of its mobile-based hardware, asking players to turn and rotate their device to read certain lines of text, and scroll through its chapters searching for audio visual clues to solve its puzzles. I've often lamented that it never made its way to other platforms, even though part of its magic is inherently tied to physicality of its tactile origins.
Happily, after playing a few hours of Simogo's latest game, Lorelei And The Laser Eyes it's clear this equally classy detective story shares much of the same DNA as Device 6. It has the same love of riddles and mysterious, cryptic puzzles, only now they're writ large in a fully explorable 3D setting - a monochrome and maze-like hotel belonging to a reclusive artist. But Simogo's love of text hasn't been diminished in the process. Early on you find an instruction manual for Lorelei And The Laser Eyes within the game itself, which straight away tells you to have a pen and paper nearby to help solve its numerous conundrums. Heck, publishers Annapurna Interactive even sent me a full-blown notebook in the post just to hammer it home. They're not kidding, either. Even the opening section of the game had me scribbling down names, sums and symbols, much like Tunic, Return Of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did before it. Which is just as well, really, as I'll definitely be needing some reminders when I come to play the full version on May 16th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I briefly posted about this in The Maw, but was unsure at that point if SteamWorld Heist 2 was coming to PC day and date with the launch on Switch. That date is August 8th, by the way, and the answer is: yes it is! Though it was revealed at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase earlier this afternoon, strategy action-adventure-with-robots sequel SteamWorld Heist 2 isn't a timed platform exclusive, so that's fun!
SteamWorld Heist 2 is, if you hadn't guessed, a sequel to SteamWorld Heist, which came to PC in 2016. The first was a side-on tactics game where you, leading a team of robots, shot teams of other (bad) robots in turn-based skill-heavy tactical battles. While that all took place in space, the sequel has achieved splashdown, and you'll be chuntering about the seas with a new lead character (Captain Leeway) and a new bunch of crewmates. It's a robot pirate game, in other words.

Yes, the Easter eggs and references to heroes like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Black Panther, and more make this feel like an established universe full of superheroes, but Insomniac took things to the next level with its rogues' gallery.

You have to spend a bit to get the top performance, especially now with memory manufacturers slowing production and SSD makers offering fewer discounts as a result. Fortunately, the 2TB T500 does have a decent discount going at the moment, worth $51:
The T500 takes the title of best high-end PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD for gaming in the RPS best SSDs for gaming guide, and boasts ridiculous sequential speeds of up to 7400MB/s and 7000MB/s for read and writes respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years before she worked on top-drawer point-and-clickers Return To Monkey Island and Thimbleweed Park, Australian game developer Jenn Sandercock was a junior designer on Team Bondi's historical open world game L.A. Noire. Eventually published by Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar in 2011, L.A. Noire took seven years to make and is an especially notorious example of crunch culture and mismanagement. Sandercock joined in the middle of one such crunch period, and wanted to make life a little easier for her exhausted colleagues. "Everyone looked so miserable after literally years of hard work & crunch," she wrote on Twitter in 2018. "So late one night after work I baked 2 cakes for the office. I sent out a mass email & we all took 30 minutes to eat cake and talk." Sandercock began hosting weekly "Cake Days", baking a fresh batch in her own time to share around the office.


Rockstar were unimpressed, however. They thought Cake Day was evidence of poor productivity and, according to Sandercock, badgered Team Bondi leadership into forcing her to only share cake during official lunch hours. "Apparently the higher ups thought our entire office slacked off ALL the time because we had cake once a week," Sandercock wrote. She herself was told "that I was jeopardising my career". Sandercock hasn't let the demise of Cake Day cramp her creative interest in food, however. In fact, she's found a way to combine baking with game design. Sandercock is now the author of Edible Games, a book of recipes and instructions for concocting games out of food, and food out of games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.
New #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡

Tune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.

Watch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N
April 16, 2024
It's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.
If that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.
We won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.]]></summary>

The apparently much-beloved star slug will appear in every edition of the game, but if you scrape together the credits for the Gold or Ultimate Editions, you'll get access to a Jabba's Gambit mission as part of the game's season pass. 


It's a timely clarification, because I've just checked on Xitter and yes, #Jabbagate has been trending... in reference to unflattering photos of Donald Trump in 2016. And also, Steven Gerrard in 2020. And... Wrestlemania in 2017? Jabba is quite the meme these days, it seems.

Here, that’s Scottish electrician Caz McLeary and the crew of the Beira D rig. In bringing the rig to life, The Chinese Room turned to archival footage, oil and gas legislation, blueprints, and photographs. For lead designer Rob McLachlan, though, it was conversations with former platform workers that painted the clearest picture of what life on the rigs was really like.

Do these brazen publishers and developers not know that this, the year 2024, is the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog?
Sega said as much only a few days ago. They've announced a series of fan celebrations for Sonic Adventure 2's Ultimate Lifeform, beginning in the traditional style with a Shadow-themed MotoGP bike and an associated LEGO tie-in. And now, the earth quakes underfoot as we learn via The Hollywood Reporter that Keanu Reeves, forgotten star of 90s romantic drama A Walk in the Clouds and also those recent John Wick films, will play Shadow in the forthcoming movie adaptation Sonic 3.

Just as it’s smooth low-end performer on desktops, Manor Lords can easily keep its head above 30fps in handheld mode, and that’s usually more like 40-45fps with the right visual settings.
Still, there’s scope for it to become a much more Deck-friendly game, if not by its April 26th release date then hopefully at least during its early access phase. Faster performance would be nice, sure, but what this citybuilder-meets-RTS-battler really needs for optimal portability is a more refined set of controls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sort of reject that the Fallout TV show has Easter eggs hidden in it because it, as a whole, is the equivalent of one of those fancy Hotel Chocolat ostrich-sized patisserie collection bastards that cost 40 quid. However. Eagle-eyed viewers of the Fallout show noted that episode 6 gives you a number for Valt-Tec that you can actually get in touch with - 213-25-VAULT (or, 213-258-2858). Charges apply, as well as international codes if you're outside the US, which makes it 001-213-258-2858. 
If you text the number you get a reply from Vault-Tec saying "The next available appointment is 33 weeks from now, please stand by!" (handily captured by X user FanaticalGuy cos my response hasn't come through yet). And then the significantly less immersive "Reply Y to get recurring marketing and other texts from FallOut", which is quite funny. There is speculation that this is just a reference to Vault 33, the vault where main character Lucy was born and raised. On the other hand, 33 weeks from now is November, the month when both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 came out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail, arrives this summer alongside the game’s first graphical update. As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8]]></summary>

As you navigate the galaxy in Star Wars Outlaws, you do so as Kay Vess, a pickpocket-turned-thief who gets in over her head and winds up with a bounty on her head. Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a "resourceful underdog" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.
In the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…]]></summary>

Marxist policy choices mean the faction are now protesting in my coal mines, shutting down a vital heat pipeline and fomenting further dissent among the now freezing broader populace. It is, regrettably, time to talk. They want me to pass the Apex Workers decree, a darwinian shift towards culling the weak while enhancing the strong. That’ll mean a tasty increase to production efficiency, so I’m not complaining - but the Technocrats will, so the vote won’t pass unless I can persuade the Machinists, their less extreme cousins, to support the bill. Not to worry: I promise the Machinists they can choose the next law we vote on, and watch a chunk of undecided voters shift towards implied eugenics.
The Frostpunk 2 beta has rammed home how different my role is to Frostpunk 1’s dictator. I’m more of a smooth talkin’, palm-greasin’ mayor tasked with keeping a dozen ideologically-opposed plates spinning above a city that could be one harsh blizzard from disaster. I like it, even though at times this jaunt to the a-popsicle-ypse can feel less like solving a crunchy puzzle and more like wading through politics soup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.
We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb
April 15, 2024
The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.
The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.
Previous Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. 
If you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.

Alas, it did not sell well. Boss Key closed less than a year after launch, and the game soon followed. But after years of work, a group of fans this weekend successfully ran the first public test for a workaround to play the game again. While there's no clear launch plan yet, more playtesting will follow.

Posted on Xitter by SteamDB yesterday (HT to our pals at Eurogamer), it appears Fallout has more than doubled its concurrent players on Steam since the show dumped all its episodes last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2017 low-gravity hero shooter LawBreakers is coming back from the dead. However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.
LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. 
Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”
RELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. 
Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!

April 13, 2024
The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.
What did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of strategy and management game Goblin Stone, the goblins are nearly extinct. Getting murdered in large numbers by adventurers hungry for a quick experience point and a slack handful of coin will do that. I cannot tell you that you will want to bestow protection and prosperity on these gribbly green niblets. They exhibit a tweeness that you’ll either find charming or despicably manipulative, even when they’re showering in the blood of their enemies. Should you want to, though, Goblin Stone offers you the chance to rescue these maligned misfits from the brink of extinction, rebuilding their kingdom and leading them on outings to take the fight to all those heroes that have spotlight-hogged the left side of your screens for far too long.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/faq/2024/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-roguelike-and-rogue-lite"/>
        <updated>2024-04-13T20:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.
But the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.
“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. 
Rogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”
My hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.
“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”
To read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet series rolls on with the latest expansion. This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

But Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle apparently came out on Google Stadia - ah, that’d be why - back in 2020, and served up a massively (or at least medium-ly) multiplayer spin on the arcade classic. With Stadia dead and buried, Mega Tunnel Battle is chewing its way out of the streaming console’s grave with a new subtitle and a fresh Steam release next month.

It's just a walking simulator in which you explore a bunch of underground swimming pools. True, their size and layout defy explanation - what is this, a swimming pool for Slender Men? - but look, there are cute covered slides you can ride down in first-person. You know, like the ones you used to enjoy as a kid. Always that element of anxiety though about getting stuck halfway down, am I right?

It is, as it appears, an unabashed homage to Castlevania, but with none of the -vania, making it much more like the original (or the game boy ones, and possibly a few others in the series I don't know about): a straightforward, linear platform game about whipping monsters and not stepping on spikes. Ten a penny, right? But CNSBL captures it so well that it had me looking up old game boy tunes it vaguely reminded me of.

I say ancient rival, it’s been about 15 turns, but Horace said the column needed more drama and that Noctilus’ ongoing battle with the weevils to reclaim his biscuit tin ‘wasn’t testing well’ with the Treehouse’ preview audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online’s Super Nintendo catalog is three games larger today thanks to the additions of Super R-Type, Wrecking Crew ‘98, and Amazing Hebereke.


Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.]]></summary>

As an early access game, no less.
Having dug into the latest build’s GPU performance and graphics settings, I have found a few loose strands of technical flax that Manor Lords could do with snipping away. Yet it’s generally in good shape, both for early access and a solo developer project, successfully balancing strong visuals with relatively light hardware demands that should help it run on older PCs (or handhelds like the Steam Deck). Several hours in, the ugliest things I’ve seen are my road layouts.

The samurai epic, which tells a fictional story within a historical Japanese period of revolution, is one of the studio’s most ambitious titles from both game design and story perspectives. We got the opportunity to sit down with producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Fumihiko Yasuda to probe into how Rise of the Rōnin got made.
One aspect of the game that sets it apart from other Team Ninja titles is the monsters or demonic enemies that pervade its other games are nowhere to be seen in Rise of the Rōnin. Being set against a historical backdrop, Rōnin is limited just to human enemies of various fighting styles.


“This game is based in historical 19th century Japan,” Yasuda explains…]]></summary>

It’s anyone’s guess what Warhorse has in store, but there’s a solid chance the new game is a Kingdom Come sequel. Despite receiving mixed reviews at launch, it has gained a passionate following, and it was ported to Switch last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sketchy Fables is a hand-drawn, first-person adventure created by solo developer Alle Jong using 10,000 drawings. And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. 
As someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. 
Watch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


There's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, "Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure." Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. 
It's also "focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries," according to the page. 

As for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later.

I’ve never had much of a green thumb. For years, I largely believed growing a plant required little more than burying a seed in the dirt, pouring water, and letting the sun handle the heavy lifting.

On Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, "They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me."
He continues, adding, "As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf."

Dubbed V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania, this DLC includes new cosmetics that allow you to take on the aesthetics of hair, clothing, and forms of Konami's Castlevania franchise, and it will give players the chance to fight Simon Belmont, too. 
As for what to expect, the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack will give players Alucard's Cloak, Alucard's Coat, Alucard's Leggings, Alucard's Gloves, and Alucard's Boots. "The complete set can be crafted in-game when you unlock the tailor bench," the DLC's Steam description reads. "It costs cloth and coarse thread to make and is purely cosmetic. Using the new armor customization feature, you can don the garb of the Vampire Prince at any level of your vampire journey."

We learned last month that V Rising is coming to PS5 later this year, and according to the trailer above, the Legacy of Castlevania DLC will be available on the platform when the base game launches on it.

Pocketpair briefly pulled back the curtains on Palworld Arena during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, which is where we saw some of the gameplay from the arena in action. 
If the trailer is any indication, it appears to support splitscreen co-op and gives players the chance to fight head-to-head in an arena to see whose party of Pals is the strongest. 
Check it out for yourself in the Palworld Arena trailer below: 


"The Pal Arena makes its way to Palworld in 2024," the trailer's description reads. "Battle against other players, pitting both yourself and your pals against them. Train the strongest Pals and defeat all your rivals." 
That's all we know about the Palworld Arena, but since it's arriving this year, we might not have to wait too much longer to learn more. 
In the meantime, catch up on all things Palworld with Game Informer's Palworld primer, and then read about the latest update, which added the first Raid boss to the game alongside additional Pal and base changes, and more.

When I had the chance to go hands-on with The Rogue: Prince of Persia, I had only watched the credits roll on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a few nights ago. Before that, the last time I watched credits roll on a new Prince of Persia game was in 2010 with The Forgotten Sands. I was surprised and happy to play a new excellent Prince of Persia game this year, but considering how long I had to wait for that one, I was not holding my breath for another – not even the Sands of Time remake I have been patiently waiting for.
Which is to say it was incredibly surprising when Ubisoft reached out about its new Prince of Persia rogue-lite. It’s not a mode in Lost Crown or a spinoff, as I initiall…]]></summary>

The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown released in January, and today we learn about The Rogue: Prince of Persia, which will be entering early access in May.
The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows. The game is a 2D platformer roguelike that has a lot in common with Dead Cells, but after spending some hands-on time with the game, it also has its own identity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Publishing have released a new trailer for Mouse, the 1930s vintage cartoon-inspired FPS, and in it, we get gameplay featuring new traversal mechanics, power-ups, and more. Released during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, this new Mouse gameplay trailer highlights the grappling hook, helicopter, and Spinach power-up. 
As you might expect, the grappling hook allows players to target designated points in a level for rapid movement and traversal. The helicopter adds vertical traversal to players' arsenal with reduced descent speed, and finally, the Spinach power-up augments and enhances melee combat (in a nod to Popeye). 
Check out the latest Mouse gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


"Mouse is incredibly important to all of us here at Fumi Games, and we're committed to making sure that it lives up to all of the expectations," Fumi Games CEO Mateusz Michalak writes in a press release. "Our goal has always been to create a game that combines our passion for animation with our passion for first-person shooters. We are genuinely committed to collaborating closely with the Mouse community to craft a game that truly resonates with players. 
"We'll aim to share more details – whenever possible – as development progresses. Our partnership with PlaySide and our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you the finest grandboomer cartoon shooter ever created." 
Here are some new screenshots from Mouse for your viewing: 

Mouse was revealed back in 2023; it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Poncle has revealed that Vampire Survivors will finally hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 this summer. Before that, though, Vampire Survivors will cross over with Contra in Operation Guns, a new DLC featuring characters, weapons, and more from the series, on May 9. 
This was revealed during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a new trailer highlighting what Contra in Vampire Survivors looks like, and perhaps to nobody's surprise, it looks awesome. This trailer also reveals that PlayStation players can play Vampire Survivors this summer. The game is already available on Xbox, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. 
Check out the Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns and PlayStation reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Operation Guns looks like an exciting boost of weaponry, characters, enemies, and more to Vampire Survivors. And it's right around the corner, too, hitting the game on Xbox, PC, and Switch on May 9. It will presumably be available from the jump when Vampire Survivors hits PlayStation platforms later this summer.

        <updated>2024-04-10T17:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlaySide Studios has revealed Kill Knight, a new Hades-inspired isometric arcade shooter coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year. Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. 
"Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss," a press release for Kill Knight reads. "A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight's Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike." 
Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. 
As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight's Arsenal "and evolve your playstyle." In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. 
Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing: 

Kill Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish developer Northplay and publisher Ghost Ship Publishing have revealed Dinolords, a medieval real-time strategy game where you fight Vikings and defend your lands alongside dinosaurs and more. In a new teaser trailer published during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. 
"We're honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry," Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. "We've poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year." 
Check out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Northplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. 
Dinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.
Here are some Dinolords screenshots for your viewing:

More specifically, we'll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22. 
Attention, dear Hobbits! Mark your calendars for our #TalesoftheShire trailer on April 22! pic.twitter.com/aZXvmR8qUs
April 10, 2024
As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we're excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 
Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.
Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to "sense the movements of the deep sea." The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 


Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.
As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, "You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying."
Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released a new gameplay trailer for the Adventure Mode in the upcoming Switch-exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. In it, we get gameplay of the up-to-four-player mode that features 200 stages set across various different worlds, and it looks like a blast. 
Featuring both local and online four-player co-op, Adventure Mode will be available on day one when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble launches on Switch on June 25. Optional assist features, like Rewind and Ghost Guide, allow players to customize how their monkey ball experience plays. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble: Adventure gameplay trailer below: 


"While visiting a tropical island, AiAi and the gang meet a girl named Palette, an adventurer searching for the Legendary Banana," a press release reads. "They agree to join her on her journey across wondrous worlds to collect special parts said to be the key to localizing this prized relic. Along the way, they'll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals."
Adventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley. Each brings its own unique twist and challenge to the Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble experience. 
In Adventure Mode, players can utilize the Rewind feature to rewind to a previous point of a stage and re-attempt a particularly challenging section. The Ghost Guide option adds a transparent monkey alongside the player that demonstrates how to proceed, while the Route Guide will point you in the right direction if you're unsure of where to go. Plus, you can restart at any checkpoint within a stage at any time. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble hits Switch on June 25.

Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!
